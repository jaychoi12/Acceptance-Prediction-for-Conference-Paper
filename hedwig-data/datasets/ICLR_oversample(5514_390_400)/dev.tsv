10	"Generative models for singing voice have been mostly concerned with the task of ""singing voice synthesis,"" i.e., to produce singing voice waveforms given musical scores and text lyrics. In this work, we explore a novel yet challenging alternative: singing voice generation without pre-assigned scores and lyrics, in both training and inference time. In particular, we experiment with three different schemes: 1) free singer, where the model generates singing voices without taking any conditions; 2) accompanied singer, where the model generates singing voices over a waveform of instrumental music; and 3) solo singer, where the model improvises a chord sequence first and then uses that to generate voices. We outline the associated challenges and propose a pipeline to tackle these new tasks. This involves the development of source separation and transcription models for data preparation, adversarial networks for audio generation, and customized metrics for evaluation."
10	To analyze deep ReLU network, we adopt a student-teacher setting in which an over-parameterized student network learns from the output of a fixed teacher network of the same depth, with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Our contributions are two-fold. First, we prove that when the gradient is zero (or bounded above by a small constant) at every data point in training, a situation called  \emph{interpolation setting}, there exists many-to-one \emph{alignment} between student and teacher nodes in the lowest layer under mild conditions. This suggests that generalization in unseen dataset is achievable, even the same condition often leads to zero training error. Second, analysis of noisy recovery and training dynamics in 2-layer network shows that strong teacher nodes (with large fan-out weights) are learned first and subtle teacher nodes are left unlearned until late stage of training. As a result, it could take a long time to converge into these small-gradient critical points. Our analysis shows that over-parameterization plays two roles: (1) it is a necessary condition for alignment to happen at the critical points, and (2) in training dynamics, it helps student nodes cover more teacher nodes with fewer iterations. Both improve generalization. Experiments justify our finding.
10	We discuss the approximation of the value function for infinite-horizon discounted Markov Reward Processes (MRP) with nonlinear functions trained with the Temporal-Difference (TD) learning algorithm. We consider this problem under a certain scaling of the approximating function, leading to a regime called lazy training. In this regime the parameters of the model vary only slightly during the learning process, a feature that has recently been observed in the training of neural networks, where the scaling we study arises naturally, implicit in the initialization of their parameters.  Both in the under- and over-parametrized frameworks, we prove exponential convergence to local, respectively global minimizers of the above algorithm in the lazy training regime. We then give examples of such convergence results in the case of models that diverge if trained with non-lazy TD learning, and in the case of neural networks.
10	Graph-structured data such as social networks, functional brain networks, gene regulatory networks, communications networks have brought the interest in generalizing deep learning techniques to graph domains. In this paper, we are interested to design neural networks for graphs with variable length in order to solve learning problems such as vertex classification, graph classification, graph regression, and graph generative tasks. Most existing works have focused on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn meaningful representations of graphs, and more recently new convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been introduced. In this work, we want to compare rigorously these two fundamental families of architectures to solve graph learning tasks. We review existing graph RNN and ConvNet architectures, and propose natural extension of LSTM and ConvNet to graphs with arbitrary size. Then, we design a set of analytically controlled experiments on two basic graph problems, i.e. subgraph matching and graph clustering, to test the different architectures.  Numerical results show that the proposed graph ConvNets are 3-17% more accurate and 1.5-4x faster than graph RNNs. Graph ConvNets are also 36% more accurate than variational (non-learning) techniques. Finally, the most effective graph ConvNet architecture uses gated edges and residuality. Residuality plays an essential role to learn multi-layer architectures as they provide a 10% gain of performance.
01	We give a simple, fast algorithm for hyperparameter optimization inspired by techniques from the analysis of Boolean functions.  We focus on the high-dimensional regime where the canonical example is training a neural network with a large number of hyperparameters. The algorithm --- an iterative application of compressed sensing techniques for orthogonal polynomials --- requires only uniform sampling of the hyperparameters and is thus easily parallelizable. Experiments for training deep neural networks on Cifar-10 show that compared to state-of-the-art tools (e.g., Hyperband and Spearmint), our algorithm finds significantly improved solutions, in some cases better than what is attainable by hand-tuning.  In terms of overall running time (i.e., time required to sample various settings of hyperparameters plus additional computation time), we are at least an order of magnitude faster than Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization.  We also outperform Random Search $8\times$.   Our method is inspired by provably-efficient algorithms for learning decision trees using the discrete Fourier transform.  We obtain improved sample-complexty bounds for learning decision trees while matching state-of-the-art bounds on running time (polynomial and quasipolynomial, respectively). 
10	Machine learning models that take computer program source code as input typically use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. However, a major challenge is that code is written using an open, rapidly changing vocabulary due to, e.g., the coinage of new variable and method names.  Reasoning over such a vocabulary is not something for which most NLP methods are designed.  We introduce a Graph-Structured Cache to address this problem; this cache contains a node for each new word the model encounters with edges connecting each word to its occurrences in the code.  We find that combining this graph-structured cache strategy with recent Graph-Neural-Network-based models for supervised learning on code improves the models' performance on a code completion task and a variable naming task --- with over 100\% relative improvement on the latter --- at the cost of a moderate increase in computation time.
10	It has been argued that the brain is a prediction machine that continuously learns how to make better predictions about the stimuli received from the external environment. For this purpose, it builds a model of the world around us and uses this model to infer the external stimulus. Predictive coding has been proposed as a mechanism through which the brain might be able to build such a model of the external environment. However, it is not clear how predictive coding can be used to build deep neural network models of the brain while complying with the architectural constraints imposed by the brain. In this paper, we describe an algorithm to build a deep generative model using predictive coding that can be used to infer latent representations about the stimuli received from external environment. Specifically, we used predictive coding to train a deep neural network on real-world images in a unsupervised learning paradigm. To understand the capacity of the network with regards to modeling the external environment, we studied the latent representations generated by the model on images of objects that are never presented to the model during training. Despite the novel features of these objects the model is able to infer the latent representations for them. Furthermore, the reconstructions of the original images obtained from these latent representations preserve the important details of these objects.
10	We propose a variational inference approach to deep probabilistic video compression.  Our model uses advances in variational autoencoders (VAEs) for sequential data and combines it with recent work on neural image compression. The approach jointly learns to transform the original video into a  lower-dimensional representation as well as to entropy code this representation according to a temporally-conditioned probabilistic model. We split the latent space into local (per frame) and global (per segment) variables, and show that training the VAE to utilize both representations leads to an improved rate-distortion performance. Evaluation on small videos from public data sets with varying complexity and diversity show that our model yields competitive results when trained on generic video content. Extreme compression performance is achieved for videos with specialized content if the model is trained on similar videos.
10	Artificial neural networks are built on the basic operation of linear combination and non-linear activation function. Theoretically this structure can approximate any continuous function with three layer architecture. But in practice learning  the parameters of such network can be hard. Also the choice of activation function can greatly impact the performance of the network. In this paper we are proposing to replace the basic linear combination operation with non-linear operations that do away with the need of additional non-linear activation function. To this end we are proposing the use of elementary  morphological operations (dilation and erosion) as the basic operation in neurons. We show that these networks (Denoted as Morph-Net) with morphological operations can approximate any smooth function requiring less number of parameters than what is necessary for normal neural networks. The results show that our network perform favorably when compared with similar structured network. We have carried out our experiments on  MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.
10	In representational lifelong learning an agent aims to continually learn to solve novel tasks while updating its representation in light of previous tasks. Under the assumption that future tasks are related to previous tasks, representations should be learned in such a way that they capture the common structure across learned tasks, while allowing the learner sufficient flexibility to adapt to novel aspects of a new task. We develop a framework for lifelong learning in deep neural networks that is based on generalization bounds, developed within the PAC-Bayes framework. Learning takes place through the construction of a distribution over networks based on the tasks seen so far, and its utilization for learning a new task. Thus, prior knowledge is incorporated through setting a history-dependent prior for novel tasks. We develop a gradient-based algorithm implementing these ideas, based on minimizing an objective function motivated by generalization bounds, and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical examples. 
10	The weight initialization and the activation function of deep neural networks have a crucial impact on the performance of the training procedure. An inappropriate selection can lead to the loss of information of the input during forward propagation and the exponential vanishing/exploding of gradients during back-propagation. Understanding the theoretical properties of untrained random networks is key to identifying which deep networks may be trained successfully as recently demonstrated by Schoenholz et al. (2017) who showed that for deep feedforward neural networks only a specific choice of hyperparameters known as the `edge of chaos' can lead to good performance.We complete this analysis by providing quantitative results showing that, for a class of ReLU-like activation functions, the information propagates indeed deeper for an initialization at the edge of chaos. By further extending this analysis, we identify a class of activation functions that improve the information propagation over ReLU-like functions. This class includes the Swish activation, $\phi_{swish}(x) = x \cdot \text{sigmoid}(x)$, used in Hendrycks & Gimpel (2016),Elfwing et al. (2017) and Ramachandran et al. (2017). This provides a theoretical grounding for the excellent empirical performance of $\phi_{swish}$ observed in these contributions. We complement those previous results by illustrating the benefit of using a random initialization on the edge of chaos in this context.
10	Parametric texture models have been applied successfully to synthesize artificial images. Psychophysical studies show that under defined conditions observers are unable to differentiate between model-generated and original natural textures. In industrial applications the reverse case is of interest: a texture analysis system should decide if human observers are able to discriminate between a reference and a novel texture. For example, in case of inspecting decorative surfaces the de- tection of visible texture anomalies without any prior knowledge is required. Here, we implemented a human-vision-inspired novelty detection approach. Assuming that the features used for texture synthesis are important for human texture percep- tion, we compare psychophysical as well as learnt texture representations based on activations of a pretrained CNN in a novelty detection scenario. Additionally, we introduce a novel objective function to train one-class neural networks for novelty detection and compare the results to standard one-class SVM approaches. Our experiments clearly show the differences between human-vision-inspired texture representations and learnt features in detecting visual anomalies. Based on a dig- ital print inspection scenario we show that psychophysical texture representations are able to outperform CNN-encoded features.
01	Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to over-fit a dataset when being trained with noisy labels for a long enough time. To overcome this problem, we present a simple and effective method self-ensemble label filtering (SELF) to progressively filter out the wrong labels during training. Our method improves the task performance by gradually allowing supervision only from the potentially non-noisy (clean) labels and stops learning on the filtered noisy labels. For the filtering, we form running averages of predictions over the entire training dataset using the network output at different training epochs. We show that these ensemble estimates yield more accurate identification of inconsistent predictions throughout training than the single estimates of the network at the most recent training epoch. While filtered samples are removed entirely from the supervised training loss, we dynamically leverage them via semi-supervised learning in the unsupervised loss. We demonstrate the positive effect of such an approach on various image classification tasks under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise and at different noise ratios. It substantially outperforms all previous works on noise-aware learning across different datasets and can be applied to a broad set of network architectures.
10	Discovering objects and their attributes is of great importance for autonomous agents to effectively operate in human environments. This task is particularly challenging due to the ubiquitousness of objects and all their nuances in perceptual and semantic detail. In this paper we present an unsupervised approach for learning disentangled representations of objects entirely from unlabeled monocular videos. These continuous representations are not biased by or limited by a discrete set of labels determined by human labelers. The proposed representation is trained with a metric learning loss, where objects with homogeneous features are pushed together, while those with heterogeneous features are pulled apart. We show these unsupervised embeddings allow to discover object attributes and can enable robots to self-supervise in previously unseen environments. We quantitatively evaluate performance on a large-scale synthetic dataset with 12k object models, as well as on a real dataset collected by a robot and show that our unsupervised object understanding generalizes to previously unseen objects. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on robotic manipulation tasks, such as pointing at and grasping of objects. An interesting and perhaps surprising finding in this approach is that given a limited set of objects, object correspondences will naturally emerge when using metric learning without requiring explicit positive pairs.
10	Attention operators have been applied on both 1-D data like texts and higher-order data such as images and videos. Use of attention operators on high-order data requires flattening of the spatial or spatial-temporal dimensions into a vector, which is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. This not only incurs excessive requirements on computational resources, but also fails to preserve structures in data. In this work, we propose to avoid flattening by developing Kronecker attention operators (KAOs) that operate on high-order tensor data directly. KAOs lead to dramatic reductions in computational resources. Moreover, we analyze KAOs theoretically from a probabilistic perspective and point out that KAOs assume the data follow matrix-variate normal distributions. Experimental results show that KAOs reduce the amount of required computational resources by a factor of hundreds, with larger factors for higher-dimensional and higher-order data. Results also show that networks with KAOs outperform models without attention, while achieving competitive performance as those with original attention operators.
10	Deep neural networks exhibit complex learning dynamics due to the highly non-convex loss landscape, which causes slow convergence and vanishing gradient problems. Second order approaches, such as natural gradient descent, mitigate such problems by neutralizing the effect of potentially ill-conditioned curvature on the gradient-based updates, yet precise theoretical understanding on how such curvature correction affects the learning dynamics of deep networks has been lack- ing. Here, we analyze the dynamics of training deep neural networks under a generalized family of natural gradient methods that applies curvature corrections, and derive precise analytical solutions. Our analysis reveals that curvature corrected update rules preserve many features of gradient descent, such that the learning trajectory of each singular mode in natural gradient descent follows precisely the same path as gradient descent, while only accelerating the temporal dynamics along the path. We also show that layer-restricted approximations of natural gradient, which are widely used in most second order methods (e.g. K-FAC), can significantly distort the learning trajectory into highly diverging dynamics that significantly differs from true natural gradient, which may lead to undesirable net- work properties. We also introduce fractional natural gradient that applies partial curvature correction, and show that it provides most of the benefit of full curvature correction in terms of convergence speed, with additional benefit of superior numerical stability and neutralizing vanishing/exploding gradient problems, which holds true also in layer-restricted approximations.
01	High-dimensional time series are common in many domains. Since human cognition is not optimized to work well in high-dimensional spaces, these areas could benefit from interpretable low-dimensional representations. However, most representation learning algorithms for time series data are difficult to interpret. This is due to non-intuitive mappings from data features to salient properties of the representation and non-smoothness over time.To address this problem, we propose a new representation learning framework building on ideas from interpretable discrete dimensionality reduction and deep generative modeling. This framework allows us to learn discrete representations of time series, which give rise to smooth and interpretable embeddings with superior clustering performance. We introduce a new way to overcome the non-differentiability in discrete representation learning and present a gradient-based version of the traditional self-organizing map algorithm that is more performant than the original. Furthermore, to allow for a probabilistic interpretation of our method, we integrate a Markov model in the representation space.This model uncovers the temporal transition structure, improves clustering performance even further and provides additional explanatory insights as well as a natural representation of uncertainty.We evaluate our model in terms of clustering performance and interpretability on static (Fashion-)MNIST data, a time series of linearly interpolated (Fashion-)MNIST images, a chaotic Lorenz attractor system with two macro states, as well as on a challenging real world medical time series application on the eICU data set. Our learned representations compare favorably with competitor methods and facilitate downstream tasks on the real world data.
10	Generative models such as Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are typically trained for a fixed prior distribution in the latent space, such as uniform or Gaussian.After a trained model is obtained, one can sample the Generator in various forms for exploration and understanding, such as interpolating between two samples, sampling in the vicinity of a sample or exploring differences between a pair of samples applied to a third sample.In this paper, we show that the latent space operations used in the literature so far induce a distribution mismatch between the resulting outputs and the prior distribution the model was trained on. To address this, we propose to use distribution matching transport maps to ensure that such  latent space operations preserve the prior distribution, while minimally modifying the original operation. Our experimental results validate that the proposed operations give higher quality samples compared to the original operations.
10	  The increasing need for compact and low-power computing solutions for machine learning applications has triggered a renaissance in the study of energy-efficient neural network accelerators. In particular, in-memory computing neuromorphic architectures have started to receive substantial attention from both academia and industry. However, most of these architectures rely on spiking neural networks, which typically perform poorly compared to their non-spiking counterparts in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive spiking neuron model that can also be abstracted as a low-pass filter. This abstraction enables faster and better training of spiking networks using back-propagation, without simulating spikes. We show that this model dramatically improves the inference performance of a recurrent neural network and validate it with three complex spatio-temporal learning tasks: the temporal addition task, the temporal copying task, and a spoken-phrase recognition task. Application of these results will lead to the development of powerful spiking models for neuromorphic hardware that solve relevant edge-computing and Internet-of-Things applications with high accuracy and ultra-low power consumption.
01	We describe a new training methodology for generative adversarial networks. The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.
10	NFL(American football),which is regarded as the premier sports icon of America, has been severely accused in the recent years of being exposed to dangerous injuries that prove to be a bigger crisis as the players' lives have been increasingly at risk. Concussions, which refer to the serious brain traumas experienced during the passage of NFL play, have displayed a  dramatic rise in the recent seasons concluding in an alarming rate in 2017/18. Acknowledging the potential risk, the NFL has been trying to fight via NeuroIntel AI mechanism as well as modifying existing  game rules and risky play practices to reduce the rate of concussions. As a remedy, we are suggesting an effective mechanism to extensively analyse the potential concussion risks by adopting predictive analysis to project injury risk percentage per each play and positional impact analysis to suggest safer team formation pairs to lessen injuries to offer a comprehensive study on NFL injury analysis. The proposed data analytical approach differentiates itself from the other similar approaches that were focused only on the descriptive analysis rather than going for a bigger context with predictive modelling and formation pairs mining that would assist in modifying existing rules to tackle injury concerns. The predictive model that works with Kafka-stream processor real-time inputs and risky formation pairs identification by designing FP-Matrix, makes this far-reaching solution to analyse injury data on various grounds wherever applicable.
10	We release the largest public ECG dataset of continuous raw signals for representation learning containing over 11k patients and 2 billion labelled beats. Our goal is to enable semi-supervised ECG models to be made as well as to discover unknown subtypes of arrhythmia and anomalous ECG signal events. To this end, we propose an unsupervised representation learning task, evaluated in a semi-supervised fashion.  We provide a set of baselines for different feature extractors that can be built upon.  Additionally, we perform qualitative evaluations on results from PCA embeddings, where we identify some clustering of known subtypes indicating the potential for representation learning in arrhythmia sub-type discovery.
10	Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a highly popular model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approach. However, in continuous state and actions spaces and a Gaussian policy -- common in computer animation and robotics -- PPO is prone to getting stuck in local optima. In this paper, we observe a tendency of PPO to prematurely shrink the exploration variance, which naturally leads to slow progress. Motivated by this, we borrow ideas from CMA-ES, a black-box optimization method designed for intelligent adaptive Gaussian exploration, to derive PPO-CMA, a novel proximal policy optimization approach that expands the exploration variance on objective function slopes and only shrinks the variance when close to the optimum. This is implemented by using separate neural networks for policy mean and variance and training the mean and variance in separate passes. Our experiments demonstrate a clear improvement over vanilla PPO in many difficult OpenAI Gym MuJoCo tasks.
10	    We introduce the Mutual Information Machine (MIM), an autoencoder framework    for learning joint distributions over observations and latent states.     The model formulation reflects two key design principles: 1) symmetry, to encourage     the encoder     and decoder to learn different factorizations of the same     underlying distribution; and 2) mutual information, to encourage the learning     of useful representations for downstream tasks.     The objective comprises the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the encoding and     decoding joint distributions, plus a mutual information regularizer.     We show that this can be bounded by a tractable cross-entropy loss between     the true model and a parameterized approximation, and relate this to     maximum likelihood estimation and variational autoencoders.    Experiments show that MIM is capable of learning a latent representation with high mutual information,    and good unsupervised clustering, while providing NLL comparable to VAE     (with a sufficiently expressive architecture).
10	We introduce ``TriMap''; a dimensionality reduction technique based on triplet constraints that preserves the global accuracy of the data  better than the other commonly used methods such as t-SNE, LargeVis, and UMAP. To quantify the global accuracy, we introduce a score which roughly reflects the relative placement of the clusters rather than the individual points. We empirically show the excellent performance of TriMap on a large variety of datasets in terms of the quality of the embedding as well as the runtime. On our performance benchmarks, TriMap easily scales to millions of points without depleting the memory and clearly outperforms t-SNE, LargeVis, and UMAP in terms of runtime.
10	Quantization based methods are popular for solving large scale maximum inner product search problems. However, in most traditional quantization works, the objective is to minimize the reconstruction error for datapoints to be searched. In this work, we focus directly on minimizing error in inner product approximation and derive a new class of quantization loss functions. One key aspect of the new loss functions is that we weight the error term based on the value of the inner product, giving more importance to pairs of queries and datapoints whose inner products are high. We provide theoretical grounding to the new quantization loss function, which is simple, intuitive and able to work with a variety of quantization techniques, including binary quantization and product quantization. We conduct experiments on public benchmarking datasets \url{http://ann-benchmarks.com} to demonstrate that our method using the new objective outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. We are committed to release our source code.
10	We establish a theoretical link between adversarial training and operator norm regularization for deep neural networks. Specifically, we present a data-dependent variant of spectral norm regularization and prove that it is equivalent to adversarial training based on a specific $\ell_2$-norm constrained projected gradient ascent attack. This fundamental connection confirms the long-standing argument that a network's sensitivity to adversarial examples is tied to its spectral properties and hints at novel ways to robustify and defend against adversarial attacks. We provide extensive empirical evidence to support our theoretical results. 
10	Modern deep neural networks have a large amount of weights, which make them difficult to deploy on computation constrained devices such as mobile phones. One common approach to reduce the model size and computational cost is to use low-rank factorization to approximate a weight matrix. However, performing standard low-rank factorization with a small rank can hurt the model expressiveness and significantly decrease the performance. In this work, we propose to use a mixture of multiple low-rank factorizations to model a large weight matrix, and the mixture coefficients are computed dynamically depending on its input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both language modeling and image classification tasks. Experiments show that our method not only improves the computation efficiency but also maintains (sometimes outperforms) its accuracy compared with the full-rank counterparts.
10	Most Deep Reinforcement Learning methods perform local search andtherefore are prone to get stuck on non-optimalsolutions. Furthermore, in simulation based training, such asdomain-randomized simulation training, the availability of a simulationmodel is not exploited, which potentially decreasesefficiency. To overcome issues of local search and exploitaccess to simulation models, we propose the use of kino-dynamicplanning methods as part of a model-based reinforcement learningmethod and to learn in an off-policy fashion from solved planninginstances. We show that, even on a simple toy domain, D-RLmethods (DDPG, PPO, SAC) are not immune to local optima andrequire additional exploration mechanisms. We show that ourplanning method exhibits a better state space coverage, collectsdata that allows for better policies than D-RL methods withoutadditional exploration mechanisms and that starting from theplanner data and performing additional training results in asgood as or better policies than vanilla D-RL methods, while alsocreating data that is more fit for re-use in modified tasks.
10	We address the problem of learning fine-grained cross-modal representations. We propose an instance-based deep metric learning approach in joint visual and textual space. The key novelty of this paper is that it shows that using per-image semantic supervision leads to substantial improvement in zero-shot performance over using class-only supervision. On top of that, we provide a probabilistic justification for a metric rescaling approach that solves a very common problem in the generalized zero-shot learning setting, i.e., classifying test images from unseen classes as one of the classes seen during training. We evaluate our approach on two fine-grained zero-shot learning datasets: CUB and FLOWERS. We find that on the generalized zero-shot classification task CLAREL consistently outperforms the existing approaches on both datasets.
10	Existing graph embedding models often have weaknesses in exploiting graph structure similarities, potential dependencies among nodes and global network properties. To this end, we present U2GAN, a novel unsupervised model leveraging on the strength of the recently introduced universal self-attention network (Dehghani et al., 2019), to learn low-dimensional embeddings of graphs which can be used for graph classification. In particular, given an input graph, U2GAN first applies a self-attention computation, which is then followed by a recurrent transition to iteratively memorize its attention on vector representations of each node and its neighbors across each iteration. Thus, U2GAN can address the weaknesses in the existing models in order to produce plausible node embeddings whose sum is the final embedding of the whole graph. Experimental results show that our unsupervised U2GAN produces new state-of-the-art performances on a range of well-known benchmark datasets for the graph classification task. It even outperforms supervised methods in most of benchmark cases.
10	  In this paper, we describe a general framework to systematically analyze current neural models for multi-task learning, in which we find that existing models expect to disentangle features into different spaces while features learned in practice are still entangled in shared space,  leaving potential hazards for other training or unseen tasks. We propose to alleviate this problem by incorporating a new inductive bias into the process of multi-task learning, that different tasks can communicate with each other not only by passing hidden variables but gradients explicitly. Experimentally, we evaluate proposed methods on three groups of tasks and two types of settings (\textsc{in-task} and \textsc{out-of-task}). Quantitative and qualitative results show their effectiveness.
10	Our goal is to train a policy for autonomous driving via imitation learning that is robust enough to drive a real vehicle. We find that standard behavior cloning is insufficient for handling complex driving scenarios, even when we leverage a perception system for preprocessing the input and a controller for executing the output on the car: 30 million examples are still not enough. We propose exposing the learner to synthesized data in the form of perturbations to the expert's driving, which creates interesting situations such as collisions and/or going off the road. Rather than purely imitating all data, we augment the imitation loss with additional losses that penalize undesirable events and encourage progress -- the perturbations then provide an important signal for these losses and lead to robustness of the learned model. We show that the model can handle complex situations in simulation, and present ablation experiments that emphasize the importance of each of our proposed changes and show that the model is responding to the appropriate causal factors. Finally, we demonstrate the model driving a car in the real world ( https://sites.google.com/view/learn-to-drive ).
10	This paper propose a cumulative saliency based Globally Soft Filter Pruning (GSFP) scheme to prune redundant filters of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).Specifically, the GSFP adopts a robust pruning method, which measures the global redundancy of the filter in the whole model by using the soft pruning strategy. In addition, in the model recovery process after pruning, we use the cumulative saliency strategy to improve the accuracy of pruning. GSFP has two advantages over previous works:(1) More accurate pruning guidance. For a pre-trained CNN model, the saliency of the filter varies with different input data. Therefore, accumulating the saliency of the filter over the entire data set can provide more accurate guidance for pruning. On the other hand, pruning from a global perspective is more accurate than local pruning. (2)  More robust pruning strategy. We propose a reasonable normalization formula to prevent certain layers of filters in the network from being completely clipped due to excessive pruning rate.
10	We consider distributed online convex optimization problems, where the distributed system consists of various computing units connected through a time-varying communication graph. In each time step, each computing unit selects a constrained vector, experiences a loss equal to an arbitrary convex function evaluated at this vector, and may communicate to its neighbors in the graph. The objective is to minimize the system-wide loss accumulated over time. We propose a decentralized algorithm with regret and cumulative constraint violation in ${\cal O}(T^{\max\{c,1-c\} })$ and ${\cal O}(T^{1-c/2})$, respectively, for any $c\in (0,1)$, where $T$ is the time horizon. When the loss functions are strongly convex, we establish improved regret and constraint violation upper bounds in ${\cal O}(\log(T))$ and ${\cal O}(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$. These regret scalings match those obtained by state-of-the-art algorithms and fundamental limits in the corresponding centralized online optimization problem (for both convex and strongly convex loss functions).  In the case of bandit feedback, the proposed algorithms achieve a regret and constraint violation in ${\cal O}(T^{\max\{c,1-c/3 \} })$ and ${\cal O}(T^{1-c/2})$ for any $c\in (0,1)$. We numerically illustrate the performance of our algorithms for the particular case of distributed online regularized linear regression problems.
10	Many machine learning tasks involve analysis of set valued inputs, and thus the learned functions are expected to be permutation invariant. Recent works (e.g., Deep Sets) have sought to characterize the neural architectures which result in permutation invariance. These typically correspond to applying the same pointwise function to all set components, followed by sum aggregation. Here we take a different approach to such architectures and focus on recursive architectures such as RNNs, which are not permutation invariant in general, but can implement permutation invariant functions in a very compact manner. We  first show that commutativity and associativity of the state transition function result in permutation invariance. Next, we derive a regularizer that minimizes the degree of non-commutativity in the transitions. Finally, we demonstrate that the resulting method outperforms other methods for learning permutation invariant models, due to its use of recursive computation.
10	"In this paper, we present a general framework for distilling expectations with respect to the Bayesian posterior distribution of a deep neural network, significantly extending prior work on a method known as ``Bayesian Dark Knowledge.""  Our generalized framework applies to the case of classification models and takes as input the architecture of a ``teacher"" network, a general posterior expectation of interest, and the architecture of a ``student"" network. The distillation method performs an online compression of the selected posterior expectation using iteratively generated Monte Carlo samples from the parameter posterior of the teacher model. We further consider the problem of optimizing the student model architecture with respect to an accuracy-speed-storage trade-off. We present experimental results investigating multiple data sets, distillation targets,  teacher model architectures, and approaches to searching for student model architectures. We establish the key result that distilling into a student model with an architecture that matches the teacher, as is done in Bayesian Dark Knowledge, can lead to sub-optimal performance. Lastly, we show that student architecture search methods can identify student models with significantly improved performance. "
10	Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various fields, but they have to be scaled down to be used for real-world applications. As a means to reduce the size of a neural network while preserving its performance, knowledge transfer has brought a lot of attention. One popular method of knowledge transfer is knowledge distillation (KD), where softened outputs of a pre-trained teacher network help train student networks. Since KD, other transfer methods have been proposed, and they mainly focus on loss functions, activations of hidden layers, or additional modules to transfer knowledge well from teacher networks to student networks. In this work, we focus on the structure of a teacher network to get the effect of multiple teacher networks without additional resources. We propose changing the structure of a teacher network to have stochastic blocks and skip connections. In doing so, a teacher network becomes the aggregate of a huge number of paths. In the training phase, each sub-network is generated by dropping stochastic blocks randomly and used as a teacher network. This allows training the student network with multiple teacher networks and further enhances the student network on the same resources in a single teacher network. We verify that the proposed structure brings further improvement to student networks on benchmark datasets.
01	Adversarial learning methods have been proposed for a wide range of applications, but the training of adversarial models can be notoriously unstable. Effectively balancing the performance of the generator and discriminator is critical, since a discriminator that achieves very high accuracy will produce relatively uninformative gradients. In this work, we propose a simple and general technique to constrain information flow in the discriminator by means of an information bottleneck. By enforcing a constraint on the mutual information between the observations and the discriminator's internal representation, we can effectively modulate the discriminator's accuracy and maintain useful and informative gradients. We demonstrate that our proposed variational discriminator bottleneck (VDB) leads to significant improvements across three distinct application areas for adversarial learning algorithms. Our primary evaluation studies the applicability of the VDB to imitation learning of dynamic continuous control skills, such as running. We show that our method can learn such skills directly from raw video demonstrations, substantially outperforming prior adversarial imitation learning methods. The VDB can also be combined with adversarial inverse reinforcement learning to learn parsimonious reward functions that can be transferred and re-optimized in new settings. Finally, we demonstrate that VDB can train GANs more effectively for image generation, improving upon a number of prior stabilization methods.
10	Humans rely on episodic memory constantly, in remembering the name of someone they met 10 minutes ago, the plot of a movie as it unfolds, or where they parked the car. Endowing reinforcement learning agents with episodic memory is a key step on the path toward replicating human-like general intelligence. We analyze why standard RL agents lack episodic memory today, and why existing RL tasks don't require it. We design a new form of external memory called Masked Experience Memory, or MEM, modeled after key features of human episodic memory. To evaluate episodic memory we define an RL task based on the common children's game of Concentration. We find that a MEM RL agent leverages episodic memory effectively to master Concentration, unlike the baseline agents we tested.
01	Federated learning enables a large amount of edge computing devices to jointly learn a model without data sharing. As a leading algorithm in this setting, Federated Averaging (\texttt{FedAvg}) runs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in parallel on a small subset of the total devices and averages the sequences only once in a while. Despite its simplicity, it lacks theoretical guarantees under realistic settings. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of \texttt{FedAvg} on non-iid data and establish a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ for strongly convex and smooth problems, where $T$ is the number of SGDs. Importantly, our bound demonstrates a trade-off between communication-efficiency and convergence rate. As user devices may be disconnected from the server, we relax the assumption of full device participation to partial device participation and study different averaging schemes; low device participation rate can be achieved without severely slowing down the learning.  Our results indicate that heterogeneity of data slows down the convergence, which matches empirical observations. Furthermore, we provide a necessary condition for \texttt{FedAvg} on non-iid data: the learning rate $\eta$ must decay, even if full-gradient is used; otherwise, the solution will be $\Omega (\eta)$ away from the optimal.
01	A dynamical neural network consists of a set of interconnected neurons that interact over time continuously. It can exhibit computational properties in the sense that the dynamical system’s evolution and/or limit points in the associated state space can correspond to numerical solutions to certain mathematical optimization or learning problems. Such a computational system is particularly attractive in that it can be mapped to a massively parallel computer architecture for power and throughput efficiency, especially if each neuron can rely solely on local information (i.e., local memory). Deriving gradients from the dynamical network’s various states while conforming to this last constraint, however, is challenging. We show that by combining ideas of top-down feedback and contrastive learning, a dynamical network for solving the l1-minimizing dictionary learning problem can be constructed, and the true gradients for learning are provably computable by individual neurons. Using spiking neurons to construct our dynamical network, we present a learning process, its rigorous mathematical analysis, and numerical results on several dictionary learning problems.
01	This paper studies the expressive power of graph neural networks falling within the message-passing framework (GNNmp). Two results are presented. First, GNNmp are shown to be Turing universal under sufficient conditions on their depth, width, node attributes, and layer expressiveness. Second, it is discovered that GNNmp can lose a significant portion of their power when their depth and width is restricted. The proposed impossibility statements stem from a new technique that enables the repurposing of seminal results from distributed computing and leads to lower bounds for an array of decision, optimization, and estimation problems involving graphs. Strikingly, several of these problems are deemed impossible unless the product of a GNNmp's depth and width exceeds a polynomial of the graph size; this dependence remains significant even for tasks that appear simple or when considering approximation.
10	Modern machine learning models are often trained on examples with noisy labels that hurt performance and are hard to identify. In this paper, we provide an empirical study showing that a simple $k$-nearest neighbor-based filtering approach on the logit layer of a preliminary model can  remove mislabeled training data and produce more accurate models than some recently proposed methods. We also provide new statistical guarantees into its efficacy.
10	Network representation learning (NRL) is a powerful technique for learning low-dimensional vector representation of high-dimensional and sparse graphs. Most studies explore the structure and meta data associated with the graph using random walks and employ a unsupervised or semi-supervised learning schemes. Learning in these methods is context-free, because only a single representation per node is learned. Recently studies have argued on the sufficiency of a single representation and proposed a context-sensitive approach that proved to be highly effective in applications such as link prediction and ranking.However, most of these methods rely on additional textual features that require RNNs or CNNs to capture high-level features or rely on a community detection algorithm to identifying multiple contexts of a node.In this study, without requiring additional features nor a community detection algorithm, we propose a novel context-sensitive algorithm called GAP that learns to attend on different part of a node’s neighborhood using attentive pooling networks. We show the efficacy of GAP using three real-world datasets on link prediction and node clustering tasks and compare it against 10 popular and state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. GAP consistently outperforms them and achieves up to ≈9% and ≈20% gain over the best performing methods on link prediction and clustering tasks, respectively.
10	We study the important and challenging problem of controllable generation of long-term sequential behaviors. Solutions to this problem would impact many applications, such as calibrating behaviors of AI agents in games or predicting player trajectories in sports. In contrast to the well-studied areas of controllable generation of images, text, and speech, there are significant challenges that are unique to or exacerbated by generating long-term behaviors: how should we specify the factors of variation to control, and how can we ensure that the generated temporal behavior faithfully demonstrates diverse styles? In this paper, we leverage large amounts of raw behavioral data to learn policies that can be calibrated to generate a diverse range of behavior styles (e.g., aggressive versus passive play in sports). Inspired by recent work on leveraging programmatic labeling functions, we present a novel framework that combines imitation learning with data programming to learn style-calibratable policies. Our primary technical contribution is a formal notion of style-consistency as a learning objective, and its integration with conventional imitation learning approaches. We evaluate our framework using demonstrations from professional basketball players and agents in the MuJoCo physics environment, and show that our learned policies can be accurately calibrated to generate interesting behavior styles in both domains.
10	Manipulation and re-use of images in scientific publications is a recurring problem, at present lacking a scalable solution.  Existing tools for detecting image duplication are mostly manual or semi-automated, despite the fact that generating data for a learning-based approach is straightforward, as we here illustrate. This paper addresses the problem of determining if, given two images, one is a manipulated version of the other by means of certain geometric and statistical manipulations, e.g. copy, rotation, translation, scale, perspective transform, histogram adjustment, partial erasing, and compression artifacts. We propose a solution based on a 3-branch Siamese Convolutional Neural Network. The ConvNet model is trained to map images into a 128-dimensional space, where the Euclidean distance between duplicate (respectively, unique) images is no greater (respectively, greater) than 1. Our results suggest that such an approach can serve as tool to improve surveillance of the published and in-peer-review literature for image manipulation. We also show that as a byproduct the network learns useful representations for semantic segmentation, with performance comparable to that of domain-specific models.
10	One class anomaly detection on high-dimensional data is one of the critical issue in both fundamental machine learning research area and manufacturing applica- tions. A good anomaly detection should accurately discriminate anomalies from normal data. Although most previous anomaly detection methods achieve good performances, they do not perform well on high-dimensional imbalanced data- set 1) with a limited amount of data; 2) multi-modal distribution; 3) few anomaly data. In this paper, we develop a multi-modal one-class generative adversarial net- work based detector (MMOC-GAN) to distinguish anomalies from normal data (products). Apart from a domain-specific feature extractor, our model leverage a generative adversarial network(GAN). The generator takes in a modified noise vector using a pseudo latent prior and generate samples at the low-density area of the given normal data to simulate the anomalies. The discriminator then is trained to distinguish the generate samples from the normal samples. Since the generated samples simulate the low density area for each modal, the discriminator could directly detect anomalies from normal data. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art one-class classification models and other anomaly detection methods on both normal data and anomalies accuracy, as well as the F1 score. Also, the generated samples can fully capture the low density area of different types of products.
01	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to many recognition and learning tasks using a universal recipe;  training a deep model on a very large dataset of supervised examples. However, this approach is rather restrictive in practice since collecting a large set of labeled images is very expensive. One way to ease this problem is coming up with smart ways for choosing images to be labelled from a  very large collection (i.e. active learning).Our empirical study suggests that many of the active learning heuristics in the literature are not effective when applied to CNNs when applied in batch setting. Inspired by these limitations, we define the problem of active learning as core-set selection, i.e. choosing set of points such that a model learned over the selected subset is competitive for the remaining data points. We further present a theoretical result characterizing the performance of any selected subset using the geometry of the datapoints. As an active learning algorithm, we choose the subset which is expected to yield best result according to our characterization. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in image classification experiments by a large margin.
01	Generative models provide a way to model structure in complex distributions and have been shown to be useful for many tasks of practical interest. However, current techniques for training generative models require access to fully-observed samples. In many settings, it is expensive or even impossible to obtain fully-observed samples, but economical to obtain partial, noisy observations. We consider the task of learning an implicit generative model given only lossy measurements of samples from the distribution of interest. We show that the true underlying distribution can be provably recovered even in the presence of per-sample information loss for a class of measurement models. Based on this, we propose a new method of training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which we call AmbientGAN. On three benchmark datasets, and for various measurement models, we demonstrate substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Generative models trained with our method can obtain $2$-$4$x higher inception scores than the baselines.
10	Accompanying with the flourish development in various fields, deep neural networks, however, are still facing with the plight of high computational costs and storage. One way to compress these heavy models is knowledge transfer (KT), in which a light student network is trained through absorbing the knowledge from a powerful teacher network. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge transfer method which employs a Student-Teacher Collaboration (STC) network during the knowledge transfer process. This is done by connecting the front part of the student network to the back part of the teacher network as the STC network. The back part of the teacher network takes the intermediate representation from the front part of the student network as input to make the prediction. The difference between the prediction from the collaboration network and the output tensor from the teacher network is taken into account of the loss during the train process. Through back propagation, the teacher network provides guidance to the student network in a gradient signal manner. In this way, our method takes advantage of the knowledge from the entire teacher network, who instructs the student network in learning process. Through plentiful experiments, it is proved that our STC method outperforms other KT methods with conventional strategy.
10	Attacks on natural language models are difficult to compare due to their different definitions of what constitutes a successful attack. We present a taxonomy of constraints to categorize these attacks. For each constraint, we present a real-world use case and a way to measure how well generated samples enforce the constraint. We then employ our framework to evaluate two state-of-the art attacks which fool models with synonym substitution. These attacks claim their adversarial perturbations preserve the semantics and syntactical correctness of the inputs, but our analysis shows these constraints are not strongly enforced. For a significant portion of these adversarial examples, a grammar checker detects an increase in errors. Additionally, human studies indicate that many of these adversarial examples diverge in semantic meaning from the input or do not appear to be human-written. Finally, we highlight the need for standardized evaluation of attacks that share constraints. Without shared evaluation metrics, it is up to researchers to set thresholds that determine the trade-off between attack quality and attack success. We recommend well-designed human studies to determine the best threshold to approximate human judgement.
10	Neural networks trained through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been around for more than 30 years, but they still escape our understanding. This paper takes an experimental approach, with a divide-and-conquer strategy in mind: we start by studying what happens in single neurons. While being the core building block of deep neural networks, the way they encode information about the inputs and how such encodings emerge is still unknown. We report experiments providing strong evidence that hidden neurons behave like binary classifiers during training and testing. During training, analysis of the gradients reveals that a neuron separates two categories of inputs, which are impressively constant across training. During testing, we show that the fuzzy, binary partition described above embeds the core information used by the network for its prediction. These observations bring to light some of the core internal mechanics of deep neural networks, and have the potential to guide the next theoretical and practical developments.
10	The success of deep learning research has catapulted deep models into productionsystems that our society is becoming increasingly dependent on, especially in theimage and video domains. However, recent work has shown that these largelyuninterpretable models exhibit glaring security vulnerabilities in the presence ofan adversary. In this work, we develop a powerful untargeted adversarial attackfor action recognition systems in both white-box and black-box settings. Actionrecognition models differ from image-classification models in that their inputscontain a temporal dimension, which we explicitly target in the attack. Drawinginspiration from image classifier attacks, we create new attacks which achievestate-of-the-art success rates on a two-stream classifier trained on the UCF-101dataset. We find that our attacks can significantly degrade a model’s performancewith sparsely and imperceptibly perturbed examples. We also demonstrate thetransferability of our attacks to black-box action recognition systems.
10	Data-parallel neural network training is network-intensive, so gradient dropping was designed to exchange only large gradients.  However, gradient dropping has been shown to slow convergence.  We propose to improve convergence by having each node combine its locally computed gradient with the sparse global gradient exchanged over the network. We empirically confirm with machine translation tasks that gradient dropping with local gradients approaches convergence 48% faster than non-compressed multi-node training and 28% faster compared to vanilla gradient dropping. We also show that gradient dropping with a local gradient update does not reduce the model's final quality.
10	Auto-Encoders are unsupervised models that aim to learn  patterns from observed data by minimizing a reconstruction cost. The useful representations learned are often found to be sparse and distributed. On the other hand, compressed sensing and sparse coding assume a data generating process, where the observed data is generated from some true latent signal source, and try to recover the corresponding signal from measurements. Looking at auto-encoders from this signal recovery perspective enables us to have a more coherent view of these techniques. In this paper, in particular, we show that the true hidden representation can be approximately recovered if the weight matrices are highly incoherent with unit $ \ell^{2} $ row length and the bias vectors takes the value (approximately) equal to the negative of the data mean. The recovery also becomes more and more accurate as the sparsity in hidden signals increases. Additionally, we empirically also demonstrate that auto-encoders are capable of recovering the data generating dictionary when only data samples are given.
10	Being able to automatically discover synonymous entities from a large free-text corpus has transformative effects on structured knowledge discovery. Existing works either require structured annotations, or fail to incorporate context information effectively, which lower the efficiency of information usage. In this paper, we propose a framework for synonym discovery from free-text corpus without structured annotation. As one of the key components in synonym discovery, we introduce a novel neural network model SynonymNet to determine whether or not two given entities are synonym with each other. Instead of using entities features, SynonymNet makes use of multiple pieces of contexts in which the entity is mentioned, and compares the context-level similarity via a bilateral matching schema to determine synonymity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on both generic and domain-specific synonym datasets: Wiki+Freebase, PubMed+UMLS and MedBook+MKG, with up to 4.16% improvement in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) and 3.19% in terms of Mean Average Precision (MAP) compare to the best baseline method.
10	The exposure bias problem refers to the training-inference discrepancy caused by teacher forcing in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) training for auto-regressive neural network language models (LM). It has been regarded as a central problem for natural language generation (NLG) model training. Although a lot of algorithms have been proposed to avoid teacher forcing and therefore to alleviate exposure bias, there is little work showing how serious the exposure bias problem is. In this work, we first identify the auto-recovery ability of MLE-trained LM, which casts doubt on the seriousness of exposure bias. We then develop a precise, quantifiable definition for exposure bias. However, according to our measurements in controlled experiments, there's only around 3% performance gain when the training-inference discrepancy is completely removed. Our results suggest the exposure bias problem could be much less serious than it is currently assumed to be.
01	Many real world tasks exhibit rich structure that is repeated across different parts of the state space or in time. In this work we study the possibility of leveraging such repeated structure to speed up and regularize learning. We start from the KL regularized expected reward objective which introduces an additional component, a default policy. Instead of relying on a fixed default policy, we learn it from data. But crucially, we restrict the amount of information the default policy receives, forcing it to learn reusable behaviors that help the policy learn faster. We formalize this strategy and discuss connections to information bottleneck approaches and to the variational EM algorithm. We present empirical results in both discrete and continuous action domains and demonstrate that, for certain tasks, learning a default policy alongside the policy can significantly speed up and improve learning.Please watch the video demonstrating learned experts and default policies on several continuous control tasks ( https://youtu.be/U2qA3llzus8 ).
10	Automatic classification of objects is one of the most important tasks in engineeringand data mining applications. Although using more complex and advancedclassifiers can help to improve the accuracy of classification systems, it can bedone by analyzing data sets and their features for a particular problem. Featurecombination is the one which can improve the quality of the features. In this paper,a structure similar to Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) is used to generate anoptimized linear or non-linear combination of features for classification. GeneticAlgorithm (GA) is applied to update weights and biases. Since nature of data setsand their features impact on the effectiveness of combination and classificationsystem, linear and non-linear activation functions (or transfer function) are usedto achieve more reliable system. Experiments of several UCI data sets and usingminimum distance classifier as a simple classifier indicate that proposed linear andnon-linear intelligent FFNN-based feature combination can present more reliableand promising results. By using such a feature combination method, there is noneed to use more powerful and complex classifier anymore.
10	Over the past decade, knowledge graphs became popular for capturing structured domain knowledge. Relational learning models enable the prediction of missing links inside knowledge graphs. More specifically, latent distance approaches model the relationships among entities via a distance between latent representations.Translating embedding models (e.g., TransE) are among the most popular latent distance approaches which use one distance function to learn multiple relation patterns. However, they are mostly inefficient in capturing symmetric relations since the representation vector norm for all the symmetric relations becomes equal to zero. They also lose information when learning relations with reflexive patterns since they become symmetric and transitive.We propose the Multiple Distance Embedding model (MDE) that addresses these limitations and a framework which enables collaborative combinations of latent distance-based terms (MDE).Our solution is based on two principles: 1) using limit-based loss instead of margin ranking loss and 2) by learning independent embedding vectors for each of terms we can collectively train and predict using contradicting distance terms.We further demonstrate that MDE allows modeling relations with (anti)symmetry, inversion, and composition patterns. We propose MDE as a neural network model which allows us to map non-linear relations between the embedding vectors and the expected output of the score function.Our empirical results show that MDE outperforms the state-of-the-art embedding models on several benchmark datasets.
10	Initial value problems, i.e. differential equations with specific, initial conditions, represent a classic problem within the field of ordinary differential equations(ODEs). While the simplest types of ODEs may have closed-form solutions, most interesting cases typically rely on iterative schemes for numerical integration such as the family of Runge-Kutta methods. They are, however, sensitive to the strategy the step size is adapted during integration, which has to be chosen by the experimenter. In this paper, we show how the design of a step size controller can be cast as a learning problem, allowing deep networks to learn to exploit structure in the initial value problem at hand in an automatic way. The key ingredients for the resulting Meta-Learning Runge-Kutta (MLRK) are the development of a good performance measure and the identification of suitable input features. Traditional approaches suggest the local error estimates as input to the controller. However, by studying the characteristics of the local error function we show that including the partial derivatives of the initial value problem is favorable. Our experiments demonstrate considerable benefits over traditional approaches. In particular, MLRK is able to mitigate sudden spikes in the local error function by a faster adaptation of the step size. More importantly, the additional information in the form of partial derivatives and function values leads to a substantial improvement in performance.

10	Multi-Label Learning task simultaneously predicting multiple labels has attracted researchers' interest for its wide application. Metric Learning crucially determines the performance of the k nearest neighbor algorithms, the most popular framework handling the multi-label problem.However, the existing advanced multiple-label metric learning suffers the inferior capacity and application restriction. We propose an extendable and end-to-end deep representation approach for metric learning on multi-label data set that is based on neural networks able to operate on feature data or directly on raw image data. We motivate the choice of our network architecture via a Bidirectional Representation learning where the label dependency is also integrated and deep convolutional networks that handle image data. In multi-label metric learning, instances with the more different labels will be dragged the more far away, but ones with identical labels will concentrate together. Our model scales linearly in the number of instances and trains deep neural networks that encode both input data and output labels, then, obtains a metric space for testing data. In a number of experiments on multi-labels tasks, we demonstrate that our approach is better than related methods based on the systematic metric and its extendability.   
10	This paper proposes a neural network for classification and regression, without the need to learn layout structures in the output space. Standard solutions such as softmax cross-entropy and mean squared error are effective but parametric, meaning that known inductive structures such as maximum margin separation and simplicity (Occam's Razor) need to be  learned for the task at hand. Instead, we propose polar prototype networks, a class of networks that explicitly states the structure, \ie the layout, of the output. The structure is defined by polar prototypes, points on the hypersphere of the output space. For classification, each class is described by a single polar prototype and they are a priori distributed with maximal separation and equal shares on the hypersphere. Classes are assigned to prototypes randomly or based on semantic priors and training becomes a matter of minimizing angular distances between examples and their class prototypes. For regression, we show that training can be performed as a polar interpolation between two prototypes, arriving at a regression with higher-dimensional outputs. From empirical analysis, we find that polar prototype networks benefit from large margin separation and semantic class structure, while only requiring a minimal amount of output dimensions. While the structure is simple, the performance is on par with (classification) or better than (regression) standard network methods. Moreover, we show that we gain the ability to perform regression and classification jointly in the same space, which is disentangled and interpretable by design.
01	Many real-world systems studied are governed by complex, nonlinear dynamics.  By modeling these dynamics, we can gain insight into how these systems work, make predictions about how they will behave, and develop strategies for controlling them. While there are many methods for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems, existing techniques face a trade off between offering interpretable descriptions and making accurate predictions.  Here, we develop a class of models that aims to achieve both simultaneously, smoothly interpolating between simple descriptions and more complex, yet also more accurate models.  Our probabilistic model achieves this multi-scale property through of a hierarchy of locally linear dynamics that jointly approximate global nonlinear dynamics. We call it the tree-structured recurrent switching linear dynamical system. To fit this model, we present a fully-Bayesian sampling procedure using Polya-Gamma data augmentation to allow for fast and conjugate Gibbs sampling.  Through a variety of synthetic and real examples, we show how these models outperform existing methods in both interpretability and predictive capability.
01	Recent improvements to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made it possible to generate realistic images in high resolution based on natural language descriptions such as image captions. Furthermore, conditional GANs allow us to control the image generation process through labels or even natural language descriptions. However, fine-grained control of the image layout, i.e. where in the image specific objects should be located, is still difficult to achieve. This is especially true for images that should contain multiple distinct objects at different spatial locations. We introduce a new approach which allows us to control the location of arbitrarily many objects within an image by adding an object pathway to both the generator and the discriminator. Our approach does not need a detailed semantic layout but only bounding boxes and the respective labels of the desired objects are needed. The object pathway focuses solely on the individual objects and is iteratively applied at the locations specified by the bounding boxes. The global pathway focuses on the image background and the general image layout. We perform experiments on the Multi-MNIST, CLEVR, and the more complex MS-COCO data set. Our experiments show that through the use of the object pathway we can control object locations within images and can model complex scenes with multiple objects at various locations. We further show that the object pathway focuses on the individual objects and learns features relevant for these, while the global pathway focuses on global image characteristics and the image background.
10	Ubuntu dialogue corpus is the largest public available dialogue corpus to make it feasible to build end-to-enddeep neural network models directly from the conversation data. One challenge of Ubuntu dialogue corpus is the large number of out-of-vocabulary words. In this paper we proposed an algorithm which combines the general pre-trained word embedding vectors with those  generated on the task-specific training set to address this issue.  We integrated character embedding into Chen et al's Enhanced LSTM method (ESIM) and used it to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For the task of next utterance selection, the proposed method has demonstrated a significant performance improvement against original ESIM and the new model has achieved state-of-the-art results on both Ubuntu dialogue corpus and Douban conversation corpus. In addition, we investigated the performance impact of end-of-utterance and end-of-turn token tags. 
10	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are very popular in many fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, to name a few. Though deep learning leads to groundbreaking performance in these domains, the networks used are very demanding computationally and are far from real-time even on a GPU, which is not power efficient and therefore does not suit low power systems such as mobile devices. To overcome this challenge, some solutions have been proposed for quantizing the weights and activations of these networks, which accelerate the runtime significantly. Yet, this acceleration comes at the cost of a larger error. The NICE method proposed in this work trains quantized neural networks by noise injection and a learned clamping, which improve the accuracy. This leads to state-of-the-art results on various regression and classification tasks, e.g., ImageNet classification with architectures such as ResNet-18/34/50 with low as 3-bit weights and 3 -bit activations. We implement the proposed solution on an FPGA to demonstrate its applicability for low power real-time applications.
10	"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can achieve state-of-the-art sample quality in generative modelling tasks but suffer from the mode collapse problem. Variational Autoencoders (VAE) on the other hand explicitly maximize a reconstruction-based data log-likelihood forcing it to cover all modes, but suffer from poorer sample quality. Recent works have proposed hybrid VAE-GAN frameworks which integrate a GAN-based synthetic likelihood to the VAE objective to address both the mode collapse and sample quality issues, with limited success. This is because the VAE objective forces a trade-off between the data log-likelihood and divergence to the latent prior. The synthetic likelihood ratio term also shows instability during training. We propose a novel objective with a ``""Best-of-Many-Samples"" reconstruction cost and a stable direct estimate of the synthetic likelihood. This enables our hybrid VAE-GAN framework to achieve high data log-likelihood and low divergence to the latent prior at the same time and shows significant improvement over both hybrid VAE-GANS and plain GANs in mode coverage and quality."
10	Consider a set of latent factors whose observable effect of activation is caught on a measure space that appears as a grid of bits tacking value in {0,1}. This paper intend to deliver a theoretical and practical answer to the question: Given that we have access to a perfect indicator of the activation of latent factors that label a finite dataset of grid's activity, can we imagine a procedure to build a generic identificator of factor's activations ?
10	We derive a new intrinsic social motivation for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), in which agents are rewarded for having causal influence over another agent's actions, where causal influence is assessed using counterfactual reasoning. The reward does not depend on observing another agent's reward function, and is thus a more realistic approach to MARL than taken in previous work. We show that the causal influence reward is related to maximizing the mutual information between agents' actions. We test the approach in challenging social dilemma environments, where it consistently leads to enhanced cooperation between agents and higher collective reward. Moreover, we find that rewarding influence can lead agents to develop emergent communication protocols. Therefore, we also employ influence to train agents to use an explicit communication channel, and find that it leads to more effective communication and higher collective reward. Finally, we show that influence can be computed by equipping each agent with an internal model that predicts the actions of other agents. This allows the social influence reward to be computed without the use of a centralised controller, and as such represents a significantly more general and scalable inductive bias for MARL with independent agents.
01	Normalization layers are a staple in state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures. They are widely believed to stabilize training, enable higher learning rate, accelerate convergence and improve generalization, though the reason for their effectiveness is still an active research topic. In this work, we challenge the commonly-held beliefs by showing that none of the perceived benefits is unique to normalization. Specifically, we propose fixed-update initialization (Fixup), an initialization motivated by solving the exploding and vanishing gradient problem at the beginning of training via properly rescaling a standard initialization. We find training residual networks with Fixup to be as stable as training with normalization -- even for networks with 10,000 layers. Furthermore, with proper regularization, Fixup enables residual networks without normalization to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification and machine translation.
10	Bayesian optimization is an effective tool to optimize black-box functions and popular for hyper-parameter tuning in machine learning. Traditional Bayesian optimization methods are based on Gaussian process (GP), relying on a GP-based surrogate model for sampling points of  the function of interest.  In this work, we consider transferring knowledge from related problems to target problem by learning an initial surrogate model for warm-starting Bayesian optimization. We propose a neural network-based surrogate model to estimate the function mean value in GP.  Then we design a novel weighted Reptile algorithm with sampling strategy to learn an initial surrogate model from meta train set. The initial surrogate model is learned to be able to well adapt to new tasks. Extensive experiments show that this warm-starting technique enables us to find better minimizer or hyper-parameters than traditional GP and previous warm-starting methods.
10	While current machine learning models have achieved great success with labeled data, we have to deal with classes that have little or no training data in many real-world applications. This leads to the study of zero-shot learning. The typical approach in zero-shot learning is to embed seen and unseen classes into a shared space using class meta-data, and construct classifiers on top of that. Yet previous methods either still require significant manual labor in obtaining useful meta-data, or utilize automatically collected meta-data while trading in performance. To achieve satisfactory performance under practical meta-data efficiency constraint, we propose \textbf{N\textsuperscript{3}} (\textbf{N}eural \textbf{N}etworks from \textbf{N}atural Language), a meta-model that maps natural language class descriptions to corresponding neural network classifiers. N\textsuperscript{3} leverages readily available online documents combined with pretrained language representations such as BERT to obtain expressive class embeddings. In addition, N\textsuperscript{3} generates parameter adaptations for pretrained neural networks using these class embeddings, effectively ``finetuneing'' the network to classify unseen classes. Our experiments show that N\textsuperscript{3} is able to outperform previous methods across 8 different benchmark evaluations and we show through ablation studies the contribution of each model component. To offer insight into how N\textsuperscript{3} ``finetunes'' the pretrained network, we also performed a range of qualitative and quantitative analysis. Our code will be released after the review period.
10	Entailment vectors are a principled way to encode in a vector what information is known and what is unknown.  They are designed to model relations where one vector should include all the information in another vector, called entailment.  This paper investigates the unsupervised learning of entailment vectors for the semantics of words.  Using simple entailment-based models of the semantics of words in text (distributional semantics), we induce entailment-vector word embeddings which outperform the best previous results for predicting entailment between words, in unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on hyponymy.
10	In recent years we have witnessed tremendous progress in unpaired image-to-image translation methods, propelled by the emergence of DNNs and adversarial training strategies. However, most existing methods focus on transfer of style and appearance, rather than on shape translation. The latter task is challenging, due to its intricate non-local nature, which calls for additional supervision. We mitigate this by descending the deep layers of a pre-trained network, where the deep features contain more semantics, and applying the translation between these deep features. Specifically, we leverage VGG, which is a classification network, pre-trained with large-scale semantic supervision. Our translation is performed in a cascaded, deep-to-shallow, fashion, along the deep feature hierarchy: we first translate between the deepest layers that encode the higher-level semantic content of the image, proceeding to translate the shallower layers, conditioned on the deeper ones. We show that our method is able to translate between different domains, which exhibit significantly different shapes. We evaluate our method both qualitatively and quantitatively and compare it to state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods. Our code and trained models will be made available.
10	Generative networks are known to be difficult to assess. Recent works on generative models, especially on generative adversarial networks, produce nice samples of varied categories of images. But the validation of their quality is highly dependent on the method used. A good generator should generate data which contain meaningful and varied information and that fit the distribution of a dataset. This paper presents a new method to assess a generator. Our approach is based on training a classifier with a mixture of real and generated samples. We train a generative model over a labeled training set, then we use this generative model to sample new data points that we mix with the original training data. This mixture of real and generated data is thus used to train a classifier which is afterwards tested on a given labeled test dataset. We compare this result with the score of the same classifier trained on the real training data mixed with noise. By computing the classifier's accuracy with different ratios of samples from both distributions (real and generated) we are able to estimate if the generator successfully fits and is able to generalize the distribution of the dataset. Our experiments compare the result of different generators from the VAE and GAN framework on MNIST and fashion MNIST dataset.
10	With the growing attention on learning-to-learn new tasks using only a few examples, meta-learning has been widely used in numerous problems such as few-shot classification, reinforcement learning, and domain generalization. However, meta-learning models are prone to overfitting when there are no sufficient training tasks for the meta-learners to generalize. Although existing approaches such as Dropout are widely used to address the overfitting problem, these methods are typically designed for regularizing models of a single task in supervised training. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective method to alleviate the risk of overfitting for gradient-based meta-learning. Specifically, during the gradient-based adaptation stage, we randomly drop the gradient in the inner-loop optimization of each parameter in deep neural networks, such that the augmented gradients improve generalization to new tasks. We present a general form of the proposed gradient dropout regularization and show that this term can be sampled from either the Bernoulli or Gaussian distribution. To validate the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments and analysis on numerous tasks, demonstrating that the gradient dropout regularization mitigates the overfitting problem and improves the performance upon various gradient-based meta-learning frameworks.
10	Adversarial attacks on neural networks perturb the input at test time in order to fool trained and deployed neural network models. Most attacks such as gradient-based Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by Goodfellow et al. 2015 and DeepFool by Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. 2016 are input-dependent, small, pixel-wise perturbations, and they give different attack directions for different inputs. On the other hand, universal adversarial attacks are input-agnostic and the same attack works for most inputs. Translation or rotation-equivariant neural network models provide one approach to prevent universal attacks based on simple geometric transformations. In this paper, we observe an interesting spectral property shared by all of the above input-dependent, pixel-wise adversarial attacks on translation and rotation-equivariant networks. We exploit this property to get a single universal attack direction that fools the model on most inputs. Moreover, we show how to compute this universal attack direction using principal components of the existing input-dependent attacks on a very small sample of test inputs. We complement our empirical results by a theoretical justification, using matrix concentration inequalities and spectral perturbation bounds. We also empirically observe that the top few principal adversarial attack directions are nearly orthogonal to the top few principal invariant directions.
01	Pairwise Choice Markov Chains (PCMC) have been recently introduced to overcome limitations of choice models based on traditional axioms unable to express empirical observations from modern behavior economics like context effects occurring when a choice between two options is altered by adding a third alternative. The inference approach that estimates the transition rates between each possible pair of alternatives via maximum likelihood suffers when the examples of each alternative are scarce and is inappropriate when new alternatives can be observed at test time. In this work, we propose an amortized inference approach for PCMC by embedding its definition into a neural network that represents transition rates as a function of the alternatives' and individual's features. We apply our construction to the complex case of airline itinerary booking where singletons are common (due to varying prices and individual-specific itineraries), and context effects and behaviors strongly dependent on market segments are observed. Experiments show our network significantly outperforming, in terms of prediction accuracy and logarithmic loss, feature engineered standard and latent class Multinomial Logit models as well as recent machine learning approaches.
01	With the recent success and popularity of pre-trained language models (LMs) in natural language processing, there has been a rise in efforts to understand their inner workings. In line with such interest, we propose a novel method that assists us in investigating the extent to which pre-trained LMs capture the syntactic notion of constituency. Our method provides an effective way of extracting constituency trees from the pre-trained LMs without training. In addition, we report intriguing findings in the induced trees, including the fact that pre-trained LMs outperform other approaches in correctly demarcating adverb phrases in sentences.
10	The ability to transfer knowledge to novel environments and tasks is a sensible desiderata for general learning agents. Despite the apparent promises, transfer in RL is still an open and little exploited research area. In this paper, we take a brand-new perspective about transfer: we suggest that the ability to assign credit unveils structural invariants in the tasks that can be transferred to make RL more sample efficient. Our main contribution is Secret, a novel approach to transfer learning for RL that uses a backward-view credit assignment mechanism based on a self-attentive architecture. Two aspects are key to its generality: it learns to assign credit as a separate offline supervised process and exclusively modifies the reward function. Consequently, it can be supplemented by transfer methods that do not modify the reward function and it can be plugged on top of any RL algorithm.
01	Deep autoregressive models have shown state-of-the-art performance in density estimation for natural images on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet.  However, such models require many thousands of gradient-based weight updates and unique image examples for training. Ideally, the models would rapidly learn visual concepts from only a handful of examples, similar to the manner in which humans learns across many vision tasks.  In this paper, we show how 1) neural attention and 2) meta learning techniques can be used in combination with autoregressive models to enable effective few-shot density estimation. Our proposed modifications to PixelCNN result in state-of-the art few-shot density estimation on the Omniglot dataset.  Furthermore, we visualize the learned attention policy and find that it learns intuitive algorithms for simple tasks such as image mirroring on ImageNet and handwriting on Omniglot without supervision. Finally, we extend the model to natural images and demonstrate few-shot image generation on the Stanford Online Products dataset.
10	Learning control policies in robotic tasks requires a large number of interactions due to small learning rates, bounds on the updates or unknown constraints. In contrast humans can infer protective and safe solutions after a single failure or unexpected observation. In order to reach similar performance, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm that replicates the cognitive inference and memorization process for avoiding failures in motor control tasks. A Gaussian Process implements the modeling and the sampling of the acquisition function. This enables rapid learning with large learning rates while a mental replay phase ensures that policy regions that led to failures are inhibited during the sampling process.    The features of the hierarchical Bayesian optimization method are evaluated in a simulated and physiological humanoid postural balancing task. We quantitatively compare the human learning performance to our learning approach by evaluating the deviations of the center of mass during training. Our results show that we can reproduce the efficient learning of human subjects in postural control tasks which provides a testable model for future physiological motor control tasks. In these postural control tasks, our method outperforms standard Bayesian Optimization in the number of interactions to solve the task, in the computational demands and in the frequency of observed failures. 
01	"We explore the concept of co-design in the context of neural network verification. Specifically, we aim to train deep neural networks that not only are robust to adversarial perturbations but also whose robustness can be verified more easily. To this end, we identify two properties of network models - weight sparsity and so-called ReLU stability - that turn out to significantly impact the complexity of the corresponding verification task. We demonstrate that improving weight sparsity alone already enables us to turn computationally intractable verification problems into tractable ones. Then, improving ReLU stability leads to an additional 4-13x speedup in verification times. An important feature of our methodology is its ""universality,"" in the sense that it can be used with a broad range of training procedures and verification approaches."
10	We study the problem of multiset prediction. The goal of multiset prediction is to train a predictor that maps an input to a multiset consisting of multiple items. Unlike existing problems in supervised learning, such as classification, ranking and sequence generation, there is no known order among items in a target multiset, and each item in the multiset may appear more than once, making this problem extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel multiset loss function by viewing this problem from the perspective of sequential decision making. The proposed multiset loss function is empirically evaluated on two families of datasets, one synthetic and the other real, with varying levels of difficulty, against various baseline loss functions including reinforcement learning, sequence, and aggregated distribution matching loss functions. The experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed loss function over the others.
10	From a simplified analysis of adaptive methods, we derive AvaGrad, a new optimizer which outperforms SGD on vision tasks when its adaptability is properly tuned. We observe that the power of our method is partially explained by a decoupling of learning rate and adaptability, greatly simplifying hyperparameter search. In light of this observation, we demonstrate that, against conventional wisdom, Adam can also outperform SGD on vision tasks, as long as the coupling between its learning rate and adaptability is taken into account. In practice, AvaGrad matches the best results, as measured by generalization accuracy, delivered by any existing optimizer (SGD or adaptive) across image classification (CIFAR, ImageNet) and character-level language modelling (Penn Treebank) tasks. This later observation, alongside of AvaGrad's decoupling of hyperparameters, could make it the preferred optimizer for deep learning, replacing both SGD and Adam.
01	When mastering a complex manipulation task, humans often decompose the task into sub-skills of their body parts, practice the sub-skills independently, and then execute the sub-skills together. Similarly, a robot with multiple end-effectors can perform complex tasks by coordinating sub-skills of each end-effector. To realize temporal and behavioral coordination of skills, we propose a modular framework that first individually trains sub-skills of each end-effector with skill behavior diversification, and then learns to coordinate end-effectors using diverse behaviors of the skills. We demonstrate that our proposed framework is able to efficiently coordinate skills to solve challenging collaborative control tasks such as picking up a long bar, placing a block inside a container while pushing the container with two robot arms, and pushing a box with two ant agents.

10	Generative Adversarial Networks have been shown to be powerful tools for generating content resulting in them being intensively studied in recent years. Training these networks requires maximizing a generator loss and minimizing a discriminator loss, leading to a difficult saddle point problem that is slow and difficult to converge. Motivated by techniques in the registration of point clouds and the fluid flow formulation of mass transport, we investigate a new formulation that is based on strict minimization, without the need for the maximization. This formulation views the problem as a matching problem rather than an adversarial one, and thus allows us to quickly converge and obtain meaningful metrics in the optimization path.
10	Training generative adversarial networks is unstable in high-dimensions as the true data distribution tends to be concentrated in a small fraction of the ambient space. The discriminator is then quickly able to classify nearly all generated samples as fake, leaving the generator without meaningful gradients and causing it to deteriorate after a point in training. In this work, we propose training a single generator simultaneously against an array of discriminators, each of which looks at a different random low-dimensional projection of the data. Individual discriminators, now provided with restricted views of the input, are unable to reject generated samples perfectly and continue to provide meaningful gradients to the generator throughout training.  Meanwhile, the generator learns to produce samples consistent with the full data distribution to satisfy all discriminators simultaneously. We  demonstrate the practical utility of this approach experimentally, and show that it is able to produce image samples with higher quality than traditional training with a single discriminator.
01	"	In this paper, we propose the Asynchronous Accelerated Nonuniform Randomized Block Coordinate Descent algorithm (A2BCD). We prove A2BCD converges linearly to a solution of the convex minimization problem at the same rate as NU_ACDM, so long as the maximum delay is not too large. This is the first asynchronous Nesterov-accelerated algorithm that attains any provable speedup. Moreover, we then prove that these algorithms both have optimal complexity. Asynchronous algorithms complete much faster iterations, and A2BCD has optimal complexity. Hence we observe in experiments that A2BCD is the top-performing coordinate descent algorithm, converging up to 4-5x faster than NU_ACDM on some data sets in terms of wall-clock time. To motivate our theory and proof techniques, we also derive and analyze a continuous-time analog of our algorithm and prove it converges at the same rate."
01	Generative adversarial networks are a learning framework that rely on training a discriminator to estimate a measure of difference between a target and generated distributions. GANs, as normally formulated, rely on the generated samples being completely differentiable w.r.t. the generative parameters, and thus do not work for discrete data. We introduce a method for training GANs with discrete data that uses the estimated difference measure from the discriminator to compute importance weights for generated samples, thus providing a policy gradient for training the generator. The importance weights have a strong connection to the decision boundary of the discriminator, and we call our method boundary-seeking GANs (BGANs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with discrete image and character-based natural language generation.  In addition, the boundary-seeking objective extends to continuous data, which can be used to improve stability of training, and we demonstrate this on Celeba, Large-scale Scene Understanding (LSUN) bedrooms, and Imagenet without conditioning.
01	Likelihood-based generative models are a promising resource to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs which could compromise the robustness or reliability of a machine learning system. However, likelihoods derived from such models have been shown to be problematic for detecting certain types of inputs that significantly differ from training data. In this paper, we pose that this problem is due to the excessive influence that input complexity has in generative models' likelihoods. We report a set of experiments supporting this hypothesis, and use an estimate of input complexity to derive an efficient and parameter-free OOD score, which can be seen as a likelihood-ratio, akin to Bayesian model comparison. We find such score to perform comparably to, or even better than, existing OOD detection approaches under a wide range of data sets, models, model sizes, and complexity estimates.
10	Reliable measures of statistical dependence could potentially be useful tools for learning independent features and performing tasks like source separation using Independent Component Analysis (ICA).  Unfortunately, many of such measures, like the mutual information, are hard to estimate and optimize directly.  We propose to learn independent features with adversarial objectives (Goodfellow et al. 2014, Arjovsky et al. 2017) which optimize such measures implicitly.  These objectives compare samples from the joint distribution and the product of the marginals without the need to compute any probability densities. We also propose two methods for obtaining samples from the product of the marginals using either a simple resampling trick or a separate parametric distribution.  Our experiments show that this strategy can easily be applied to different types of model architectures and solve both linear and non-linear ICA problems.
10	This paper provides theoretical analysis of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explain its advantages over other standard methods of learning probability measures. GANs learn a probability through observations, using the objective function with a generator and a discriminator. While many empirical results indicate that GANs can generate realistic samples, the reason for such successful performance remains unelucidated. This paper focuses the situation where the target probability measure satisfies the disconnected support property, which means a separate support of a probability, and relates it with the advantage of GANs.  It is theoretically shown that, unlike other popular models, GANs do not suffer from the decrease of generalization performance caused by the disconnected support property.  We rigorously quantify the generalization performance of GANs of a given architecture, and compare it with the performance of the other models. Based on the theory, we also provide a guideline for selecting deep network architecture for GANs.  We demonstrate some numerical examples which support our results.
01	In this paper, the preparation of a neural network for pruning and few-bit quantization is formulated as a variational inference problem. To this end, a quantizing prior that leads to a multi-modal, sparse posterior distribution over weights, is introduced and a differentiable Kullback-Leibler divergence approximation for this prior is derived. After training with Variational Network Quantization, weights can be replaced by deterministic quantization values with small to negligible loss of task accuracy (including pruning by setting weights to 0). The method does not require fine-tuning after quantization. Results are shown for ternary quantization on LeNet-5 (MNIST) and DenseNet (CIFAR-10).
01	Invariant and equivariant networks have been successfully used for learning images, sets, point clouds, and graphs. A basic challenge in developing such networks is finding the maximal collection of invariant and equivariant \emph{linear} layers. Although this question is answered for the first three examples (for popular transformations, at-least), a full characterization of invariant and equivariant linear layers for graphs is not known. In this paper we provide a characterization of all permutation invariant and equivariant linear layers for (hyper-)graph data, and show that their dimension, in case of edge-value graph data, is $2$ and $15$, respectively. More generally, for graph data defined on $k$-tuples of nodes, the dimension is the $k$-th and $2k$-th Bell numbers. Orthogonal bases for the layers are computed, including generalization to multi-graph data. The constant number of basis elements and their characteristics allow successfully applying the networks to different size graphs. From the theoretical point of view, our results generalize and unify recent advancement in equivariant deep learning. In particular, we show that our model is capable of approximating any message passing neural network.Applying these new linear layers in a simple deep neural network framework is shown to achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art and to have better expressivity than previous invariant and equivariant bases.
10	"Deep neural networks, which gain great success in a wide spectrum of applications, are often time, compute and storage hungry. Curriculum learning proposed to boost training of network by a syllabus from easy to hard. However, the relationship between data complexity and network training is unclear: why hard example harm the performance at beginning but helps at end. In this paper, we aim to investigate on this problem. Similar to internal covariate shift in network forward pass, the distribution changes in weight of top layers also affects training of preceding layers during the backward pass. We call this phenomenon inverse ""internal covariate shift"". Training hard examples aggravates the distribution shifting and damages the training. To address this problem, we introduce a curriculum loss that consists of two parts: a) an adaptive weight that mitigates large early punishment; b) an additional representation loss for low weighted samples. The intuition of the loss is very simple. We train top layers on ""good"" samples to reduce large shifting, and encourage ""bad"" samples to learn from ""good"" sample. In detail, the adaptive weight assigns small values to hard examples, reducing the influence of noisy gradients. On the other hand, the less-weighted hard sample receives the proposed representation loss. Low-weighted data gets nearly no training signal and can stuck in embedding space for a long time. The proposed representation loss aims to encourage their training. This is done by letting them learn a better representation from its superior neighbours but not participate in learning of top layers. In this way, the fluctuation of top layers is reduced and hard samples also received signals for training. We found in this paper that curriculum learning needs random sampling between tasks for better training. Our curriculum loss is easy to combine with existing stochastic algorithms like SGD. Experimental result shows an consistent improvement over several benchmark datasets."
10	Learning at small or large scales of data is addressed by two strong but divided frontiers: few-shot learning and standard supervised learning. Few-shot learning focuses on sample efficiency at small scale, while supervised learning focuses on accuracy at large scale. Ideally they could be reconciled for effective learning at any number of data points (shot) and number of classes (way). To span the full spectrum of shot and way, we frame the variadic learning regime of learning from any number of inputs. We approach variadic learning by meta-learning a novel multi-modal clustering model that connects bayesian nonparametrics and deep metric learning. Our bayesian nonparametric deep embedding (BANDE) method is optimized end-to-end with a single objective, and adaptively adjusts capacity to learn from variable amounts of supervision. We show that multi-modality is critical for learning complex classes such as Omniglot alphabets and carrying out unsupervised clustering. We explore variadic learning by measuring generalization across shot and way between meta-train and meta-test, show the first results for scaling from few-way, few-shot tasks to 1692-way Omniglot classification and 5k-shot CIFAR-10 classification, and find that nonparametric methods generalize better than parametric methods. On the standard few-shot learning benchmarks of Omniglot and mini-ImageNet, BANDE equals or improves on the state-of-the-art for semi-supervised classification.
10	Adversarial examples are modified samples that preserve original image structures but deviate classifiers. Researchers have put efforts into developing methods for generating adversarial examples and finding out origins. Past research put much attention on decision boundary changes caused by these methods. This paper, in contrast, discusses the origin of adversarial examples from a more underlying knowledge representation point of view. Human beings can learn and classify prototypes as well as transformations of objects. While neural networks store learned knowledge in a more hybrid way of combining all prototypes and transformations as a whole distribution. Hybrid storage may lead to lower distances between different classes so that small modifications can mislead the classifier. A one-step distribution imitation method is designed to imitate distribution of the nearest different class neighbor. Experiments show that simply by imitating distributions from a training set without any knowledge of the classifier can still lead to obvious impacts on classification results from deep networks. It also implies that adversarial examples can be in more forms than small perturbations. Potential ways of alleviating adversarial examples are discussed from the representation point of view. The first path is to change the encoding of data sent to the training step. Training data that are more prototypical can help seize more robust and accurate structural knowledge. The second path requires constructing learning frameworks with improved representations.
10	The uncertainty estimation is critical in real-world decision making applications, especially when distributional shift between the training and test data are prevalent. Many calibration methods in the literature have been proposed to improve the predictive uncertainty of DNNs which are generally not well-calibrated. However, none of them is specifically designed to work properly under domain shift condition. In this paper, we propose Unsupervised Temperature Scaling (UTS) as a robust calibration method to domain shift. It exploits test samples to adjust the uncertainty prediction of deep models towards the test distribution.  UTS utilizes a novel loss function, weighted NLL, that allows unsupervised calibration.  We evaluate UTS on a wide range of model-datasets which shows the possibility of calibration without labels and demonstrate the robustness of UTS compared to other methods (e.g., TS, MC-dropout, SVI, ensembles) in shifted domains.  
01	Most research on lifelong learning applies to images or games, but not language.We present LAMOL, a simple yet effective method for lifelong language learning (LLL) based on language modeling.LAMOL replays pseudo-samples of previous tasks while requiring no extra memory or model capacity.Specifically, LAMOL is a language model that simultaneously learns to solve the tasks and generate training samples.When the model is trained for a new task, it generates pseudo-samples of previous tasks for training alongside data for the new task.The results show that LAMOL prevents catastrophic forgetting without any sign of intransigence and can perform five very different language tasks sequentially with only one model. Overall, LAMOL outperforms previous methods by a considerable margin and is only 2-3% worse than multitasking, which is usually considered the LLL upper bound.The source code is available at https://github.com/jojotenya/LAMOL.
10	Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provides a mathematically grounded framework to quantify uncertainty. However BNNs are computationally inefficient,thus are generally not employed on complicated machine learning tasks. DeepEnsembles were introduced as a Bootstrap inspired frequentist approach to thecommunity, as an alternative to BNN’s. Ensembles of deterministic and stochastic networks are a good uncertainty estimator in various applications (Although,they are criticized for not being Bayesian). We show Ensembles of deterministicand stochastic Neural Networks can indeed be cast as an approximate Bayesianinference. Deep Ensembles have another weakness of having high space complexity, we provide an alternative to it by modifying the original Bayes by Backprop (BBB) algorithm to learn more general concrete mixture distributions overweights. We show our methods and its variants can give better uncertainty estimates at a significantly lower parametric overhead than Deep Ensembles. Wevalidate our hypothesis through experiments like non-linear regression, predictiveuncertainty estimation, detecting adversarial images and exploration-exploitationtrade-off in reinforcement learning.
10	Open-domain question answering remains a challenging task as it requires models that are capable of understanding questions and answers, collecting useful information, and reasoning over evidence. Previous work typically formulates this task as a reading comprehension or entailment problem given evidence retrieved from search engines. However, existing techniques struggle to retrieve indirectly related evidence when no directly related evidence is provided, especially for complex questions where it is hard to parse precisely what the question asks. In this paper we propose a retriever-reader model that learns to attend on essential terms during the question answering process. We build (1) an essential term selector which first identifies the most important words in a question, then reformulates the query and searches for related evidence; and (2) an enhanced reader that distinguishes between essential terms and distracting words to predict the answer. We evaluate our model on multiple open-domain QA datasets where it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art, notably leading to an improvement of 8.1% on the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) dataset.
10	Despite the eminent successes of deep neural networks, many architectures are often hard to transfer to irregularly-sampled and asynchronous time series that occur in many real-world datasets, such as healthcare applications. This paper proposes a novel framework for classifying irregularly sampled time series with unaligned measurements, focusing on high scalability and data efficiency.Our method SeFT (Set Functions for Time Series) is based on recent advances in differentiable set function learning, extremely parallelizable, and scales well to very large datasets and online monitoring scenarios.We extensively compare our method to competitors on multiple healthcare time series datasets and show that it performs competitively whilst significantly reducing runtime.
10	Deep learning applied to the reconstruction of 3D shapes has seen growing interest. A popular approach to 3D reconstruction and generation in recent years has been the CNN decoder-encoder model often applied in voxel space. However this often scales very poorly with the resolution limiting the effectiveness of these models. Several sophisticated alternatives for decoding to 3D shapes have been proposed typically relying on alternative deep learning architectures. We show however in this work that standard benchmarks in 3D reconstruction can be tackled with a surprisingly simple approach: a linear decoder obtained by principal component analysis on the signed distance transform of the surface. This approach allows easily scaling to larger resolutions. We show in multiple experiments it is competitive with state of the art methods and also allows the decoder to be fine-tuned on the target task using a loss designed for SDF transforms, obtaining further gains.    
10	Existing attention mechanisms, are mostly item-based in that a model is trained to attend to individual items in a collection (the memory) where each item has a predefined, fixed granularity, e.g., a character or a word. Intuitively, an area in the memory consisting of multiple items can be worth attending to as a whole. We propose area attention: a way to attend to an area of the memory, where each area contains a group of items that are either spatially adjacent when the memory has a 2-dimensional structure, such as images, or temporally adjacent for 1-dimensional memory, such as natural language sentences. Importantly, the size of an area, i.e., the number of items in an area or the level of aggregation, is dynamically determined via learning, which can vary depending on the learned coherence of the adjacent items. By giving the model the option to attend to an area of items, instead of only individual items, a model can attend to information with varying granularity. Area attention can work along multi-head attention for attending to multiple areas in the memory. We evaluate area attention on two tasks: neural machine translation (both character and token-level) and image captioning, and improve upon strong (state-of-the-art) baselines in all the cases. These improvements are obtainable with a basic form of area attention that is parameter free. In addition to proposing the novel concept of area attention, we contribute an efficient way for computing it by leveraging the technique of summed area tables.
10	Sequence prediction models can be learned from example sequences with a variety of training algorithms. Maximum likelihood learning is simple and efficient, yet can suffer from compounding error at test time. Reinforcement learning such as policy gradient addresses the issue but can have prohibitively poor exploration efficiency. A rich set of other algorithms, such as data noising, RAML, and softmax policy gradient, have also been developed from different perspectives. In this paper, we present a formalism of entropy regularized policy optimization, and show that the apparently distinct algorithms, including MLE, can be reformulated as special instances of the formulation. The difference between them is characterized by the reward function and two weight hyperparameters.The unifying interpretation enables us to systematically compare the algorithms side-by-side, and gain new insights into the trade-offs of the algorithm design.The new perspective also leads to an improved approach that dynamically interpolates among the family of algorithms, and learns the model in a scheduled way. Experiments on machine translation, text summarization, and game imitation learning demonstrate superiority of the proposed approach.
10	Overfitting is an ubiquitous problem in neural network training and usually mitigated using a holdout data set.Here we challenge this rationale and investigate criteria for overfitting without using a holdout data set.Specifically, we train a model for a fixed number of epochs multiple times with varying fractions of randomized labels and for a range of regularization strengths. A properly trained model should not be able to attain an accuracy greater than the fraction of properly labeled data points. Otherwise the model overfits. We introduce two criteria for detecting overfitting and one to detect underfitting. We analyze early stopping, the regularization factor, and network depth.In safety critical applications we are interested in models and parameter settings which perform well and are not likely to overfit. The methods of this paper allow characterizing and identifying such models.
10	Reinforcement learning agents can include different components, such as policies, value functions, state representations, and environment models. Any or all of these can be the loci of knowledge, i.e., structures where knowledge, whether given or learned, can be deposited and reused. Regardless of its composition, the objective of an agent is behave so as to maximise the sum of suitable scalar functions of state: the rewards. As far as the learning algorithm is concerned, these rewards are typically given and immutable. In this paper we instead consider the proposition that the reward function itself may be a good locus of knowledge. This is consistent with a common use, in the literature, of hand-designed intrinsic rewards to improve the learning dynamics of an agent. We adopt a multi-lifetime setting of the Optimal Rewards Framework, and investigate how meta-learning can be used to find good reward functions in a data-driven way. To this end, we propose to meta-learn an intrinsic reward function that allows agents to maximise their extrinsic rewards accumulated until the end of their lifetimes. This long-term lifetime objective allows our learned intrinsic reward to generate systematic multi-episode exploratory behaviour. Through proof-of-concept experiments, we elucidate interesting forms of knowledge that may be captured by a suitably trained intrinsic reward such as the usefulness of exploring uncertain states and rewards.
01	Momentum-based acceleration of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is widely used in deep learning. We propose the quasi-hyperbolic momentum algorithm (QHM) as an extremely simple alteration of momentum SGD, averaging a plain SGD step with a momentum step. We describe numerous connections to and identities with other algorithms, and we characterize the set of two-state optimization algorithms that QHM can recover. Finally, we propose a QH variant of Adam called QHAdam, and we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms lead to significantly improved training in a variety of settings, including a new state-of-the-art result on WMT16 EN-DE. We hope that these empirical results, combined with the conceptual and practical simplicity of QHM and QHAdam, will spur interest from both practitioners and researchers. Code is immediately available.
01	Representations of sets are challenging to learn because operations on sets should be permutation-invariant. To this end, we propose a Permutation-Optimisation module that learns how to permute a set end-to-end. The permuted set can be further processed to learn a permutation-invariant representation of that set, avoiding a bottleneck in traditional set models. We demonstrate our model's ability to learn permutations and set representations with either explicit or implicit supervision on four datasets, on which we achieve state-of-the-art results: number sorting, image mosaics, classification from image mosaics, and visual question answering.
10	The paper explores a novel methodology in source code obfuscation through the application of text-based recurrent neural network network (RNN) encoder-decoder models in ciphertext generation and key generation. Sequence-to-sequence modelsare incorporated into the model architecture to generate obfuscated code, generate the deobfuscation key, and live execution. Quantitative benchmark comparison to existing obfuscation methods indicate significant improvement in stealth and execution cost for the proposed solution, and experiments regarding the model’s properties yield positive results regarding its character variation, dissimilarity to the original codebase, and consistent length of obfuscated code.
10	Unordered, variable-sized inputs arise in many settings across multiple fields.  The ability for set- and multiset- oriented neural networks to handle this type of input has been the focus of much work in recent years.  We propose to represent multisets using complex-weighted multiset automata and show how the multiset representations of certain existing neural architectures can be viewed as special cases of ours.  Namely, (1) we provide a new theoretical and intuitive justification for the Transformer model's representation of positions using sinusoidal functions, and (2) we extend the DeepSets model to use complex numbers, enabling it to outperform the existing model on an extension of one of their tasks.  
10	Recent work has shown that contextualized word representations derived from neural machine translation (NMT) are a viable alternative to such from simple word predictions tasks. This is because the internal understanding that needs to be built in order to be able to translate from one language to another is much more comprehensive. Unfortunately, computational and memory limitations as of present prevent NMT models from using large word vocabularies, and thus alternatives such as subword units (BPE and morphological segmentations) and characters have been used. Here we study the impact of using different kinds of units on the quality of the resulting representations when used to model syntax, semantics, and morphology.  We found that while representations derived from subwords are slightly better for modeling syntax, character-based representations are superior for modeling morphology and are also more robust to noisy input.
10	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been impactful on many problems and applications but suffer from unstable training. Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) leverages the Wasserstein distance to avoid the caveats in the minmax two-player training of GANs but has other defects such as mode collapse and lack of metric to detect the convergence. We introduce a novel inference WGAN (iWGAN) model, which is a principled framework to fuse auto-encoders and WGANs. The iWGAN jointly learns an encoder network and a generative network using an iterative primal dual optimization process. We establish the generalization error bound of iWGANs. We further provide a rigorous probabilistic interpretation of our model under the framework of maximum likelihood estimation. The iWGAN, with a clear stopping criteria, has many advantages over other autoencoder GANs. The empirical experiments show that our model greatly mitigates the symptom of mode collapse, speeds up the convergence, and is able to provide a measurement of quality check for each individual sample. We illustrate the ability of iWGANs by obtaining a competitive and stable performance with state-of-the-art for benchmark datasets.
10	It has been argued that current machine learning models do not have commonsense, and therefore must be hard-coded with prior knowledge (Marcus, 2018). Here we show surprising evidence that language models can already learn to capture certain common sense knowledge. Our key observation is that a language model can compute the probability of any statement, and this probability can be used to evaluate the truthfulness of that statement.  On the Winograd Schema Challenge (Levesque et al., 2011), language models are 11% higher in accuracy than previous state-of-the-art supervised methods. Language models can also be fine-tuned for the task of Mining Commonsense Knowledge on ConceptNet to achieve an F1 score of 0.912 and 0.824, outperforming previous best results (Jastrzebskiet al., 2018).  Further analysis demonstrates that language models can discover unique features of Winograd Schema contexts that decide the correct answers without explicit supervision.
01	This paper concerns dictionary learning, i.e., sparse coding, a fundamental representation learning problem. We show that a subgradient descent algorithm, with random initialization, can recover orthogonal dictionaries on a natural nonsmooth, nonconvex L1 minimization formulation of the problem, under mild statistical assumption on the data. This is in contrast to previous provable methods that require either expensive computation or delicate initialization schemes. Our analysis develops several tools for characterizing landscapes of nonsmooth functions, which might be of independent interest for provable training of deep networks with nonsmooth activations (e.g., ReLU), among other applications. Preliminary synthetic and real experiments corroborate our analysis and show that our algorithm works well empirically in recovering orthogonal dictionaries.
01	Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) methods are effective for solving two-player zero-sum extensive games with imperfect information with  state-of-the-art results.  However,  the vanilla CFR has to traverse the whole game tree in each round, which is time-consuming in large-scale games. In this paper, we present Lazy-CFR, a CFR algorithm that adopts a lazy update strategy to avoid traversing the whole game tree in each round.  We prove that the regret of Lazy-CFR is almost the same to the regret of the vanilla CFR and only needs to visit a small portion of the game tree.  Thus, Lazy-CFR is provably faster than CFR. Empirical results consistently show that Lazy-CFR is significantly faster than the vanilla CFR.
10	Natural intelligent agents learn to perceive the three dimensional structure of the world without training on large datasets and are unlikely to have the precise equations of projective geometry hard-wired in the brain. Such skill would also be  valuable  to  artificial  systems  in  order  to  avoid  the  expensive  collection  of labeled datasets, as well as tedious tuning required by methods based on multi-view geometry. Inspired by natural agents, who interact with the environment via visual and haptic feedback, this paper explores a new approach to learning depth from images and very sparse depth measurements, just a few pixels per image. To learn from such extremely sparse supervision, we introduce an appropriate inductive bias by designing a specialized global-local network architecture. Experiments on several datasets show that the proposed model can learn monocular dense depth estimation when trained with very sparse ground truth, even a single pixel per image. Moreover, we find that the global parameters extracted by the network are predictive of the metric agent motion.
10	Deep learning enables training of large and flexible function approximators from scratch at the cost of large amounts of data. Applications of neural networks often consider learning in the context of a single task. However, in many scenarios what we hope to learn is not just a single task, but a model that can be used to solve multiple different tasks. Such multi-task learning settings have the potential to improve data efficiency and generalization by sharing data and representations across tasks. However, in some challenging multi-task learning settings, particularly in reinforcement learning, it is very difficult to learn a single model that can solve all the tasks while realizing data efficiency and performance benefits. Learning each of the tasks independently from scratch can actually perform better in such settings, but it does not benefit from the representation sharing that multi-task learning can potentially provide. In this work, we develop an approach that endows a single model with the ability to represent both extremes: joint training and independent training. To this end, we introduce matrix-interleaving (Mint), a modification to standard neural network models that projects the activations for each task into a different learned subspace, represented by a per-task and per-layer matrix. By learning these matrices jointly with the other model parameters, the optimizer itself can decide how much to share representations between tasks. On three challenging multi-task supervised learning and reinforcement learning problems with varying degrees of shared task structure, we find that this model consistently matches or outperforms joint training and independent training, combining the best elements of both.
10	In many reinforcement learning settings, rewards which are extrinsically available to the learning agent are too sparse to train a suitable policy. Beside reward shaping which requires human expertise, utilizing better exploration strategies helps to circumvent the problem of policy training with sparse rewards. In this work, we introduce an exploration approach based on maximizing the entropy of the visited states while learning a goal-conditioned policy. The main contribution of this work is to introduce a novel reward function which combined with a goal proposing scheme, increases the entropy of the visited states faster compared to the prior work. This improves the exploration capability of the agent, and therefore enhances the agent's chance to solve sparse reward problems more efficiently. Our empirical studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to solve different sparse reward problems in comparison to the prior work. 
10	Recent studies have shown the vulnerability of reinforcement learning (RL) models in noisy settings. The sources of noises differ across scenarios. For instance, in practice, the observed reward channel is often subject to noise (e.g., when observed rewards are collected through sensors), and thus observed rewards may not be credible as a result. Also, in applications such as robotics, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm can be manipulated to produce arbitrary errors. In this paper, we consider noisy RL problems where observed rewards by RL agents are generated with a reward confusion matrix. We call such observed rewards as perturbed rewards. We develop an unbiased reward estimator aided robust RL framework that enables RL agents to learn in noisy environments while observing only perturbed rewards. Our framework draws upon approaches for supervised learning with noisy data. The core ideas of our solution include estimating a reward confusion matrix and defining a set of unbiased surrogate rewards. We prove the convergence and sample complexity of our approach. Extensive experiments on different DRL platforms show that policies based on our estimated surrogate reward can achieve higher expected rewards, and converge faster than existing baselines. For instance, the state-of-the-art PPO algorithm is able to obtain 67.5% and 46.7% improvements in average on five Atari games, when the error rates are 10% and 30% respectively. 
01	Obtaining high-quality uncertainty estimates is essential for many applications of deep neural networks. In this paper, we theoretically justify a scheme for estimating uncertainties, based on sampling from a prior distribution. Crucially, the uncertainty estimates are shown to be conservative in the sense that they never underestimate a posterior uncertainty obtained by a hypothetical Bayesian algorithm. We also show concentration, implying that the uncertainty estimates converge to zero as we get more data. Uncertainty estimates obtained from random priors can be adapted to any deep network architecture and trained using standard supervised learning pipelines. We provide experimental evaluation of random priors on calibration and out-of-distribution detection on typical computer vision tasks, demonstrating that they outperform deep ensembles in practice.
10	Label shift refers to the phenomenon where the marginal probability p(y) of observing a particular class changes between the training and test distributions, while the conditional probability p(x|y) stays fixed. This is relevant in settings such as medical diagnosis, where a classifier trained to predict disease based on observed symptoms may need to be adapted to a different distribution where the baseline frequency of the disease is higher. Given estimates of p(y|x) from a predictive model, one can apply domain adaptation procedures including Expectation Maximization (EM) and Black-Box Shift Estimation (BBSE) to efficiently correct for the difference in class proportions between the training and test distributions. Unfortunately, modern neural networks typically fail to produce well-calibrated estimates of p(y|x), reducing the effectiveness of these approaches. In recent years, Temperature Scaling has emerged as an efficient approach to combat miscalibration. However, the effectiveness of Temperature Scaling in the context of adaptation to label shift has not been explored. In this work, we study the impact of various calibration approaches on shift estimates produced by EM or BBSE. In experiments with image classification and diabetic retinopathy detection, we find that calibration consistently tends to improve shift estimation. In particular, calibration approaches that include class-specific bias parameters are significantly better than approaches that lack class-specific bias parameters, suggesting that reducing systematic bias in the calibrated probabilities is especially important for domain adaptation.
01	It is easy for people to imagine what a man with pink hair looks like, even if they have never seen such a person before. We call the ability to create images of novel semantic concepts visually grounded imagination. In this paper, we show how we can modify variational auto-encoders to perform this task. Our method uses a novel training objective, and a novel product-of-experts inference network, which can handle partially specified (abstract) concepts in a principled and efficient way. We also propose a set of easy-to-compute evaluation metrics that capture our intuitive notions of what it means to have good visual imagination, namely correctness, coverage, and compositionality (the 3 C’s). Finally, we perform a detailed comparison of our method with two existing joint image-attribute VAE methods (the JMVAE method of Suzuki et al., 2017 and the BiVCCA method of Wang et al., 2016) by applying them to two datasets: the MNIST-with-attributes dataset (which we introduce here), and the CelebA dataset (Liu et al., 2015).
10	Learning communication via deep reinforcement learning has recently been shown to be an effective way to solve cooperative multi-agent tasks. However, learning which communicated information is beneficial for each agent's decision-making remains a challenging task. In order to address this problem, we introduce a fully differentiable framework for communication and reasoning, enabling agents to solve cooperative tasks in partially-observable environments. The framework is designed to facilitate explicit reasoning between agents, through a novel memory-based attention network that can learn selectively from its past memories. The model communicates through a series of reasoning steps that decompose each agent's intentions into learned representations that are used first to compute the relevance of communicated information, and second to extract information from memories given newly received information. By selectively interacting with new information, the model effectively learns a communication protocol directly, in an end-to-end manner. We empirically demonstrate the strength of our model in cooperative multi-agent tasks, where inter-agent communication and reasoning over prior information substantially improves performance compared to baselines.
01	Computer vision has undergone a dramatic revolution in performance, driven in large part through deep features trained on large-scale supervised datasets. However, much of these improvements have focused on static image analysis; video understanding has seen rather modest improvements. Even though new datasets and spatiotemporal models have been proposed, simple frame-by-frame classification methods often still remain competitive. We posit that current video datasets are plagued with implicit biases over scene and object structure that can dwarf variations in temporal structure. In this work, we build a video dataset with fully observable and controllable object and scene bias, and which truly requires spatiotemporal understanding in order to be solved. Our dataset, named CATER, is rendered synthetically using a library of standard 3D objects, and tests the ability to recognize compositions of object movements that require long-term reasoning. In addition to being a challenging dataset, CATER also provides a plethora of diagnostic tools to analyze modern spatiotemporal video architectures by being completely observable and controllable. Using CATER, we provide insights into some of the most recent state of the art deep video architectures.
10	Deep networks face challenges of ensuring their robustness against inputs that cannot be effectively represented by information learned from training data. We attribute this vulnerability to the limitations inherent to activation-based representation. To complement the learned information from activation-based representation, we propose utilizing a gradient-based representation that explicitly focuses on missing information. In addition, we propose a directional constraint on the gradients as an objective during training to improve the characterization of missing information. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we compare the anomaly detection performance of gradient-based and activation-based representations. We show that the gradient-based representation outperforms the activation-based representation by 0.093 in CIFAR-10 and 0.361 in CURE-TSR datasets in terms of AUROC averaged over all classes. Also, we propose an anomaly detection algorithm that uses the gradient-based representation, denoted as GradCon, and validate its performance on three benchmarking datasets. The proposed method outperforms the majority of the state-of-the-art algorithms in CIFAR-10, MNIST, and fMNIST datasets with an average AUROC of 0.664, 0.973, and 0.934, respectively.
01	"The critical locus of the loss function of a neural network is determined by the geometry of the functional space and by the parameterization of this space by the network's weights. We introduce a natural distinction between pure critical points, which only depend on the functional space, and spurious critical points, which arise from the parameterization. We apply this perspective to revisit and extend the literature on the loss function of linear neural networks. For this type of network, the functional space is either the set of all linear maps from input to output space, or a determinantal variety, i.e., a set of linear maps with bounded rank. We use geometric properties of determinantal varieties to derive new results on the landscape of linear networks with different loss functions and different parameterizations. Our analysis clearly illustrates that the absence of ""bad"" local minima in the loss landscape of linear networks is due to two distinct phenomena that apply in different settings: it is true for arbitrary smooth convex losses in the case of architectures that can express all linear maps (""filling architectures"") but it holds only for the quadratic loss when the functional space is a determinantal variety (""non-filling architectures""). Without any assumption on the architecture, smooth convex losses may lead to landscapes with many bad minima."
10	Deep graph generation models have achieved great successes recently, among which, however, are typically unconditioned generative models that have no control over the target graphs are given an input graph. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph-Translation-Generative-Adversarial-Networks (GT-GAN) that transforms the input graphs into their target output graphs. GT-GAN consists of a graph translator equipped with innovative graph convolution and deconvolution layers to learn the translation mapping considering both global and local features, and a new conditional graph discriminator to classify target graphs by conditioning on input graphs. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed GT-GAN significantly outperforms other baseline methods in terms of both effectiveness and scalability. For instance, GT-GAN achieves at least 10X and 15X faster runtimes than GraphRNN and RandomVAE, respectively, when the size of the graph is around 50.
10	Modularity is a key feature of deep learning libraries but has not been fully exploited for probabilistic programming. We propose to improve modularity of probabilistic programming language by offering not only plain probabilistic distributions but also sophisticated probabilistic model such as Bayesian non-parametric models as fundamental building blocks. We demonstrate this idea by presenting a modular probabilistic programming language MXFusion, which includes a new type of re-usable building blocks, called probabilistic modules. A probabilistic module consists of a set of random variables with associated probabilistic distributions and dedicated inference methods. Under the framework of variational inference, the pre-specified inference methods of individual probabilistic modules can be transparently used for inference of the whole probabilistic model. We demonstrate the power and convenience of probabilistic modules in MXFusion with various examples of Gaussian process models, which are evaluated with experiments on real data.
10	We introduce an new technique to learn correlations between two types of data.The learned representation can be used to directly compute the expectations of functions over one type of data conditioned on the other, such as Bayesian estimators and their standard deviations. Specifically, our loss function teaches two neural nets to extract features representing the probability vectors of highest singular value for the stochastic map (set of conditional probabilities) implied by the joint dataset, relative to the inner product defined by the Fisher information metrics evaluated at the marginals.We test the approach using a synthetic dataset, analytical calculations, and inference on occluded MNIST images. Surprisingly, when applied to supervised learning (one dataset consists of labels), this approach automatically provides regularization and faster convergence compared to the cross-entropy objective.We also explore using this approach to discover salient independent features of a single dataset. 
01	Decades of research on the neural code underlying spatial navigation have revealed a diverse set of neural response properties. The Entorhinal Cortex (EC) of the mammalian brain contains a rich set of spatial correlates, including grid cells which encode space using tessellating patterns. However, the mechanisms and functional significance of these spatial representations remain largely mysterious. As a new way to understand these neural representations, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform navigation tasks in 2D arenas based on velocity inputs. Surprisingly, we find that grid-like spatial response patterns emerge in trained networks, along with units that exhibit other spatial correlates, including border cells and band-like cells. All these different functional types of neurons have been observed experimentally. The order of the emergence of grid-like and border cells is also consistent with observations from developmental studies. Together, our results suggest that grid cells, border cells and others as observed in EC may be a natural solution for representing space efficiently given the predominant recurrent connections in the neural circuits.
01	We present Optimal Completion Distillation (OCD), a training procedure for optimizing sequence to sequence models based on edit distance. OCD is efficient, has no hyper-parameters of its own, and does not require pre-training or joint optimization with conditional log-likelihood. Given a partial sequence generated by the model, we first identify the set of optimal suffixes that minimize the total edit distance, using an efficient dynamic programming algorithm.  Then, for each position of the generated sequence, we use a target distribution which puts equal probability on the first token of all the optimal suffixes. OCD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on end-to-end speech recognition, on both Wall Street Journal and Librispeech datasets, achieving $9.3\%$ WER and $4.5\%$ WER, respectively.
01	Due to the sharp increase in the severity of the threat imposed by software vulnerabilities, the detection of vulnerabilities in binary code has become an important concern in the software industry, such as the embedded systems industry, and in the field of computer security. However, most of the work in binary code vulnerability detection has relied on handcrafted features which are manually chosen by a select few, knowledgeable domain experts. In this paper, we attempt to alleviate this severe binary vulnerability detection bottleneck by leveraging recent advances in deep learning representations and propose the Maximal Divergence Sequential Auto-Encoder. In particular, latent codes representing vulnerable and non-vulnerable binaries are encouraged to be maximally divergent, while still being able to maintain crucial information from the original binaries. We conducted extensive experiments to compare and contrast our proposed methods with the baselines, and the results show that our proposed methods outperform the baselines in all performance measures of interest.
10	Learning deep neural networks could be understood as the combination of representation learning and learning halfspaces. While most previous work aims to diversify representation learning by data augmentations and regularizations, we explore the opposite direction through the lens of empirical Bayes method. Specifically, we propose a matrix-variate normal prior whose covariance matrix has a Kronecker product structure to capture the correlations in learning different neurons through backpropagation. The prior encourages neurons to learn from the experience of others, hence it provides an effective regularization when training large networks on small datasets. To optimize the model, we design an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm with analytic solutions. Empirically, we show that the proposed method helps the network converge to better local optima that also generalize better, and we verify the effectiveness of the approach on both multiclass classification and multitask regression problems with various network structures. 
10	"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are systems that link the brain with machines using brainwaves as a medium of communication using electroencephalography to explore the brain activity which is an affordable solution, noninvasive, easy setup, and portability. However, the neural signals are noisy, non-stationary, and nonlinear where the processing of those signals in a pattern recognition problem needs a complex pipeline of preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms that need an apriori knowledge to avoid compatibility issues and a deep understanding of the studied signals. Moreover, some techniques need a huge computational power on the CPU and a huge size of RAM. Therefore, several papers proposed to use Deep Learning to get state of the art performance and visualization of the learned features to have more understanding about the neural signals. But, the convolutional neural network (Convnet) are not used properly and the results are often random when we reproduced the works. Hence, we propose a combination of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and a Convnet that processes raw EEG data. The DWT will be used to reduce the size of the data without losing useful information. Also, a modified version of EEGNET will be used to extract the features and classification.	"
01	The driving force behind deep networks is their ability to compactly represent rich classes of functions. The primary notion for formally reasoning about this phenomenon is expressive efficiency, which refers to a situation where one network must grow unfeasibly large in order to replicate functions of another. To date, expressive efficiency analyses focused on the architectural feature of depth, showing that deep networks are representationally superior to shallow ones. In this paper we study the expressive efficiency brought forth by connectivity, motivated by the observation that modern networks interconnect their layers in elaborate ways. We focus on dilated convolutional networks, a family of deep models delivering state of the art performance in sequence processing tasks. By introducing and analyzing the concept of mixed tensor decompositions, we prove that interconnecting dilated convolutional networks can lead to expressive efficiency. In particular, we show that even a single connection between intermediate layers can already lead to an almost quadratic gap, which in large-scale settings typically makes the difference between a model that is practical and one that is not. Empirical evaluation demonstrates how the expressive efficiency of connectivity, similarly to that of depth, translates into gains in accuracy. This leads us to believe that expressive efficiency may serve a key role in developing new tools for deep network design.
01	This paper addresses the problem of evaluating learning systems in safety critical domains such as autonomous driving, where failures can have catastrophic consequences. We focus on two problems: searching for scenarios when learned agents fail and assessing their probability of failure. The standard method for agent evaluation in reinforcement learning, Vanilla Monte Carlo, can miss failures entirely, leading to the deployment of unsafe agents. We demonstrate this is an issue for current agents, where even matching the compute used for training is sometimes insufficient for evaluation. To address this shortcoming, we draw upon the rare event probability estimation literature and propose an adversarial evaluation approach. Our approach focuses evaluation on adversarially chosen situations, while still providing unbiased estimates of failure probabilities. The key difficulty is in identifying these adversarial situations -- since failures are rare there is little signal to drive optimization. To solve this we propose a continuation approach that learns failure modes in related but less robust agents. Our approach also allows reuse of data already collected for training the agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of adversarial evaluation on two standard domains: humanoid control and simulated driving. Experimental results show that our methods can find catastrophic failures and estimate failures rates of agents multiple orders of magnitude faster than standard evaluation schemes, in minutes to hours rather than days.
10	Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved outstanding success in generating the high-quality data. Focusing on the generation process, existing GANs learn a unidirectional mapping from the latent vector to the data. Later, various studies point out that the latent space of GANs is semantically meaningful and can be utilized in advanced data analysis and manipulation. In order to analyze the real data in the latent space of GANs, it is necessary to investigate the inverse generation mapping from the data to the latent vector. To tackle this problem, the bidirectional generative models introduce an encoder to establish the inverse path of the generation process. Unfortunately, this effort leads to the degradation of generation quality because the imperfect generator rather interferes the encoder training and vice versa. In this paper, we propose an effective algorithm to infer the latent vector based on existing unidirectional GANs by preserving their generation quality.It is important to note that we focus on increasing the accuracy and efficiency of the inference mapping but not influencing the GAN performance (i.e., the quality or the diversity of the generated sample).Furthermore, utilizing the proposed inference mapping algorithm, we suggest a new metric for evaluating the GAN models by measuring the reconstruction error of unseen real data.The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm achieves more accurate inference mapping than the existing method and provides the robust metric for evaluating GAN performance. 
10	Traditional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models and other variations of the attention-mechanism such as hierarchical attention have been applied to the text summarization problem. Though there is a hierarchy in the way humans use language by forming paragraphs from sentences and sentences from words, hierarchical models have usually not worked that much better than their traditional seq2seq counterparts. This effect is mainly because either the hierarchical attention mechanisms are too sparse using hard attention or noisy using soft attention. In this paper, we propose a method based on extracting the highlights of a document; a key concept that is conveyed in a few sentences. In a typical text summarization dataset consisting of documents that are 800 tokens in length (average), capturing long-term dependencies is very important, e.g., the last sentence can be grouped with the first sentence of a document to form a summary. LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) proved useful for machine translation. However, they often fail to capture long-term dependencies while modeling long sequences. To address these issues, we have adapted Neural Semantic Encoders (NSE) to text summarization, a class of memory-augmented neural networks by improving its functionalities and proposed a novel hierarchical NSE that outperforms similar previous models significantly. The quality of summarization was improved by augmenting linguistic factors, namely lemma, and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, to each word in the dataset for improved vocabulary coverage and generalization. The hierarchical NSE model on factored dataset outperformed the state-of-the-art by nearly 4 ROUGE points. We further designed and used the first GPU-based self-critical Reinforcement Learning model.
10	We present Predicted Variables, an approach to making machine learning (ML) a first class citizen in programming languages.There is a growing divide in approaches to building systems: using human experts (e.g. programming) on the one hand, and using behavior learned from data (e.g. ML) on the other hand. PVars aim to make using ML in programming easier by hybridizing the two. We leverage the existing concept of variables and create a new type, a predicted variable. PVars are akin to native variables with one important distinction: PVars determine their value using ML when evaluated. We describe PVars and their interface, how they can be used in programming, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on three algorithmic problems: binary search, QuickSort, and caches.We show experimentally that PVars are able to improve over the commonly used heuristics and lead to a better performance than the original algorithms.As opposed to previous work applying ML to algorithmic problems, PVars have the advantage that they can be used within the existing frameworks and do not require the existing domain knowledge to be replaced. PVars allow for a seamless integration of ML into existing systems and algorithms.Our PVars implementation currently relies on standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. To learn faster, PVars use the heuristic function, which they are replacing, as an initial function. We show that PVars quickly pick up the behavior of the initial function and then improve performance beyond that without ever performing substantially worse -- allowing for a safe deployment in critical applications.
10	In this paper, we focus on the conversational machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem, where the input to a model could be a lengthy document and a series of interconnected questions.To deal with long inputs, previous approaches usually chunk them into equally-spaced segments and predict answers based on each chunk independently without considering the information from other chunks. As a result, they may form chunks that fail to cover complete answers or have insufficient contexts around the correct answer required for question answering. Moreover, they are less capable of answering questions that need cross-chunk information.We propose to let a model learn to chunk in a more flexible way via reinforcement learning: a model can decide the next chunk that it wants to process in either reading direction. We also apply recurrent mechanisms to allow information to be transferred between chunks. Experiments on two conversational MRC tasks -- CoQA and QuAC -- demonstrate the effectiveness of our recurrent chunking mechanisms: we can obtain chunks that are more likely to contain complete answers and at the same time provide sufficient contexts around the ground truth answers for better predictions. Specifically, our proposed mechanisms can lead to up to 7.5% improvement in F1 over the baseline when addressing extremely long texts. 
10	Conditional generation refers to the process of sampling from an unknown distribution conditioned on semantics of the data. This can be achieved by augmenting the generative model with the desired semantic labels, albeit it is not straightforward in an unsupervised setting where the semantic label of every data sample is unknown. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a method that can generate samples conditioned on the properties of a latent distribution engineered in accordance with a certain data prior. In particular, a latent space inversion network is trained in tandem with a generative adversarial network such that the modal properties of the latent space distribution are induced in the data generating distribution. We demonstrate that our model, despite being fully unsupervised, is effective in learning meaningful representations through its mode matching property. We validate our method on multiple unsupervised tasks such as conditional generation, dataset attribute discovery and inference using three real world image datasets namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CELEB-A and show that the results are comparable to the state-of-the-art methods. 
10	Motivated by practical applications, we consider unsupervised domain adaptation for classification problems, in the presence of missing data in the target domain. More precisely, we focus on the case where there is a domain shift between source and target domains, while some components of the target data are systematically absent. We propose a way to impute non-stochastic missing data for a classification task by leveraging supervision from a complete source domain through domain adaptation. We introduce a single model performing joint domain adaptation, imputation and classification which is shown to perform well under various representative divergence families (H-divergence, Optimal Transport). We perform experiments on two families of datasets: a classical digit classification benchmark commonly used in domain adaptation papers and real world digital advertising datasets, on which we evaluate our model’s classification performance in an unsupervised setting. We analyze its behavior showing the benefit of explicitly imputing non-stochastic missing data jointly with domain adaptation.
10	Extreme Classification Methods have become of paramount importance, particularly for Information Retrieval (IR) problems, owing to the development of smart algorithms that are scalable to industry challenges. One of the prime class of models that aim to solve the memory and speed challenge of extreme multi-label learning is Group Testing. Multi-label Group Testing (MLGT) methods construct label groups by grouping original labels either randomly or based on some similarity and then train smaller classifiers to first predict the groups and then recover the original label vectors. Recently, a novel approach called MACH (Merged Average Classifiers via Hashing) was proposed which projects the huge label vectors to a small and manageable count-min sketch (CMS) matrix and then learns to predict this matrix to recover the original prediction probabilities. Thereby, the model memory scales O(logK) for K classes. MACH is a simple algorithm which works exceptionally well in practice. Despite this simplicity of MACH, there is a big gap between the theoretical understanding of the trade-offs with MACH. In this paper we fill this gap. Leveraging the theory of count-min sketch we provide precise quantification of the memory-identifiablity tradeoffs. We extend the theory to the case of multi-label classification, where the dependencies make the estimators hard to calculate in closed forms. To mitigate this issue, we propose novel quadratic approximation using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. Our estimator has significantly lower reconstruction error than the typical CMS estimator across various values of number of classes K, label sparsity and compression ratio.
01	Reasoning about uncertain orientations is one of the core problems in many perception tasks such as object pose estimation or motion estimation. In these scenarios, poor illumination conditions, sensor limitations, or appearance invariance may result in highly uncertain estimates. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based representation for orientation uncertainty. By characterizing uncertainty over unit quaternions with the Bingham distribution, we formulate a loss that naturally captures the antipodal symmetry of the representation. We discuss the interpretability of the learned distribution parameters and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on several challenging real-world pose estimation tasks involving uncertain orientations.
01	We show that there exists an inherent tension between the goal of adversarial robustness and that of standard generalization. Specifically, training robust models may not only be more resource-consuming, but also lead to a reduction of standard accuracy. We demonstrate that this trade-off between the standard accuracy of a model and its robustness to adversarial perturbations provably exists even in a fairly simple and natural setting. These findings also corroborate a similar phenomenon observed in practice. Further, we argue that this phenomenon is a consequence of robust classifiers learning fundamentally different feature representations than  standard classifiers. These differences, in particular, seem to result in unexpected benefits: the features learned by robust models tend to align better with salient data characteristics and human perception.
10	Recent work on encoder-decoder models for sequence-to-sequence mapping has shown that integrating both temporal and spatial attentional mechanisms into neural networks increases the performance of the system substantially. We report on a new modular network architecture that applies an attentional mechanism not on temporal and spatial regions of the input, but on sensor selection for multi-sensor setups. This network called the sensor transformation attention network (STAN) is evaluated in scenarios which include the presence of natural noise or synthetic dynamic noise. We demonstrate how the attentional signal responds dynamically to changing noise levels and sensor-specific noise, leading to reduced word error rates (WERs) on both audio and visual tasks using TIDIGITS and GRID; and also on CHiME-3, a multi-microphone real-world noisy dataset. The improvement grows as more channels are corrupted as demonstrated on the CHiME-3 dataset. Moreover, the proposed STAN architecture naturally introduces a number of advantages including ease of removing sensors from existing architectures, attentional interpretability, and increased robustness to a variety of noise environments.
01	In partially observable (PO) environments, deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents often suffer from unsatisfactory performance, since two problems need to be tackled together: how to extract information from the raw observations to solve the task, and how to improve the policy. In this study, we propose an RL algorithm for solving PO tasks. Our method comprises two parts: a variational recurrent model (VRM) for modeling the environment, and an RL controller that has access to both the environment and the VRM. The proposed algorithm was tested in two types of PO robotic control tasks, those in which either coordinates or velocities were not observable and those that require long-term memorization. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieved better data efficiency and/or learned more optimal policy than other alternative approaches in tasks in which unobserved states cannot be inferred from raw observations in a simple manner.
10	Deep learning for object classification relies heavily on convolutional models. While effective, CNNs are rarely interpretable after the fact. An attention mechanism can be used to highlight the area of the image that the model focuses on thus offering a narrow view into the mechanism of classification. We expand on this idea by forcing the method to explicitly align images to be classified to reference images representing the classes. The mechanism of alignment is learned and therefore does not require that the reference objects are anything like those being classified. Beyond explanation, our exemplar based cross-alignment method enables classification with only a single example per category (one-shot). Our model cuts the 5-way, 1-shot error rate in Omniglot from 2.1\% to 1.4\% and in MiniImageNet from 53.5\% to 46.5\% while simultaneously providing point-wise alignment information providing some understanding on what the network is capturing. This method of alignment also enables the recognition of an unsupported class (open-set) in the one-shot setting while maintaining an F1-score of above 0.5 for Omniglot even with 19 other distracting classes while baselines completely fail to separate the open-set class in the one-shot setting.
10	Hyperparameter tuning is a bothersome step in the training of deep learning mod- els. One of the most sensitive hyperparameters is the learning rate of the gradient descent. We present the All Learning Rates At Once (Alrao) optimization method for neural networks: each unit or feature in the network gets its own learning rate sampled from a random distribution spanning several orders of magnitude. This comes at practically no computational cost. Perhaps surprisingly, stochastic gra- dient descent (SGD) with Alrao performs close to SGD with an optimally tuned learning rate, for various architectures and problems. Alrao could save time when testing deep learning models: a range of models could be quickly assessed with Alrao, and the most promising models could then be trained more extensively. This text comes with a PyTorch implementation of the method, which can be plugged on an existing PyTorch model.
01	Analyzing the behavior of neural networks is  one of the most pressing challenges in deep learning.  Binarized Neural Networks are an important class of networks that allow equivalent representation in Boolean logic and can be analyzed formally with logic-based reasoning tools like SAT solvers. Such tools can be used to answer existential and probabilistic queries about the network, perform explanation generation, etc. However, the main bottleneck for all methods is their ability to reason about large BNNs efficiently. In this work, we analyze architectural design choices of BNNs and discuss how they affect the performance of logic-based reasoners. We propose changes to the BNN architecture and the training procedure to get a simpler network for SAT solvers without sacrificing accuracy on the primary task. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales to larger deep neural networks compared to existing work for existential and probabilistic queries, leading to significant speed ups on all tested datasets.
10	Modeling dynamically-evolving, multi-relational graph data has received a surge of interests with the rapid growth of heterogeneous event data. However, predicting future events on such data requires global structure inference over time and the ability to integrate temporal and structural information, which are not yet well understood. We present Recurrent Event Network (RE-Net), a novel autoregressive architecture for modeling temporal sequences of multi-relational graphs (e.g., temporal knowledge graph), which can perform sequential, global structure inference over future time stamps to predict new events. RE-Net employs a recurrent event encoder to model the temporally conditioned joint probability distribution for the event sequences, and equips the event encoder with a neighborhood aggregator for modeling the concurrent events within a time window associated with each entity. We apply teacher forcing for model training over historical data, and infer graph sequences over future time stamps by sampling from the learned joint distribution in a sequential manner. We evaluate the proposed method via temporal link prediction on ﬁve public datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength of RE-Net, especially on multi-step inference over future time stamps.
10	We propose to tackle a time series regression problem by computing temporal evolution of a probability density function to provide a probabilistic forecast. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based model is employed to learn a nonlinear operator for temporal evolution of a probability density function. We use a softmax layer for a numerical discretization of a smooth probability density functions, which transforms a function approximation problem to a classification task. Explicit and implicit regularization strategies are introduced to impose a smoothness condition on the estimated probability distribution. A Monte Carlo procedure to compute the temporal evolution of the distribution for a multiple-step forecast is presented. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm on three synthetic and two real data sets shows advantage over the compared baselines.
01	"We study the problem of generating source code in a strongly typed,Java-like programming language, given a label (for example a set ofAPI calls or types) carrying a small amount of information about thecode that is desired. The generated programs are expected to respect a`""realistic"" relationship between programs and labels, as exemplifiedby a corpus of labeled programs available during training.Two challenges in such *conditional program generation* are thatthe generated programs must satisfy a rich set of syntactic andsemantic constraints, and that source code contains many low-levelfeatures that impede learning.  We address these problems by traininga neural generator not on code but on *program sketches*, ormodels of program syntax that abstract out names and operations thatdo not generalize across programs. During generation, we infer aposterior distribution over sketches, then concretize samples fromthis distribution into type-safe programs using combinatorialtechniques.  We implement our ideas in a system for generatingAPI-heavy Java code, and show that it can often predict the entirebody of a method given just a few API calls or data types that appearin the method."
10	It is valuable yet remains challenging to apply neural networks in logical reasoning tasks. Despite some successes witnessed in learning SAT (Boolean Satisfiability) solvers for propositional logic via Graph Neural Networks (GNN),  there haven't been any successes in learning solvers for more complex predicate logic. In this paper, we target the QBF (Quantified Boolean Formula) satisfiability problem, the complexity of which is in-between propositional logic and predicate logic, and investigate the feasibility of learning GNN-based solvers and GNN-based heuristics for the cases with a universal-existential quantifier alternation (so-called 2QBF problems).We conjecture, with empirical support, that GNNs have certain limitations in learning 2QBF solvers, primarily due to the inability to reason about a set of assignments. Then we show the potential of GNN-based heuristics in CEGAR-based solvers and explore the interesting challenges to generalize them to larger problem instances. In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive surveying view of applying GNN-based embeddings to 2QBF problems and aims to offer insights in applying machine learning tools to more complicated symbolic reasoning problems.
10	In the last few years, deep learning has been tremendously successful in many applications. However, our theoretical understanding of deep learning, and thus the ability of providing principled improvements, seems to lag behind. A theoretical puzzle concerns the ability of deep networks to predict well despite their intriguing apparent lack of generalization: their classification accuracy on the training set is not a proxy for their performance on a test set. How is it possible that training performance is independent of testing performance? Do indeed deep networks require a drastically new theory of generalization? Or are there measurements based on the training data that are predictive of the network performance on future data? Here we show that when performance is measured appropriately, the training performance is in fact predictive of expected performance, consistently with classical machine learning theory.
10	The goal of the paper is to propose an algorithm for learning the most generalizable solution from given training data. It is shown that Bayesian approach leads to a solution that dependent on statistics of training data and not on particularsamples. The solution is stable under perturbations of training data because it is defined by an integral contribution of multiple maxima of the likelihood and not by a single global maximum. Specifically, the Bayesian probability distributionof parameters (weights) of a probabilistic model given by a neural network is estimated via recurrent variational approximations. Derived recurrent update rules correspond to SGD-type rules for finding a minimum of an effective loss that is an average of an original negative log-likelihood over the Gaussian distributions of weights, which makes it a function of means and variances. The effective loss is convex for large variances and non-convex in the limit of small variances. Among stationary solutions of the update rules there are trivial solutions with zero variances at local minima of the original loss and a single non-trivial solution with finite variances that is a critical point at the end of convexity of the effective lossin the mean-variance space. At the critical point both first- and second-order gradients of the effective loss w.r.t. means are zero. The empirical study confirms that the critical point represents the most generalizable solution. While the location ofthe critical point in the weight space depends on specifics of the used probabilistic model some properties at the critical point are universal and model independent.
10	Dual learning has been successfully applied in many machine learning applications, including machine translation, image-to-image  transformation, etc. The high-level idea of dual learning is very intuitive: if we map an x from one domain to another and then map it back, we should recover the original x. Although its effectiveness has been empirically verified, theoretical understanding of dual learning is still missing. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study to understand why and when dual learning can improve a mapping function. Based on the theoretical discoveries, we extend dual learning by introducing more related mappings and propose highly symmetric frameworks, cycle dual learning and multipath dual learning, in both of which we can leverage the feedback signals from additional domains to improve the qualities of the mappings. We prove that both cycle dual learning and multipath dual learning can boost the performance of standard dual learning under mild conditions. Experiments on WMT 14 English↔German and MultiUN English↔French translations verify our theoretical findings on dual learning, and the results on the translations among English, French, and Spanish of MultiUN demonstrate the efficacy of cycle dual learning and multipath dual learning.
01	We demonstrate how to learn efficient heuristics for automated reasoning algorithms for quantified Boolean formulas through deep reinforcement learning. We focus on a backtracking search algorithm, which can already solve formulas of impressive size - up to hundreds of thousands of variables. The main challenge is to find a representation of these formulas that lends itself to making predictions in a scalable way. For a family of challenging problems, we learned a heuristic that solves significantly more formulas compared to the existing handwritten heuristics.
10	In this paper we present a deep Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) method that can be trained end-to-end to perform classification from weak supervision. Our MIL method is implemented as a two stream neural network, specialized in tasks of instance classification and weighting. Our instance weighting stream makes use of Gaussian radial basis function to normalize the instance weights by comparing instances locally within the bag and globally across bags. The final classification score of the bag is an aggregate of all instance classification scores. The instance representation is shared by both instance classification and weighting streams. The Gaussian instance weighting allows us to regularize the representation learning of instances such that all positive instances to be closer to each other w.r.t. the instance weighting function. We evaluate our method on five standard MIL datasets and show that our method outperforms other MIL methods. We also evaluate our model on two datasets where all models are trained end-to-end. Our method obtain better bag-classification and instance classification results on these datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to investigate the robustness of the proposed model and obtain interesting insights.
10	We introduce the deep abstaining classifier -- a deep neural network trained with a novel loss function that provides an abstention option during training. This allows the  DNN to abstain on confusing or difficult-to-learn examples while improving performance on the non-abstained samples. We show that such deep abstaining classifiers can: (i) learn representations for structured noise -- where noisy training labels or confusing examples are correlated with underlying features -- and then learn to abstain based on such features; (ii) enable robust learning in the presence of arbitrary or unstructured noise by identifying noisy samples; and (iii) be used as an effective out-of-category detector that learns to reliably abstain when presented with samples from  unknown classes. We provide analytical results on loss function behavior that enable automatic tuning of accuracy and coverage, and demonstrate the utility of the deep abstaining classifier using multiple image benchmarks, Results indicate significant improvement in learning in the presence of label noise.
10	Similarity measurement plays a central role in various data mining and machine learning tasks. Generally, a similarity measurement solution should, in an ideal state, possess the following three properties: accuracy, efficiency and independence from prior knowledge. Yet unfortunately, vital as similarity measurements are, no previous works have addressed all of them. In this paper, we propose X-Forest, consisting of a group of approximate Random Projection Trees, such that all three targets mentioned above are tackled simultaneously. Our key techniques are as follows. First, we introduced RP Trees into the tasks of similarity measurement such that accuracy is improved. In addition, we enforce certain layers in each tree to share identical projection vectors, such that exalted efficiency is achieved. Last but not least, we introduce randomness into partition to eliminate its reliance on prior knowledge.   We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets, whose results demonstrate that our model, X-Forest, reaches an efficiency of up to 3.5 times higher than RP Trees with negligible compromising on its accuracy, while also being able to outperform traditional Euclidean distance-based similarity metrics by as much as 20% with respect to clustering tasks.   We have released codes in github anonymously so as to meet the demand of reproducibility.
10	Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms work well in sequential decision-making problems when experience can be collected cheaply and model-based RL is effective when system dynamics can be modeled accurately. However, both of these assumptions can be violated in real world problems such as robotics, where querying the system can be prohibitively expensive and real-world dynamics can be difficult to model accurately. Although sim-to-real approaches such as domain randomization attempt to mitigate the effects of biased simulation, they can still suffer from optimization challenges such as local minima and hand-designed distributions for randomization, making it difficult to learn an accurate global value function or policy that directly transfers to the real world. In contrast to RL, Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms use a simulator to optimize a simple policy class online, constructing a closed-loop controller that can effectively contend with real-world dynamics. MPC performance is usually limited by factors such as model bias and the limited horizon of optimization. In this work, we present a novel theoretical connection between information theoretic MPC and entropy regularized RL and develop a Q-learning algorithm that can leverage biased models. We validate the proposed algorithm on sim-to-sim control tasks to demonstrate the improvements over optimal control and reinforcement learning from scratch. Our approach paves the way for deploying reinforcement learning algorithms on real-robots in a systematic manner.
10	Processing sequential data with long term dependencies and learn complex transitions are two major challenges in many deep learning applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture, the Auto-addressing and Recurrent Memory Integrating Network (ARMIN) to address these issues. The ARMIN explicitly stores previous hidden states and recurrently integrate useful past states into current time-step by an efficient memory addressing mechanism. Compared to existing memory networks, the ARMIN is more light-weight and inference-time efficient. Our network can be trained on small slices of long sequential data, and thus, can boost its training speed. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the efficiency of the ARMIN architecture. Codes and models will be available.
10	Adversarial examples have been shown to be an effective way of assessing the robustness of neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, by applying perturbations to the input of a model leading to large degradation in performance. However, these perturbations are only indicative of a weakness in the model if they do not change the semantics of the input in a way that would change the expected output. Using the example of machine translation (MT), we propose a new evaluation framework for adversarial attacks on seq2seq models taking meaning preservation into account and demonstrate that existing methods may not preserve meaning in general. Based on these findings, we propose new constraints for attacks on word-based MT systems and show, via human and automatic evaluation, that they produce more semantically similar adversarial inputs. Furthermore, we show that performing adversarial training with meaning-preserving attacks is beneficial to the model in terms of adversarial robustness without hurting test performance.
10	This work presents the Poincaré Wasserstein Autoencoder, a reformulation ofthe recently proposed Wasserstein autoencoder framework on a non-Euclideanmanifold, the Poincaré ball model of the hyperbolic space H n . By assuming thelatent space to be hyperbolic, we can use its intrinsic hierarchy to impose structureon the learned latent space representations. We show that for datasets with latenthierarchies, we can recover the structure in a low-dimensional latent space. Wealso demonstrate the model in the visual domain to analyze some of its propertiesand show competitive results on a graph link prediction task.
01	In multiagent systems (MASs), each agent makes individual decisions but all of them contribute globally to the system evolution. Learning in MASs is difficult since each agent's selection of actions must take place in the presence of other co-learning agents. Moreover, the environmental stochasticity and uncertainties increase exponentially with the increase in the number of agents. Previous works borrow various multiagent coordination mechanisms into deep learning architecture to facilitate multiagent coordination. However, none of them explicitly consider action semantics between agents that different actions have different influences on other agents. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, named Action Semantics Network (ASN), that explicitly represents such action semantics between agents. ASN characterizes different actions' influence on other agents using neural networks based on the action semantics between them. ASN can be easily combined with existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to boost their performance. Experimental results on StarCraft II micromanagement and Neural MMO show ASN significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art DRL approaches compared with several network architectures.
10	Inspired by neurophysiological discoveries of navigation cells in the mammalianbrain, we introduce the first deep neural network architecture for modeling EgocentricSpatial Memory (ESM). It learns to estimate the pose of the agent andprogressively construct top-down 2D global maps from egocentric views in a spatiallyextended environment. During the exploration, our proposed ESM networkmodel updates belief of the global map based on local observations using a recurrentneural network. It also augments the local mapping with a novel externalmemory to encode and store latent representations of the visited places based ontheir corresponding locations in the egocentric coordinate. This enables the agentsto perform loop closure and mapping correction. This work contributes in thefollowing aspects: first, our proposed ESM network provides an accurate mappingability which is vitally important for embodied agents to navigate to goal locations.In the experiments, we demonstrate the functionalities of the ESM network inrandom walks in complicated 3D mazes by comparing with several competitivebaselines and state-of-the-art Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)algorithms. Secondly, we faithfully hypothesize the functionality and the workingmechanism of navigation cells in the brain. Comprehensive analysis of our modelsuggests the essential role of individual modules in our proposed architecture anddemonstrates efficiency of communications among these modules. We hope thiswork would advance research in the collaboration and communications over bothfields of computer science and computational neuroscience.
10	This paper proposes a method for efficient training of Q-function for continuous-state Markov Decision Processes (MDP), such that the traces of the resulting policies satisfy a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) property. LTL, a modal logic, can express a wide range of time-dependent logical properties including safety and liveness. We convert the LTL property into a limit deterministic Buchi automaton with which a synchronized product MDP is constructed. The control policy is then synthesised by a reinforcement learning algorithm assuming that no prior knowledge is available from the MDP. The proposed method is evaluated in a numerical study to test the quality of the generated control policy and is compared against conventional methods for policy synthesis such as MDP abstraction (Voronoi quantizer) and approximate dynamic programming (fitted value iteration). 
10	The ability to deploy neural networks in real-world, safety-critical systems is severely limited by the presence of adversarial examples: slightly perturbed inputs that are misclassified by the network. In recent years, several techniques have been proposed for training networks that are robust to such examples; and each time stronger attacks have been devised, demonstrating the shortcomings of existing defenses. This highlights a key difficulty in designing an effective defense: the inability to assess a network's robustness against future attacks. We propose to address this difficulty through formal verification techniques. We construct ground truths: adversarial examples with a provably-minimal distance from a given input point. We demonstrate how ground truths can serve to assess the effectiveness of attack techniques, by comparing the adversarial examples produced by those attacks to the ground truths; and also of defense techniques, by computing the distance to the ground truths before and after the defense is applied, and measuring the improvement. We use this technique to assess recently suggested attack and defense techniques.
10	Training agents to operate in one environment often yields overfitted models that are unable to generalize to the changes in that environment. However, due to the numerous variations that can occur in the real-world, the agent is often required to be robust in order to be useful. This has not been the case for agents trained with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the overfitting of RL agents to the training environments in visual navigation tasks. Our experiments show that deep RL agents can overfit even when trained on multiple environments simultaneously. We propose a regularization method which combines RL with supervised learning methods by adding a term to the RL objective that would encourage the invariance of a policy to variations in the observations that ought not to affect the action taken. The results of this method, called invariance regularization, show an improvement in the generalization of policies to environments not seen during training.
10	We introduce HUBERT which combines the structured-representational power of Tensor-Product Representations (TPRs) and BERT, a pre-trained bidirectional transformer language model. We validate the effectiveness of our model on the GLUE benchmark and HANS dataset. We also show that there is shared structure between different NLP datasets which HUBERT, but not BERT, is able to learn and leverage. Extensive transfer-learning experiments are conducted to confirm this proposition.
01	Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples and researchers have proposed many heuristic attack and defense mechanisms. We address this problem through the principled lens of distributionally robust optimization, which guarantees performance under adversarial input perturbations.  By considering a Lagrangian penalty formulation of perturbing the underlying data distribution in a Wasserstein ball, we provide a training procedure that augments model parameter updates with worst-case perturbations of training data. For smooth losses, our procedure provably achieves moderate levels of robustness with little computational or statistical cost relative to empirical risk minimization. Furthermore, our statistical guarantees allow us to efficiently certify robustness for the population loss. For imperceptible perturbations, our method matches or outperforms heuristic approaches.
10	To reach human performance on complex tasks, a key ability for artificialsystems is to understand physical interactions between objects, and predictfuture outcomes of a situation. This ability, often referred to asintuitivephysics, has recently received attention and several methods were proposed tolearn these physical rules from video sequences. Yet, most these methods arerestricted to the case where no occlusions occur, narrowing the potential areasof application. The main contribution of this paper is a method combininga predictor of object dynamics and a neural renderer efficiently predictingfuture trajectories and explicitly modelling partial and full occlusions amongobjects. We present a training procedure enabling learning intuitive physicsdirectly from the input videos containing segmentation masks of objects andtheir depth. Our results show that our model learns object dynamics despitesignificant inter-object occlusions, and realistically predicts segmentationmasks up to 30 frames in the future. We study model performance forincreasing levels of occlusions, and compare results to previous work onthe tasks of future prediction and object following. We also show resultson predicting motion of objects in real videos and demonstrate significantimprovements over state-of-the-art on the object permanence task in theintuitive physics benchmark of Riochet et al. (2018).
10	Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm that bridges Machine Learning and Neuroscience, by computing gradients closely matching those of Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), but with a learning rule local in space.Given an input x and associated target y, EP proceeds in two phases: in the first phase neurons evolve freely towards a first steady state; in the second phase output neurons are nudged towards y until they reach a second steady state.However, in existing implementations of EP, the learning rule is not local in time:the weight update is performed after the dynamics of the second phase have converged and requires information of the first phase that is no longer available physically.This is a major impediment to the biological plausibility of EP and its efficient hardware implementation.In this work, we propose a version of EP named Continual Equilibrium Propagation (C-EP) where neuron and synapse dynamics occur simultaneously throughout the second phase, so that the weight update becomes local in time. We prove theoretically that, provided the learning rates are sufficiently small, at each time step of the second phase the dynamics of neurons and synapses follow the gradients of the loss given by BPTT (Theorem 1).We demonstrate training with C-EP on MNIST and generalize C-EP to neural networks where neurons are connected by asymmetric connections. We show through experiments that the more the network updates follows the gradients of BPTT, the best it performs in terms of training. These results bring EP a step closer to biology while maintaining its intimate link with backpropagation.
10	Automatic neural architecture search techniques are becoming increasingly important in machine learning area recently.  Especially, weight sharing methods have shown remarkable potentials on searching good network architectures with few computational resources. However, existing weight sharing methods mainly suffer limitations on searching strategies: these methods either uniformly train all network paths to convergence which introduces conflicts between branches and wastes a large amount of computation on unpromising candidates, or selectively train branches with different frequency which leads to unfair evaluation and comparison among paths. To address these issues, we propose a novel neural architecture search method  with balanced training strategy to ensure fair comparisons and a selective drop mechanism to reduces conflicts among candidate paths. The experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve a leading performance of 79.0% on ImageNet under mobile settings, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency.
10	Learning diverse and natural behaviors is one of the longstanding goal for creating intelligent characters in the animated world. In this paper, we propose ``COmposable Semi-parametric MOdelling'' (COSMO), a method for generating long range diverse and distinctive behaviors to achieve a specific goal location. Our proposed method learns to model the motion of human by combining the complementary strengths of both non-parametric techniques and parametric ones. Given the starting and ending state, a memory bank is used to retrieve motion references that are provided as source material to a deep network. The synthesis is performed by a deep network that controls the style of the provided motion material and modifies it to become natural. On skeleton datasets with diverse motion, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing parametric and non-parametric baselines. We also demonstrate the generated sequences are useful as subgoals for actual physical execution in the animated world. 
10	"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of deep generative models which aim to learn a target distribution in an unsupervised fashion. While they were successfully applied to many problems, training a GAN is a notoriously challenging task and requires a significant amount of hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture engineering, and a non-trivial amount of ``tricks"". The success in many practical applications coupled with the lack of a measure to quantify the failure modes of GANs resulted in a plethora of proposed losses, regularization and normalization schemes, and neural architectures. In this work we take a sober view of the current state of GANs from a practical perspective. We reproduce the current state of the art and go beyond fairly exploring the GAN landscape. We discuss common pitfalls and reproducibility issues, open-source our code on Github, and provide pre-trained models on TensorFlow Hub."
10	Change-point detection problem consists of discovering abrupt property changes in the generation process of time-series. Most state-of-the-art models are optimizing the power of a kernel two-sample test, with only a few assumptions on the distribution of the data. Unfortunately, because they presume the samples are distributed i.i.d, they are not able to use information about the seasonality of a time-series. In this paper, we present a novel approach - ATR-CSPD allowing the detection of changes in the seasonal pattern of a time-series. Our method uses an autoencoder together with a temporal regularization, to learn the pattern of each seasonal cycle. Using low dimensional representation of the seasonal patterns, it is possible to accurately and efficiently estimate the existence of a change point using a clustering algorithm. Through experiments on artificial and real-world data sets, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method for several applications.
01	"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are powerful models for learning representations of attributed graphs. To scale GCNs to large graphs, state-of-the-art methods use various layer sampling techniques to alleviate the ""neighbor explosion"" problem during minibatch training. We propose GraphSAINT, a graph sampling based inductive learning method that improves training efficiency and accuracy in a fundamentally different way. By changing perspective, GraphSAINT constructs minibatches by sampling the training graph, rather than the nodes or edges across GCN layers. Each iteration, a complete GCN is built from the properly sampled subgraph. Thus, we ensure fixed number of well-connected nodes in all layers. We further propose normalization technique to eliminate bias, and sampling algorithms for variance reduction. Importantly, we can decouple the sampling from the forward and backward propagation, and extend GraphSAINT with many architecture variants (e.g., graph attention, jumping connection).  GraphSAINT demonstrates superior performance in both accuracy and training time on five large graphs, and achieves new state-of-the-art F1 scores for PPI (0.995) and Reddit (0.970). "
01	Imitation learning, followed by reinforcement learning algorithms, is a promising paradigm to solve complex control tasks sample-efficiently. However, learning from demonstrations often suffers from the covariate shift problem, which resultsin cascading errors of the learned policy. We introduce a notion of conservatively extrapolated value functions, which provably lead to policies with self-correction. We design an algorithm Value Iteration with Negative Sampling (VINS) that practically learns such value functions with conservative extrapolation. We show that VINS can correct mistakes of the behavioral cloning policy on simulated robotics benchmark tasks. We also propose the algorithm of using VINS to initialize a reinforcement learning algorithm, which is shown to outperform prior works in sample efficiency.
10	Recent work has introduced attacks that extract the architecture information of deep neural networks (DNN), as this knowledge enhances an adversary’s capability to conduct attacks on black-box networks. This paper presents the first in-depth security analysis of DNN fingerprinting attacks that exploit cache side-channels.  First, we define the threat model for these attacks:  our adversary does not need the ability to query the victim model; instead, she runs a co-located process on the host machine victim ’s deep learning  (DL) system is running and passively monitors the accesses of the target functions in the shared framework.  Second, we introduce DeepRecon, an attack that reconstructs the architecture of the victim network by using the internal information extracted via Flush+Reload, a cache side-channel technique. Once the attacker observes function invocations that map directly to architecture attributes of the victim network, the attacker can reconstruct the victim’s entire network architecture.  In our evaluation, we demonstrate that an attacker can accurately reconstruct two complex networks (VGG19 and ResNet50) having only observed one forward propagation. Based on the extracted architecture attributes, we also demonstrate that an attacker can build a meta-model that accurately fingerprints the architecture and family of the pre-trained model in a transfer learning setting. From this meta-model,  we evaluate the importance of the observed attributes in the fingerprinting process. Third, we propose and evaluate new framework-level defense techniques that obfuscate our attacker’s observations. Our empirical security analysis represents a step toward understanding the DNNs’ vulnerability to cache side-channel attacks.
10	An unintended consequence of feature sharing is the model fitting to correlated tasks within the dataset, termed negative transfer.  In this paper, we revisit the problem of negative transfer in multitask setting and find that its corrosive effects are applicable to a wide range of linear and non-linear models, including neural networks. We first study the effects of negative transfer in a principled way and show that previously proposed counter-measures are insufficient, particularly for trainable features. We propose an adversarial training approach to mitigate the effects of negative transfer by viewing the problem in a domain adaptation setting. Finally, empirical results on attribute prediction multi-task on AWA and CUB datasets further validate the need for correcting negative sharing in an end-to-end manner.
10	One of the attractive characteristics of deep neural networks is their ability to transfer knowledge obtained in one domain to other related domains. As a result, high-quality networks can be trained in domains with relatively little training data. This property has been extensively studied for discriminative networks but has received significantly less attention for generative models.  Given the often enormous effort which is required to train GANs, both computationally as well as in the collection of datasets, the re-use of pretrained GANs is a desirable objective. Therefore, we investigate various scenarios of knowledge transfer for generative models and propose methods to mine the knowledge that is most beneficial to a specific target domain from a single or multiple pretrained GANs. This is done using a miner network that identifies which part of the generative distribution of the pretrained GAN outputs samples closest to the target domain. In the multiple GAN case, We also train a selector to learn a prior over the available pretrained GANs.  We show that both the selector and the miner can be trained by applying a selective backpropagation procedure on the critic output. We perform experiments on several complex datasets using various GAN architectures (BigGAN, Progressive GAN) and show that the proposed method, called MineGAN, effectively transfers knowledge to small domains, outperforming existing methods. In addition, MineGAN can successfully transfer knowledge from multiple pretrained GANs. 
10	Large-scale publicly available datasets play a fundamental role in training deep learning models. However, large-scaledatasets are difficult to collect in problems that involve processing of sensitive information.Collaborative learning techniques provide a privacy-preserving solution in such cases, by enablingtraining over a number of private datasets that are not shared by their owners.Existing collaborative learningtechniques, combined with differential privacy, are shown to be resilient against a passiveadversary which tries to infer the training data only from the model parameters. However, recently, it hasbeen shown that the existing collaborative learning techniques are vulnerable to an active adversary that runs a GANattack during the learning phase. In this work, we propose a novel key-based collaborative learning technique that isresilient against such GAN attacks. For this purpose, we present a collaborative learning formulation in which class scores are protected by class-specific keys, and therefore, prevents a GAN attack. We also show thatvery high dimensional class-specific keys can be utilized to improve robustness against attacks, without increasing the model complexity. Our experimental results on two popular datasets, MNIST and AT&T Olivetti Faces, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniqueagainst the GAN attack. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first collaborative learningformulation that effectively tackles an active adversary, and, unlike model corruption or differential privacy formulations,our approach does not inherently feature a trade-off between model accuracy and data privacy.
01	Multilingual machine translation, which translates multiple languages with a single model, has attracted much attention due to its efficiency of offline training and online serving. However, traditional multilingual translation usually yields inferior accuracy compared with the counterpart using individual models for each language pair, due to language diversity and model capacity limitations. In this paper, we propose a distillation-based approach to boost the accuracy of multilingual machine translation. Specifically, individual models are first trained and regarded as teachers, and then the multilingual model is trained to fit the training data and match the outputs of individual models simultaneously through knowledge distillation. Experiments on IWSLT, WMT and Ted talk translation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Particularly, we show that one model is enough to handle multiple languages (up to 44 languages in our experiment), with comparable or even better accuracy than individual models.
01	"Information bottleneck (IB) is a method for extracting information from one random variable X that is relevant for predicting another random variable Y. To do so, IB identifies an intermediate ""bottleneck"" variable T that has low mutual information I(X;T) and high mutual information I(Y;T). The ""IB curve"" characterizes the set of bottleneck variables that achieve maximal I(Y;T) for a given I(X;T), and is typically explored by maximizing the ""IB Lagrangian"", I(Y;T) - βI(X;T). In some cases, Y is a deterministic function of X, including many classification problems in supervised learning where the output class Y is a deterministic function of the input X. We demonstrate three caveats when using IB in any situation where Y is a deterministic function of X: (1) the IB curve cannot be recovered by maximizing the IB Lagrangian for different values of β; (2) there are ""uninteresting"" trivial solutions at all points of the IB curve; and (3) for multi-layer classifiers that achieve low prediction error, different layers cannot exhibit a strict trade-off between compression and prediction, contrary to a recent proposal. We also show that when Y is a small perturbation away from being a deterministic function of X, these three caveats arise in an approximate way. To address problem (1), we propose a functional that, unlike the IB Lagrangian, can recover the IB curve in all cases. We demonstrate the three caveats on the MNIST dataset."
10	Voice Conversion (VC) is a task of converting perceived speaker identity from a source speaker to a particular target speaker. Earlier approaches in the literature primarily find a mapping between the given source-target speaker-pairs. Developing mapping techniques for many-to-many VC using non-parallel data, including zero-shot learning remains less explored areas in VC. Most of the many-to-many VC architectures require training data from all the target speakers for whom we want to convert the voices. In this paper, we propose a novel style transfer architecture, which can also be extended to generate voices even for target speakers whose data were not used in the training (i.e., case of zero-shot learning). In particular, propose Adaptive Generative Adversarial Network (AdaGAN), new architectural training procedure help in learning normalized speaker-independent latent representation, which will be used to generate speech with different speaking styles in the context of VC. We compare our results with the state-of-the-art StarGAN-VC architecture. In particular, the AdaGAN achieves 31.73%, and 10.37% relative improvement compared to the StarGAN in MOS tests for speech quality and speaker similarity, respectively. The key strength of the proposed architectures is that it yields these results with less computational complexity. AdaGAN is 88.6% less complex than StarGAN-VC in terms of FLoating Operation Per Second (FLOPS), and 85.46% less complex in terms of trainable parameters.  
01	Domain adaptation refers to the problem of leveraging labeled data in a source domain to learn an accurate model in a target domain where labels are scarce or unavailable. A recent approach for finding a common representation of the two domains is via domain adversarial training (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015), which attempts to induce a feature extractor that matches the source and target feature distributions in some feature space. However, domain adversarial training faces two critical limitations: 1) if the feature extraction function has high-capacity, then feature distribution matching is a weak constraint, 2) in non-conservative domain adaptation (where no single classifier can perform well in both the source and target domains), training the model to do well on the source domain hurts performance on the target domain. In this paper, we address these issues through the lens of the cluster assumption, i.e., decision boundaries should not cross high-density data regions. We propose two novel and related models: 1) the Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation (VADA) model, which combines domain adversarial training with a penalty term that punishes the violation the cluster assumption; 2) the Decision-boundary Iterative Refinement Training with a Teacher (DIRT-T) model, which takes the VADA model as initialization and employs natural gradient steps to further minimize the cluster assumption violation. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that the combination of these two models significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance on the digit, traffic sign, and Wi-Fi recognition domain adaptation benchmarks.
10	While recent progress in deep reinforcement learning has enabled robots to learn complex behaviors, tasks with long horizons and sparse rewards remain an ongoing challenge. In this work, we propose an effective reward shaping method through predictive coding to tackle sparse reward problems. By learning predictive representations offline and using these representations for reward shaping, we gain access to reward signals that understand the structure and dynamics of the environment. In particular, our method achieves better learning by providing reward signals that 1) understand environment dynamics 2) emphasize on features most useful for learning 3) resist noise in learned representations through reward accumulation. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in different domains ranging from robotic manipulation to navigation, and we show that reward signals produced through predictive coding are as effective for learning as hand-crafted rewards.
10	This work proposes a closed-loop, uncertainty-driven adaptive sampling frame- work (CLUDAS) for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) via deep Bayesian inversion. By closed-loop, we mean that our samples adapt in real- time to the incoming data. To our knowledge, we demonstrate the first genera- tive adversarial network (GAN) based framework for posterior estimation over a continuum sampling rates of an inverse problem. We use this estimator to drive the sampling for accelerated MRI. Our numerical evidence demonstrates that the variance estimate strongly correlates with the expected MSE improvement for dif- ferent acceleration rates even with few posterior samples. Moreover, the resulting masks bring improvements to the state-of-the-art fixed and active mask designing approaches across MSE, posterior variance and SSIM on real undersampled MRI scans.
10	We apply Bayesian Neural Networks to improve calibration of state-of-the-art deepneural networks. We show that, even with the most basic amortized approximateposterior distribution, and fast fully connected neural network for the likelihood,the Bayesian framework clearly outperforms other simple maximum likelihoodbased solutions that have recently shown very good performance, as temperaturescaling. As an example, we reduce the Expected CalibrationError (ECE) from 0.52 to 0.24 on CIFAR-10 and from 4.28 to 2.456 on CIFAR-100on two Wide ResNet with 96.13% and 80.39% accuracy respectively, which areamong the best results published for this task. We demonstrate our robustness andperformance with experiments on a wide set of state-of-the-art computer visionmodels. Moreover, our approach acts off-line, and thus can be applied to anyprobabilistic model regardless of the limitations that the model may present duringtraining. This make it suitable to calibrate systems that make use of pre-traineddeep neural networks that are expensive to train for a specific task, or to directlytrain a calibrated deep convolutional model with Monte Carlo Dropout approximations, among others. However,our method is still complementary with any Bayesian Neural Network for furtherimprovement.
10	A typical experiment to study cognitive function is to train animals to perform tasks, while the researcher records the electrical activity of the animals neurons. The main obstacle faced, when using this type of electrophysiological experiment to uncover the circuit mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, is our incomplete access to relevant circuits in the brain. One promising approach is to model neural circuits using an artificial neural network (ANN), which can provide complete access to the “neural circuits” responsible for a behavior. More recently, reinforcement learning models have been adopted to understand the functions of cortico-basal ganglia circuits as reward-based learning has been found in mammalian brain. In this paper, we propose a Biologically-plausible Actor-Critic with Episodic Memory (B-ACEM) framework to model a prefrontal cortex-basal ganglia-hippocampus (PFC-BG) circuit, which is verified to capture the behavioral findings from a well-known perceptual decision-making task, i.e., random dots motion discrimination. This B-ACEM framework links neural computation to behaviors, on which we can explore how episodic memory should be considered to govern future decision. Experiments are conducted using different settings of the episodic memory and results show that all patterns of episodic memories can speed up learning. In particular, salient events are prioritized to propagate reward information and guide decisions. Our B-ACEM framework and the built-on experiments give inspirations to both designs for more standard decision-making models in biological system and a more biologically-plausible ANN.
10	Designing a molecule with desired properties is one of the biggest challenges in drug development, as it requires optimization of chemical compound structures with respect to many complex properties. To augment the compound design process we introduce Mol-CycleGAN -- a CycleGAN-based model that generates optimized compounds with a chemical scaffold of interest. Namely, given a molecule our model generates a structurally similar one with an optimized value of the considered property. We evaluate the performance of the model on selected optimization objectives related to structural properties (presence of halogen groups, number of aromatic rings) and to a physicochemical property (penalized logP). In the task of optimization of penalized logP of drug-like molecules our model significantly outperforms previous results. 
01	Research on exploration in reinforcement learning, as applied to Atari 2600 game-playing, has emphasized tackling difficult exploration problems such as Montezuma's Revenge (Bellemare et al., 2016). Recently, bonus-based exploration methods, which explore by augmenting the environment reward, have reached above-human average performance on such domains. In this paper we reassess popular bonus-based exploration methods within a common evaluation framework. We combine Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018) with different exploration bonuses and evaluate its performance on Montezuma's Revenge, Bellemare et al.'s set of hard of exploration games with sparse rewards, and the whole Atari 2600 suite. We find that while exploration bonuses lead to higher score on Montezuma's Revenge they do not provide meaningful gains over the simpler epsilon-greedy scheme. In fact, we find that methods that perform best on that game often underperform epsilon-greedy on easy exploration Atari 2600 games. We find that our conclusions remain valid even when hyperparameters are tuned for these easy-exploration games. Finally, we find that none of the methods surveyed benefit from additional training samples (1 billion frames, versus Rainbow's 200 million) on Bellemare et al.'s hard exploration games. Our results suggest that recent gains in Montezuma's Revenge may be better attributed to architecture change, rather than better exploration schemes; and that the real pace of progress in exploration research for Atari 2600 games may have been obfuscated by good results on a single domain.
10	This work investigates the performance of a composite neural network, which is composed of pre-trained neural network models and non-instantiated neural network models, connected to form a rooted directed graph. A pre-trained neural network model is generally a well trained neural network model targeted for a specific function. The advantages of adopting such a pre-trained model in a composite neural network are two folds. One is to benefit from other's intelligence and diligence and the other is saving the efforts in data preparation and resources and time in training. However, the overall performance of composite neural network is still not clear. In this work, we prove that a composite neural network, with high probability, performs better than any of its pre-trained components under certain assumptions. In addition, if an extra pre-trained component is added to a composite network, with high probability the overall performance will be improved. In the empirical evaluations, distinctively different applications support the above findings.   
10	Recently, there have been some attempts to use non-recurrent neural models for language modeling. However, a noticeable performance gap still remains. We propose a non-recurrent neural language model, dubbed graph temporal convolutional network (GTCN), that relies on graph neural network blocks and convolution operations. While the standard recurrent neural network language models encode sentences sequentially without modeling higher-level structural information, our model regards sentences as graphs and processes input words within a message propagation framework, aiming to learn better syntactic information by inferring skip-word connections. Specifically, the graph network blocks operate in parallel and learn the underlying graph structures in sentences without any additional annotation pertaining to structure knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that the model without recurrence can achieve comparable perplexity results in language modeling tasks and successfully learn syntactic information.
10	Super Resolution (SR) is a fundamental and important low-level computer vision (CV) task. Different from traditional SR models, this study concentrates on a specific but realistic SR issue: How can we obtain satisfied SR results from compressed JPG (C-JPG) image, which widely exists on the Internet. In general, C-JPG can release storage space while keeping considerable quality in visual. However, further image processing operations, e.g., SR, will suffer from enlarging inner artificial details and result in unacceptable outputs. To address this problem, we propose a novel SR structure with two specifically designed components, as well as a cycle loss. In short, there are mainly three contributions to this paper. First, our research can generate high-qualified SR images for prevalent C-JPG images. Second, we propose a functional sub-model to recover information for C-JPG images, instead of the perspective of noise elimination in traditional SR approaches. Third, we further integrate cycle loss into SR solver to build a hybrid loss function for better SR generation. Experiments show that our approach achieves outstanding performance among state-of-the-art methods.
01	Adversarial attacks on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have gained significant attention and there have been active research efforts on defense mechanisms. Stochastic input transformation methods have been proposed, where the idea is to recover the image from adversarial attack by random transformation, and to take the majority vote as consensus among the random samples. However, the transformation improves the accuracy on adversarial images at the expense of the accuracy on clean images. While it is intuitive that the accuracy on clean images would deteriorate, the exact mechanism in which how this occurs is unclear. In this paper, we study the distribution of softmax induced by stochastic transformations. We observe that with random transformations on the clean images, although the mass of the softmax distribution could shift to the wrong class, the resulting distribution of softmax could be used to correct the prediction. Furthermore, on the adversarial counterparts, with the image transformation, the resulting shapes of the distribution of softmax are similar to the distributions from the clean images. With these observations, we propose a method to improve existing transformation-based defenses. We train a separate lightweight distribution classifier to recognize distinct features in the distributions of softmax outputs of transformed images. Our empirical studies show that our distribution classifier, by training on distributions obtained from clean images only, outperforms majority voting for both clean and adversarial images. Our method is generic and can be integrated with existing transformation-based defenses.
10	"In this paper, we describe the ""implicit autoencoder"" (IAE), a generative autoencoder in which both the generative path and the recognition path are parametrized by implicit distributions. We use two generative adversarial networks to define the reconstruction and the regularization cost functions of the implicit autoencoder, and derive the learning rules based on maximum-likelihood learning. Using implicit distributions allows us to learn more expressive posterior and conditional likelihood distributions for the autoencoder. Learning an expressive conditional likelihood distribution enables the latent code to only capture the abstract and high-level information of the data, while the remaining information is captured by the implicit conditional likelihood distribution. For example, we show that implicit autoencoders can disentangle the global and local information, and perform deterministic or stochastic reconstructions of the images. We further show that implicit autoencoders can disentangle discrete underlying factors of variation from the continuous factors in an unsupervised fashion, and perform clustering and semi-supervised learning."
10	Neural machine translation, which achieves near human-level performance in some languages, strongly relies on the availability of large amounts of parallel sentences, which hinders its applicability to low-resource language pairs. Recent works explore the possibility of unsupervised machine translation with monolingual data only, leading to much lower accuracy compared with the supervised one. Observing that weakly paired bilingual documents are much easier to collect than bilingual sentences, e.g., from Wikipedia, news websites or books, in this paper, we investigate the training of translation models with weakly paired bilingual documents. Our approach contains two components/steps. First, we provide a simple approach to mine implicitly bilingual sentence pairs from document pairs which can then be used as supervised signals for training. Second, we leverage the topic consistency of two weakly paired documents and learn the sentence-to-sentence translation by constraining the word distribution-level alignments.  We evaluate our proposed method on weakly paired documents from Wikipedia on four tasks, the widely used WMT16 German$\leftrightarrow$English and WMT13 Spanish$\leftrightarrow$English tasks, and obtain $24.1$/$30.3$ and $28.0$/$27.6$ BLEU points separately, outperformingstate-of-the-art unsupervised results by more than 5 BLEU points and reducing the gap between unsupervised translation and supervised translation up to 50\%. 
10	Despite deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) demonstrate strong performance in text classification, training RNN models are often expensive and requires an extensive collection of annotated data which may not be available. To overcome the data limitation issue, existing approaches leverage either pre-trained word embedding or sentence representation to lift the burden of training RNNs from scratch. In this paper, we show that jointly learning sentence representations from multiple text classification tasks and combining them with pre-trained word-level and sentence level encoders result in robust sentence representations that are useful for transfer learning. Extensive experiments and analyses using a wide range of transfer and linguistic tasks endorse the effectiveness of our approach.
01	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), though powerful, is hard to train. Several recent works (Brock et al., 2016; Miyato et al., 2018) suggest that controlling the spectra of weight matrices in the discriminator can significantly improve the training of GANs. Motivated by their discovery, we propose a new framework for training GANs, which allows more flexible spectrum control (e.g., making the weight matrices of the discriminator have slow singular value decays). Specifically, we propose a new reparameterization approach for the weight matrices of the discriminator in GANs, which allows us to directly manipulate the spectra of the weight matrices through various regularizers and constraints, without intensively computing singular value decompositions. Theoretically, we further show that the spectrum control improves the generalization ability of GANs. Our experiments on CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImgaeNet datasets confirm that compared to other competitors, our proposed method is capable of generating images with better or equal quality by utilizing spectral normalization and encouraging the slow singular value decay.
10	We propose a feature extraction for periodic signals. Virtually every mechanized transportation vehicle, power generation, industrial machine, and robotic system contains rotating shafts. It is possible to collect data about periodicity by mea- suring a shaft’s rotation. However, it is difficult to perfectly control the collection timing of the measurements. Imprecise timing creates phase shifts in the resulting data. Although a phase shift does not materially affect the measurement of any given data point collected, it does alter the order in which all of the points are col- lected. It is difficult for classical methods, like multi-layer perceptron, to identify or quantify these alterations because they depend on the order of the input vectors’ components. This paper proposes a robust method for extracting features from phase shift data by adding a graph structure to each data point and constructing a suitable machine learning architecture for graph data with cyclic permutation. Simulation and experimental results illustrate its effectiveness.
10	The contributions of this paper are two-fold. We define a new filtration called the cover filtration built from a single cover based on a generalized Steinhaus distance, which is a generalization of Jaccard distance. We then develop a language and theory for stable paths within this filtration, inspired by ideas of persistent homology. This framework can be used to develop several new learning representations in applications where an obvious metric may not be defined but a cover is readily available. We demonstrate the utility of our framework as applied to recommendation systems and explainable machine learning.We demonstrate a new perspective for modeling recommendation system data sets that does not require manufacturing a bespoke metric. As a direct application, we find that the stable paths identified by our framework in a movies data set represent a sequence of movies constituting a gentle transition and ordering from one genre to another.For explainable machine learning, we apply the Mapper for model induction, providing explanations in the form of paths between subpopulations. Our framework provides an alternative way of building a filtration from a single mapper that is then used to explore stable paths. As a direct illustration, we build a mapper from a supervised machine learning model trained on the FashionMNIST data set. We show that the stable paths in the cover filtration provide improved explanations of relationships between subpopulations of images.
10	We  propose an  interactive  classification approach  for natural  language  queries. Instead of classifying given the natural language query only, we ask the user for additional information using a sequence of binary and multiple-choice questions. At each turn, we use a policy controller to decide if to present a question or pro-vide the user the final answer, and select the best question to ask by maximizing the system information gain. Our formulation enables bootstrapping the system without any interaction data, instead relying on non-interactive crowdsourcing an-notation tasks. Our evaluation shows the interaction helps the system increase its accuracy and handle ambiguous queries, while our approach effectively balances the number of questions and the final accuracy.
10	Despite their successes, deep neural networks still make unreliable predictions when faced with test data drawn from a distribution different to that of the training data, constituting a major problem for AI safety. While this motivated a recent surge in interest in developing methods to detect such out-of-distribution (OoD) inputs, a robust solution is still lacking. We propose a new probabilistic, unsupervised approach to this problem based on a Bayesian variational autoencoder model, which estimates a full posterior distribution over the decoder parameters using stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo, instead of fitting a point estimate. We describe how information-theoretic measures based on this posterior can then be used to detect OoD data both in input space as well as in the model’s latent space. The effectiveness of our approach is empirically demonstrated.
10	We develop the Y-learner for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. The Y-learner is designed to leverage the abilities of neural networks to optimize multiple objectives and continually update, which allows for better pooling of underlying feature information between treatment and control groups. We evaluate the Y-learner on three test problems: (1) A set of six simulated data benchmarks from the literature. (2) A real-world large-scale experiment on voter persuasion. (3) A task from the literature that estimates artificially generated treatment effects on MNIST didgits. The Y-learner achieves state of the art results on two of the three tasks. On the MNIST task, it gets the second best results. 
10	Despite its omnipresence in robotics application, the nature of spatial knowledge and the mechanisms that underlie its emergence in autonomous agents are still poorly understood. Recent theoretical work suggests that the concept of space can be grounded by capturing invariants induced by the structure of space in an agent's raw sensorimotor experience. Moreover, it is hypothesized that capturing these invariants is beneficial for a naive agent trying to predict its sensorimotor experience. Under certain exploratory conditions, spatial representations should thus emerge as a byproduct of learning to predict.We propose a simple sensorimotor predictive scheme, apply it to different agents and types of exploration, and evaluate the pertinence of this hypothesis. We show that a naive agent can capture the topology and metric regularity of its spatial configuration without any a priori knowledge, nor extraneous supervision.
10	Learning disentangling representations of the independent factors of variations that explain the data in an unsupervised setting is still a major challenge. In the following paper we address the task of disentanglement and introduce a new state-of-the-art approach called Non-synergistic variational Autoencoder (Non-Syn VAE). Our model draws inspiration from population coding, where the notion of synergy arises when we describe the encoded information by neurons in the form of responses from the stimuli. If those responses convey more information together than separate as independent sources of encoding information, they are acting synergetically. By penalizing the synergistic mutual information within the latents we encourage information independence and by doing that disentangle the latent factors. Notably, our approach could be added to the VAE framework easily, where the new ELBO function is still a lower bound on the log likelihood. In addition, we qualitatively compare our model with Factor VAE and show that this one implicitly minimises the synergy of the latents.
10	We tackle the challenge of using machine learning to find algorithms with strong worst-case guarantees for online combinatorial optimization problems. Whereas the previous approach along this direction (Kong et al., 2018) relies on significant domain expertise to provide hard distributions over input instances at training, we ask whether this can be accomplished from first principles, i.e., without any human-provided data beyond specifying the objective of the optimization problem. To answer this question, we draw insights from classic results in game theory, analysis of algorithms, and online learning to introduce a novel framework. At the high level, similar to a generative adversarial network (GAN), our framework has two components whose respective goals are to learn the optimal algorithm as well as a set of input instances that captures the essential difficulty of the given optimization problem. The two components are trained against each other and evolved simultaneously. We test our ideas on the ski rental problem and the fractional AdWords problem. For these well-studied problems, our preliminary results demonstrate that the framework is capable of finding algorithms as well as difficult input instances that are consistent with known optimal results. We believe our new framework points to a promising direction which can facilitate the research of algorithm design by leveraging ML to improve the state of the art both in theory and in practice.        
10	Quantum mechanics fundamentally forbids deterministic discrimination of quantum states and processes. However, the ability to optimally distinguish various classes of quantum data is an important primitive in quantum information science. In this work, we trained near-term quantum circuits to classify data represented by quantum states using the Adam stochastic optimization algorithm. This is achieved by iterative interactions of a classical device with a quantum processor to discover the parameters of an unknown non-unitary quantum circuit. This circuit learns to simulate the unknown structure of a generalized quantum measurement, or positive-operator valued measure (POVM), that is required to optimally distinguish possible distributions of quantum inputs. Notably we used universal circuit topologies, with a theoretically motivated circuit design which guaranteed that our circuits can perform arbitrary input-output mappings. Our numerical simulations showed that quantum circuits could be trained to discriminate among various pure and mixed quantum states, exhibiting a trade-off between minimizing erroneous and inconclusive outcomes with comparable performance to theoretically optimal POVMs. We trained the circuit on different classes of quantum data and evaluated the generalization error on unseen quantum data. This generalization power hence distinguishes our work from standard circuit optimization and provides an example of quantum machine learning for a task that has inherently no classical analogue. 
10	Many important classification performance metrics, e.g. $F$-measure, are non-differentiable and non-decomposable, and are thus unfriendly to gradient descent algorithm.Consequently, despite their popularity as evaluation metrics, these metrics are rarely optimized as training objectives in neural network community.In this paper, we propose an empirical utility maximization scheme with provable learning guarantees to address the non-differentiability of these metrics. We then derive a strongly consistent gradient estimator to handle non-decomposability.These innovations enable end-to-end optimization of these metrics with the same computational complexity as optimizing a decomposable and differentiable metric, e.g. cross-entropy loss.
01	In implicit models, one often interpolates between sampled points in latent space. As we show in this paper, care needs to be taken to match-up the distributional assumptions on code vectors with the geometry of the interpolating paths.  Otherwise, typical assumptions about the quality and semantics of in-between points may not be justified. Based on our analysis we propose to modify the prior code distribution to put significantly more probability mass closer to the origin. As a result, linear interpolation paths are not only shortest paths, but they are also guaranteed to pass through high-density regions, irrespective of the dimensionality of the latent space. Experiments on standard benchmark image datasets demonstrate clear visual improvements in the quality of the generated samples and exhibit more meaningful interpolation paths.
10	We study how to leverage off-the-shelf visual and linguistic data to cope with out-of-vocabulary answers in visual question answering. Existing large-scale visual data with annotations such as image class labels, bounding boxes and region descriptions are good sources for learning rich and diverse visual concepts. However, it is not straightforward how the visual concepts should be captured and transferred to visual question answering models due to missing link between question dependent answering models and visual data without question or task specification. We tackle this problem in two steps: 1) learning a task conditional visual classifier based on unsupervised task discovery and 2) transferring and adapting the task conditional visual classifier to visual question answering models. Specifically, we employ linguistic knowledge sources such as structured lexical database (e.g. Wordnet) and visual descriptions for unsupervised task discovery, and adapt a learned task conditional visual classifier to answering unit in a visual question answering model. We empirically show that the proposed algorithm generalizes to unseen answers successfully using the knowledge transferred from the visual data.
01	Scalability in terms of object density in a scene is a primary challenge in unsupervised sequential object-oriented representation learning. Most of the previous models have been shown to work only on scenes with a few objects. In this paper, we propose SCALOR, a probabilistic generative world model for learning SCALable Object-oriented Representation of a video. With the proposed spatially parallel attention and proposal-rejection mechanisms, SCALOR can deal with orders of magnitude larger numbers of objects compared to the previous state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we introduce a background module that allows SCALOR to model complex dynamic backgrounds as well as many foreground objects in the scene. We demonstrate that SCALOR can deal with crowded scenes containing up to a hundred objects while jointly modeling complex dynamic backgrounds. Importantly, SCALOR is the ﬁrst unsupervised object representation model shown to work for natural scenes containing several tens of moving objects.
10	There has been an ongoing cycle where stronger detection mechanisms and defenses against adversarial attacks are subsequently broken by a more advanced defense-aware attack. We present a new approach, which we argue is a step towards ending this cycle by deflecting adversarial attacks, i.e., by forcing the attacker to produce an input which semantically resembles the attack's target class. To this end, we first propose a stronger defense mechanism based on capsule networks which combines three detection mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art detection performance on both standard and defense-aware attacks. We then show that undetected attacks against our defense are often classified as the adversarial target class by performing a human study where participants are asked to label the class of images produced by the attack. These attack images thus can no longer be called adversarial, as our network classifies them the same way as humans do.
01	We study the use of hypermodels to represent epistemic uncertainty and guide exploration.This generalizes and extends the use of ensembles to approximate Thompson sampling. The computational cost of training an ensemble grows with its size, and as such, prior work has typically been limited to ensembles with tens of elements. We show that alternative hypermodels can enjoy dramatic efficiency gains, enabling behavior that would otherwise require hundreds or thousands of elements, and even succeed in situations where ensemble methods fail to learn regardless of size.This allows more accurate approximation of Thompson sampling as well as use of more sophisticated exploration schemes.  In particular, we consider an approximate form of information-directed sampling and demonstrate performance gains relative to Thompson sampling.  As alternatives to ensembles, we consider linear and neural network hypermodels, also known as hypernetworks.We prove that, with neural network base models, a linear hypermodel can represent essentially any distribution over functions, and as such, hypernetworks do not extend what can be represented.
10	First-order adaptive optimization algorithms such as Adam play an important role in modern deep learning due to their super fast convergence speed in solving large scale optimization problems. However, Adam's non-convergence behavior and regrettable generalization ability make it fall into a love-hate relationship to deep learning community. Previous studies on Adam and its variants (refer as Adam-Type algorithms) mainly rely on theoretical regret bound analysis, which overlook the natural characteristic reside in such algorithms and limit our thinking. In this paper, we aim at seeking a different interpretation of Adam-Type algorithms so that we can intuitively comprehend and improve them. The way we chose is based on a traditional online convex optimization algorithm scheme known as mirror descent method. By bridging Adam and mirror descent, we receive a clear map of the functionality of each part in Adam. In addition, this new angle brings us a new insight on identifying the non-convergence issue of Adam. Moreover, we provide new variant of Adam-Type algorithm, namely AdamAL which can naturally mitigate the non-convergence issue of Adam and improve its performance. We further conduct experiments on various popular deep learning tasks and models, and the results are quite promising.
01	Recent Transformer-based models such as Transformer-XL and BERT have achieved huge success on various natural language processing tasks. However, contextualized embeddings at the output layer of these powerful models tend to degenerate and occupy an anisotropic cone in the vector space, which is called the representation degeneration problem. In this paper, we propose a novel spectrum control approach to address this degeneration problem. The core idea of our method is to directly guide the spectra training of the output embedding matrix with a slow-decaying singular value prior distribution through a reparameterization framework. We show that our proposed method encourages isotropy of the learned word representations while maintains the modeling power of these contextual neural models. We further provide a theoretical analysis and insight on the benefit of modeling singular value distribution. We demonstrate that our spectrum control method outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-XL modeling for language model, and various Transformer-based models for machine translation, on common benchmark datasets for these tasks.
01	As Machine Learning (ML) gets applied to security-critical or sensitive domains, there is a growing need for integrity and privacy for outsourced ML computations. A pragmatic solution comes from Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which use hardware and software protections to isolate sensitive computations from the untrusted software stack. However, these isolation guarantees come at a price in performance, compared to untrusted alternatives. This paper initiates the study of high performance execution of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in TEEs by efficiently partitioning DNN computations between trusted and untrusted devices. Building upon an efficient outsourcing scheme for matrix multiplication, we propose Slalom, a framework that securely delegates execution of all linear layers in a DNN from a TEE (e.g., Intel SGX or Sanctum) to a faster, yet untrusted, co-located processor. We evaluate Slalom by running DNNs in an Intel SGX enclave, which selectively delegates work to an untrusted GPU. For canonical DNNs (VGG16, MobileNet and ResNet variants) we obtain 6x to 20x increases in throughput for verifiable inference, and 4x to 11x for verifiable and private inference.
10	Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is an extremely useful component of modern neural network architectures, enabling optimization using higher learning rates and achieving faster convergence. In this paper, we use mean-field theory to analytically quantify the impact of BatchNorm on the geometry of the loss landscape for multi-layer networks consisting of fully-connected and convolutional layers. We show that it has a flattening effect on the loss landscape, as quantified by the maximum eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix. These findings are then used to justify the use of larger learning rates for networks that use BatchNorm, and we provide quantitative characterization of the maximal allowable learning rate to ensure convergence. Experiments support our theoretically predicted maximum learning rate, and furthermore suggest that networks with smaller values of the BatchNorm parameter achieve lower loss after the same number of epochs of training.
10	Current machine learning algorithms can be easily fooled by adversarial examples. One possible solution path is to make models that use confidence thresholding to avoid making mistakes. Such models refuse to make a prediction when they are not confident of their answer. We propose to evaluate such models in terms of tradeoff curves with the goal of high success rate on clean examples and low failure rate on adversarial examples. Existing untargeted attacks developed for models that do not use confidence thresholding tend to underestimate such models' vulnerability. We propose the MaxConfidence family of attacks, which are optimal in a variety of theoretical settings, including one realistic setting: attacks against linear models. Experiments show the attack attains good results in practice. We show that simple defenses are able to perform well on MNIST but not on CIFAR, contributing further to previous calls that MNIST should be retired as a benchmarking dataset for adversarial robustness research.  We release code for these evaluations as part of the cleverhans (Papernot et al 2018) library  (ICLR reviewers should be careful not to look at who contributed these features to cleverhans to avoid de-anonymizing this submission).
10	Presence of bias and confounding effects is inarguably one of the most critical challenges in machine learning applications that has alluded to pivotal debates in the recent years. Such challenges range from spurious associations of confounding variables in medical studies to the bias of race in gender or face recognition systems. One solution is to enhance datasets and organize them such that they do not reflect biases, which is a cumbersome and intensive task. The alternative is to make use of available data and build models considering these biases. Traditional statistical methods apply straightforward techniques such as residualization or stratification to precomputed features to account for confounding variables. However, these techniques are not in general applicable to end-to-end deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a method based on the adversarial training strategy to learn discriminative features unbiased and invariant to the confounder(s). This is enabled by incorporating a new adversarial loss function that encourages a vanished correlation between the bias and learned features. We apply our method to a synthetic, a medical diagnosis, and a gender classification (Gender Shades) dataset. Our results show that the learned features by our method not only result in superior prediction performance but also are uncorrelated with the bias or confounder variables. The code is available at http://blinded_for_review/.
10	This paper handles a challenging problem, unseen attribute-object pair recognition, which asks a model to simultaneously recognize the attribute type and the object type of a given image while this attribute-object pair is not included in the training set. In the past years, the conventional classifier-based methods, which recognize unseen attribute-object pairs by composing separately-trained attribute classifiers and object classifiers, are strongly frustrated. Different from conventional methods, we propose a generative model with a visual pathway and a linguistic pathway. In each pathway, the attractor network is involved to learn the intrinsic feature representation to explore the inner relationship between the attribute and the object. With the learned features in both pathways, the unseen attribute-object pair is recognized by finding out the pair whose linguistic feature closely matches the visual feature of the given image. On two public datasets, our model achieves impressive experiment results, notably outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.
01	The data stream model is a fundamental model for processing massive data sets with limited memory and fast processing time. Recently Hsu et al. (2019) incorporated machine learning techniques into the data stream model in order to learn relevant patterns in the input data. Such techniques were encapsulated by training an oracle to predict item frequencies in the streaming model. In this paper we explore the full power of such an oracle, showing that it can be applied to a wide array of problems in data streams, sometimes resulting in the first optimal bounds for such problems. Namely, we apply the oracle to counting distinct elements on the difference of streams, estimating frequency moments, estimating cascaded aggregates, and estimating moments of geometric data streams. For the distinct elements problem, we obtain the first memory-optimal algorithms. For estimating the $p$-th frequency moment for $0 < p < 2$ we obtain the first algorithms with optimal update time. For estimating the $p$-the frequency moment for $p > 2$ we obtain a quadratic saving in memory. We empirically validate our results, demonstrating also our improvements in practice. 
10	The paper proposes and demonstrates a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architecture to identify users with disguised face attempting a fraudulent ATM transaction. The recent introduction of Disguised Face Identification (DFI) framework proves the applicability of deep neural networks for this very problem. All the ATMs nowadays incorporate a hidden camera in them and capture the footage of their users. However, it is impossible for the police to track down the impersonators with disguised faces from the ATM footage. The proposed deep convolutional neural network is trained to identify, in real time, whether the user in the captured image is trying to cloak his identity or not. The output of the DCNN is then reported to the ATM to take appropriate steps and prevent the swindler from completing the transaction. The network is trained using a dataset of images captured in similar situations as of an ATM. The comparatively low background clutter in the images enables the network to demonstrate high accuracy in feature extraction and classification for all the different disguises.
10	In this paper, a new intrinsic reward generation method for sparse-reward reinforcement learning is proposed based on an ensemble of dynamics models. In the proposed method, the mixture of multiple dynamics models is used to approximate the true unknown transition probability, and the intrinsic reward is designed as the minimum of the surprise seen from each dynamics model to the mixture of the dynamics models. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed intrinsic reward generation method, a working algorithm is constructed by combining the proposed intrinsic reward generation method with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Numerical results show that for representative locomotion tasks, the proposed model-ensemble-based intrinsic reward generation method outperforms the previous methods based on a single dynamics model.
10	The Triplet Loss approach to Distance Metric Learning is defined by the strategy to select triplets and the loss function through which those triplets are optimized.  During optimization, two especially important cases are easy positive and hard negative mining which consider, the closest example of the same and different classes.  We characterize how triplets behave based during optimization as a function of these similarities, and highlight that these important cases have technical problems where standard gradient descent behaves poorly, pulling the negative example closer and/or pushing the positive example farther away.  We derive an updated loss function that fixes these problems and shows improvements to the state of the art for CUB, CAR, SOP, In-Shop Clothes datasets.
01	Deep generative models have been successfully used to learn representations for high-dimensional discrete spaces by representing discrete objects as sequences and employing powerful sequence-based deep models. Unfortunately, these sequence-based models often produce invalid sequences: sequences which do not represent any underlying discrete structure; invalid sequences hinder the utility of such models. As a step towards solving this problem, we propose to learn a deep recurrent validator model, which can estimate whether a partial sequence can function as the beginning of a full, valid sequence. This validator provides insight as to how individual sequence elements influence the validity of the overall sequence, and can be used to constrain sequence based models to generate valid sequences — and thus faithfully model discrete objects. Our approach is inspired by reinforcement learning, where an oracle which can evaluate validity of complete sequences provides a sparse reward signal. We demonstrate its effectiveness as a generative model of Python 3 source code for mathematical expressions, and in improving the ability of a variational autoencoder trained on SMILES strings to decode valid molecular structures.
10	Recently, various networks that operate directly on point clouds have been proposed. It is of interest to us what features are utilized in those classifiers for their predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visualize important features used in classification decisions from point cloud networks. Following ideas in visualizing 2-D convolutional networks, our approach is based on gradually smoothing parts of the point cloud to remove certain shape features, and then evaluating the resulting point cloud on the original network to see whether the performance has dropped or remained the same. From these it can be seen whether certain parts are important to the point cloud classification. A main technical contribution of the paper is to propose an algorithm for smoothing point cloud shapes based on moving least squares and curvature flow. This algorithm can smoothly transition from the original point cloud to a either a uniform sphere, or a disk if the original shape is on a plane. With this algorithm, we can obtain a saliency map by adapting the Integrated-Gradients Optimized Saliency (I-GOS) algorithm, a state-of-the-art perturbation-based visualization techniques, to 3-D shapes. Experiment results revealed insights into these classifiers.
01	Large deep neural networks are powerful, but exhibit undesirable behaviors such as memorization and sensitivity to adversarial examples. In this work, we propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels.  By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples.  Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures.  We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt labels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the training of generative adversarial networks.
10	Measuring visual (dis)similarity between two or more instances within a data distribution is a fundamental task in many applications, specially in image retrieval. Theoretically, non-metric distances are able to generate a more complex and accurate similarity model than metric distances, provided that the non-linear data distribution is precisely captured by the similarity model. In this work, we analyze a simple approach for deep learning networks to be used as an approximation of non-metric similarity functions and we study how these models generalize across different image retrieval datasets.
10	"A significant challenge for the practical application of reinforcement learning toreal world problems is the need to specify an oracle reward function that correctly defines a task. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) seeks to avoid this challenge by instead inferring a reward function from expert behavior.  While appealing, it can be impractically expensive to collect datasets of demonstrations that cover the variation common in the real world (e.g. opening any type of door). Thus in practice, IRL must commonly be performed with only a limited set of demonstrations where it can be exceedingly difficult to unambiguously recover a reward function. In this work, we exploit the insight that demonstrations from other tasks can be used to constrain the set of possible reward functions by learning a ""prior"" that is specifically optimized for the ability to infer expressive reward functions from limited numbers of demonstrations.  We demonstrate that our method can efficiently recover rewards from images for novel tasks and provide intuition as to how our approach is analogous to learning a prior."
10	Quantum computers promise significant advantages over classical computers for a number of different applications. We show that the complete loss function landscape of a neural network can be represented as the quantum state output by a quantum computer. We demonstrate this explicitly for a binary neural network and, further, show how a quantum computer can train the network by manipulating this state using a well-known algorithm known as quantum amplitude amplification. We further show that with minor adaptation, this method can also represent the meta-loss landscape of a number of neural network architectures simultaneously. We search this meta-loss landscape with the same method to simultaneously train and design a binary neural network. 
10	Deep Neural Networks, being memory and computation intensive, are a challenge to deploy in smaller devices. Numerous quantization techniques have been proposed to reduce the inference latency/memory consumption. However, these techniques impose a large overhead on the training procedure or need to change the training process. We present a non-intrusive quantization technique based on re-training the full precision model, followed by directly optimizing the corresponding binary model. The quantization training process takes no longer than the original training process. We also propose a new loss function to regularize the weights, resulting in reduced quantization error. Combining both help us achieve full precision accuracy on CIFAR dataset using binary quantization. We also achieve full precision accuracy on WikiText-2 using 2 bit quantization. Comparable results are also shown for ImageNet. We also present a 1.5 bits hybrid model exceeding the performance of TWN LSTM model for WikiText-2.
10	Policy gradient algorithms in reinforcement learning optimize the policy directly and rely on efficiently sampling an environment. However, while most sampling procedures are based solely on sampling the agent's policy, other measures directly accessible through these algorithms could be used to improve sampling before each policy update. Following this line of thoughts, we propose the use of SAUNA, a method where transitions are rejected from the gradient updates if they do not meet a particular criterion, and kept otherwise. This criterion, the fraction of variance explained Vex, is a measure of the discrepancy between a model and actual samples. In this work, Vex is used to evaluate the impact each transition will have on learning: this criterion refines sampling and improves the policy gradient algorithm. In this paper: (a) We introduce and explore Vex, the criterion used for denoising policy gradient updates. (b) We conduct experiments across a variety of benchmark environments, including standard continuous control problems. Our results show better performance with SAUNA. (c) We investigate why Vex provides a reliable assessment for the selection of samples that will positively impact learning. (d) We show how this criterion can work as a dynamic tool to adjust the ratio between exploration and exploitation.
10	Formal verification of machine learning models has attracted attention recently, and significant progress has been made on proving simple properties like robustness to small perturbations of the input features. In this context, it has also been observed that folding the verification procedure into training makes it easier to train verifiably robust models. In this paper, we extend the applicability of verified training by extending it to (1) recurrent neural network architectures and (2) complex specifications that go beyond simple adversarial robustness, particularly specifications that capture temporal properties like requiring that a robot periodically visits a charging station or that a language model always produces sentences of bounded length. Experiments show that while models trained using standard training often violate desired specifications, our verified training method produces models that both perform well (in terms of test error or reward) and can be shown to be provably consistent with specifications.
10	We propose a framework for defining a Boolean algebra over the space of tasks. This allows us to formulate new tasks in terms of the negation, disjunction and conjunction of a set of base tasks. We then show that by learning goal-oriented value functions and restricting the transition dynamics of the tasks, an agent can solve these new tasks with no further learning. We prove that by composing these value functions in specific ways, we immediately recover the optimal policies for all tasks expressible under the Boolean algebra. We verify our approach in two domains, including a high-dimensional video game environment requiring function approximation, where an agent first learns a set of base skills, and then composes them to solve a super-exponential number of new tasks. 
10	Learning representations of data is an important issue in machine learning. Though GAN has led to significant improvements in the data representations, it still has several problems such as unstable training, hidden manifold of data, and huge computational overhead. GAN tends to produce the data simply without any information about the manifold of the data, which hinders from controlling desired features to generate. Moreover, most of GAN’s have a large size of manifold, resulting in poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN to control the latent semantic representation, called LSC-GAN, which allows us to produce desired data to generate and learns a representation of the data efficiently. Unlike the conventional GAN models with hidden distribution of latent space, we define the distributions explicitly in advance that are trained to generate the data based on the corresponding features by inputting the latent variables that follow the distribution. As the larger scale of latent space caused by deploying various distributions in one latent space makes training unstable while maintaining the dimension of latent space, we need to separate the process of defining the distributions explicitly and operation of generation. We prove that a VAE is proper for the former and modify a loss function of VAE to map the data into the pre-defined latent space so as to locate the reconstructed data as close to the input data according to its characteristics. Moreover, we add the KL divergence to the loss function of LSC-GAN to include this process. The decoder of VAE, which generates the data with the corresponding features from the pre-defined latent space, is used as the generator of the LSC-GAN. Several experiments on the CelebA dataset are conducted to verify the usefulness of the proposed method to generate desired data stably and efficiently, achieving a high compression ratio that can hold about 24 pixels of information in each dimension of latent space. Besides, our model learns the reverse of features such as not laughing (rather frowning) only with data of ordinary and smiling facial expression.
10	Inspired by the observation that humans are able to process videos efficiently by only paying attention when and where it is needed, we propose a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism for video-based action recognition. For spatial attention, we learn a saliency mask to allow the model to focus on the most salient parts of the feature maps. For temporal attention, we employ a soft temporal attention mechanism to identify the most relevant frames from an input video. Further, we propose a set of regularizers that ensure that our attention mechanism attends to coherent regions in space and time. Our model is efficient, as it proposes a separable spatio-temporal mechanism for video attention, while being able to identify important parts of the video both spatially and temporally.  We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on three public video action recognition datasets. The proposed approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on all of them, including the new large-scale Moments in Time dataset. Furthermore, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our model's ability to accurately localize discriminative regions spatially and critical frames temporally. This is despite our model only being trained with per video classification labels. 
10	We propose and evaluate new techniques for compressing and speeding up dense matrix multiplications as found in the fully connected and recurrent layers of neural networks for embedded large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR). For compression, we introduce and study a trace norm regularization technique for training low rank factored versions of matrix multiplications. Compared to standard low rank training, we show that our method leads to good accuracy versus number of parameter trade-offs and can be used to speed up training of large models. For speedup, we enable faster inference on ARM processors through new open sourced kernels optimized for small batch sizes, resulting in 3x to 7x speed ups over the widely used gemmlowp library. Beyond LVCSR, we expect our techniques and kernels to be more generally applicable to embedded neural networks with large fully connected or recurrent layers.
10	The rise of graph-structured data such as social networks, regulatory networks, citation graphs, and functional brain networks, in combination with resounding success of deep learning in various applications, has brought the interest in generalizing deep learning models to non-Euclidean domains. In this paper, we introduce a new spectral domain convolutional architecture for deep learning on graphs. The core ingredient of our model is a new class of parametric rational complex functions (Cayley polynomials) allowing to efficiently compute spectral filters on graphs that specialize on frequency bands of interest. Our model generates rich spectral filters that are localized in space, scales linearly with the size of the input data for sparsely-connected graphs, and can handle different constructions of Laplacian operators. Extensive experimental results show the superior performance of our approach on spectral image classification, community detection, vertex classification and matrix completion tasks.
10	CapsNet (Capsule Network) was first proposed by Sabour et al. (2017) and lateranother version of CapsNet was proposed by Hinton et al. (2018).  CapsNet hasbeen proved effective in modeling spatial features with much fewer parameters.However, the routing procedures (dynamic routing and EM routing) in both pa-pers are not well incorporated into the whole training process,  and the optimalnumber for the routing procedure has to be found manually.  We propose Gen-eralized GapsNet (G-CapsNet) to overcome this disadvantages by incorporatingthe routing procedure into the optimization.  We implement two versions of G-CapsNet (fully-connected and convolutional) on CAFFE (Jia et al. (2014)) andevaluate them by testing the accuracy on MNIST & CIFAR10, the robustness towhite-box & black-box attack, and the generalization ability on GAN-generatedsynthetic images.  We also explore the scalability of G-CapsNet by constructinga relatively deep G-CapsNet.   The experiment shows that G-CapsNet has goodgeneralization ability and scalability. 
10	Many deep reinforcement learning algorithms contain inductive biases that sculpt the agent's objective and its interface to the environment. These inductive biases can take many forms, including domain knowledge and pretuned hyper-parameters. In general, there is a trade-off between generality and performance when we use such biases. Stronger biases can lead to faster learning, but weaker biases can potentially lead to more general algorithms that work on a wider class of problems.This trade-off is relevant because these inductive biases are not free; substantial effort may be required to obtain relevant domain knowledge or to tune hyper-parameters effectively. In this paper, we re-examine several domain-specific components that modify the agent's objective and environmental interface.  We investigated whether the performance deteriorates when all these fixed components are replaced with adaptive solutions from the literature.  In our experiments, performance sometimes decreased with the adaptive components, as one might expect when comparing to components crafted for the domain, but sometimes the adaptive components performed better. We then investigated the main benefit of having fewer domain-specific components, by comparing the learning performance of the two systems on a different set of continuous control problems, without additional tuning of either system.  As hypothesized, the system with adaptive components performed better on many of the tasks.
10	Time series with missing data constitute an important setting for machine learning. The most successful prior approaches for modeling such time series are based on recurrent neural networks that learn to impute unobserved values and then treat the imputed values as observed. We start by introducing Recursive Input and State Estimation (RISE), a general framework that encompasses such prior approaches as specific instances. Since RISE instances tend to suffer from poor long-term performance as errors are amplified in feedback loops, we propose Direct Input and State Estimation (DISE), a novel framework in which input and state representations are learned from observed data only. The key to DISE is to include time information in representation learning, which enables the direct modeling of arbitrary future time steps by effectively skipping over missing values, rather than imputing them, thus overcoming the error amplification encountered by RISE methods. We benchmark instances of both frameworks on two forecasting tasks, observing that DISE achieves state-of-the-art performance on both.
10	We consider the problem of balancing exploration and exploitation in sequential decision making problems. This trade-off naturally lends itself to probabilistic modelling. For a probabilistic approach to be effective, considering uncertainty about all immediate and long-term consequences of agent's actions is vital. An estimate of such uncertainty can be leveraged to guide exploration even in situations where the agent needs to perform a potentially long sequence of actions before reaching an under-explored area of the environment. This observation was made by the authors of the Uncertainty Bellman Equation model (O'Donoghue et al., 2018), which explicitly considers full marginal uncertainty for each decision the agent faces. However, their model still considers a fully factorised posterior over the consequences of each action, meaning that dependencies vital for correlated long-term exploration are ignored. We go a step beyond and develop Successor Uncertainties, a probabilistic model for the state-action value function of a Markov Decision Process with a non-factorised covariance. We demonstrate how this leads to greatly improved performance on classic tabular exploration benchmarks and show strong performance of our method on a subset of Atari baselines. Overall, Successor Uncertainties provides a better probabilistic model for temporal difference learning at a similar computational cost to its predecessors.
10	A key feature of intelligent behavior is the ability to learn abstract strategies that transfer to unfamiliar problems. Therefore, we present a novel architecture, based on memory-augmented networks, that is inspired by the von Neumann and Harvard architectures of modern computers. This architecture enables the learning of abstract algorithmic solutions via Evolution Strategies in a reinforcement learning setting. Applied to Sokoban, sliding block puzzle and robotic manipulation tasks, we show that the architecture can learn algorithmic solutions with strong generalization and abstraction: scaling to arbitrary task configurations and complexities, and being independent of both the data representation and the task domain.
10	Generalization from limited examples, usually studied under the umbrella of meta-learning, equips learning techniques with the ability to adapt quickly in dynamical environments and proves to be an essential aspect of lifelong learning. In this paper, we introduce the Projective Subspace Networks (PSN), a deep learning paradigm that learns non-linear embeddings from limited supervision. In contrast to previous studies, the embedding in PSN deems samples of a given class to form an affine subspace. We will show that such modeling leads to robust solutions, yielding competitive results on supervised and semi-supervised few-shot classification. Moreover, our PSN approach has the ability of end-to-end learning. In contrast to previous works, our projective subspace can be thought of as a richer representation capturing higher-order information datapoints for modeling new concepts.
10	Obtaining reliable uncertainty estimates of neural network predictions is a long standing challenge. Bayesian neural networks have been proposed as a solution, but it remains open how to specify their prior. In particular, the common practice of a standard normal prior in weight space imposes only weak regularities, causing the function posterior to possibly generalize in unforeseen ways on inputs outside of the training distribution. We propose noise contrastive priors (NCPs) to obtain reliable uncertainty estimates. The key idea is to train the model to output high uncertainty for data points outside of the training distribution. NCPs do so using an input prior, which adds noise to the inputs of the current mini batch, and an output prior, which is a wide distribution given these inputs. NCPs are compatible with any model that can output uncertainty estimates, are easy to scale, and yield reliable uncertainty estimates throughout training. Empirically, we show that NCPs prevent overfitting outside of the training distribution and result in uncertainty estimates that are useful for active learning. We demonstrate the scalability of our method on the flight delays data set, where we significantly improve upon previously published results.
10	We propose a novel framework to generate clean video frames from a single motion-blurred image.While a broad range of literature focuses on recovering a single image from a blurred image, in this work, we tackle a more challenging task i.e.  video restoration from a blurred image. We formulate video restoration from a single blurred image as an inverse problem by setting clean image sequence and their respective motion as latent factors, and the blurred image as an observation. Our framework is based on an encoder-decoder structure with spatial transformer network modules to restore a video sequence and its underlying motion in an end-to-end manner. We design a loss function and regularizers with complementary properties to stabilize the training and analyze variant models of the proposed network. The effectiveness and transferability of our network are highlighted through a large set of experiments on two different types of datasets: camera rotation blurs generated from panorama scenes and dynamic motion blurs in high speed videos. Our code and models will be publicly available. 
10	The non-convex nature of the loss landscape of deep neural networks (DNN) lends them the intuition that over the course of training, stochastic optimization algorithms explore different regions of the loss surface by entering and escaping many local minima due to the noise induced by mini-batches. But is this really the case? This question couples the geometry of the DNN loss landscape with how stochastic optimization algorithms like SGD interact with it during training. Answering this question may help us qualitatively understand the dynamics of deep neural network optimization. We show evidence through qualitative and quantitative experiments that mini-batch SGD rarely crosses barriers during DNN optimization. As we show, the mini-batch induced noise helps SGD explore different regions of the loss surface using a seemingly different mechanism. To complement this finding, we also investigate the qualitative reason behind the slowing down of this exploration when using larger batch-sizes. We show this happens because gradients from larger batch-sizes align more with the top eigenvectors of the Hessian, which makes SGD oscillate in the proximity of the parameter initialization, thus preventing exploration.
10	Many computer vision applications require solving multiple tasks in real-time. A neural network can be trained to solve multiple tasks simultaneously using 'multi-task learning'. This saves computation at inference time as only a single network needs to be evaluated. Unfortunately, this often leads to inferior overall performance as task objectives compete, which consequently poses the question: which tasks should and should not be learned together in one network when employing multi-task learning? We systematically study task cooperation and competition and propose a framework for assigning tasks to a few neural networks such that cooperating tasks are computed by the same neural network, while competing tasks are computed by different networks. Our framework offers a time-accuracy trade-off and can produce better accuracy using less inference time than not only a single large multi-task neural network but also many single-task networks.
01	In contrast to fully connected networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve efficiency by learning weights associated with local filters with a finite spatial extent. An implication of this is that a filter may know what it is looking at, but not where it is positioned in the image. Information concerning absolute position is inherently useful, and it is reasonable to assume that deep CNNs may implicitly learn to encode this information if there is a means to do so. In this paper, we test this hypothesis revealing the surprising degree of absolute position information that is encoded in commonly used neural networks. A comprehensive set of experiments show the validity of this hypothesis and shed light on how and where this information is represented while offering clues to where positional information is derived from in deep CNNs.
10	"Creating a useful representation of the world takes more than just rote memorization of individual data samples. This is because fundamentally, we use our internal representation to plan, to solve problems, and to navigate the world. For a representation to be amenable to planning, it is critical for it to embody some notion of optimality. A representation learning objective that explicitly considers some form of planning should generate representations which are more computationally valuable than those that memorize samples. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Plan2Vec}, an unsupervised representation learning objective inspired by value-based reinforcement learning methods. By abstracting away low-level control with a learned local metric, we show that it is possible to learn plannable representations that inform long-range structures, entirely passively from high-dimensional sequential datasets without supervision. A latent space is learned by playing an ``Imagined Planning Game"" on the graph formed by the data points, using a local metric function trained contrastively from context. We show that the global metric on this learned embedding can be used to plan with O(1) complexity by linear interpolation. This exponential speed-up is critical for planning with a learned representation on any problem containing non-trivial global topology. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Plan2Vec on simulated toy tasks from both proprioceptive and image states, as well as two real-world image datasets, showing that Plan2Vec can effectively plan using learned representations. Additional results and videos can be found at \url{https://sites.google.com/view/plan2vec}."
10	We introduce a unified probabilistic approach for deep continual learning based on variational Bayesian inference with open set recognition. Our model combines a joint probabilistic encoder with a generative model and a linear classifier that get shared across tasks. The open set recognition bounds the approximate posterior by fitting regions of high density on the basis of correctly classified data points and balances open set detection with recognition errors. Catastrophic forgetting is significantly alleviated through generative replay, where the open set recognition is used to sample from high density areas of the class specific posterior and reject statistical outliers. Our approach naturally allows for forward and backward transfer while maintaining past knowledge without the necessity of storing old data, regularization or inferring task labels. We demonstrate compelling results in the challenging scenario of incrementally expanding the single-head classifier for both class incremental visual and audio classification tasks, as well as incremental learning of datasets across modalities.
10	"We introduce `""Talk The Walk"", the first large-scale dialogue dataset grounded in action and perception. The task involves two agents (a 'guide' and a 'tourist') that communicate via natural language in order to achieve a common goal: having the tourist navigate to a given target location. The task and dataset, which are described in detail, are challenging and their full solution is an open problem that we pose to the community. We (i) focus on the task of tourist localization and develop the novel Masked Attention for Spatial Convolutions (MASC) mechanism that allows for grounding tourist utterances into the guide's map, (ii) show it yields significant improvements for both emergent and natural language communication, and (iii) using this method, we establish non-trivial baselines on the full task. "
01	We frame Question Answering (QA) as a Reinforcement Learning task, an approach that we call Active Question Answering. We propose an agent that sits between the user and a black box QA system and learns to reformulate questions to elicit the best possible answers. The agent probes the system with, potentially many, natural language reformulations of an initial question and aggregates the returned evidence to yield the best answer. The reformulation system is trained end-to-end to maximize answer quality using policy gradient. We evaluate on SearchQA, a dataset of complex questions extracted from Jeopardy!. The agent outperforms a state-of-the-art base model, playing the role of the environment, and other benchmarks.We also analyze the language that the agent has learned while interacting with the question answering system. We find that successful question reformulations look quite different from natural language paraphrases. The agent is able to discover non-trivial reformulation strategies that resemble classic information retrieval techniques such as term re-weighting (tf-idf) and stemming.
10	Various machine learning tasks can benefit from access to external information of different modalities, such as text and images. Recent work has focused on learning architectures with large memories capable of storing this knowledge. We propose augmenting Transformer neural networks with KNN-based Information Fetching (KIF) modules. Each KIF module learns a read operation to access fixed external knowledge. We apply these modules to generative dialogue modeling, a challenging task where information must be flexibly retrieved and incorporated to maintain the topic and flow of conversation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by identifying relevant knowledge from Wikipedia, images, and human-written dialogue utterances, and show that leveraging this retrieved information improves model performance, measured by automatic and human evaluation.
10	Many recently proposed methods for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can be formulated as bilevel optimization. For efficient implementation, its solution requires approximations of second-order methods. In this paper, we demonstrate that gradient errors caused by such approximation leads to suboptimality, in that such a procedure fails to converge to a (locally) optimal solution. To remedy this problem, this paper proposes MiLeNAS, a mixed-level reformulation for Neural Architecture Search that can be optimized more reliably. It is shown that even when using a simple first-order method on mixed-level formulation, MiLeNAS can achieve lower validation error for NAS problems. Consequently, architectures obtained by our method achieve consistently higher accuracies than those obtained from bilevel optimization. Moreover, the use of first-order updates in our method also leads to faster training. Extensive experiments within convolutional architecture search space validate the effectiveness of our approach. 
10	There are many ways to translate a sentence into another language. Explicit modeling of such uncertainty may enable better model fitting to the data and it may enable users to express a preference for how to translate a piece of content. Latent variable models are a natural way to represent uncertainty. Prior work investigated the use of multivariate continuous and discrete latent variables, but their interpretation and use for generating a diverse set of hypotheses have been elusive. In this work, we drastically simplify the model, using just a single multinomial latent variable. The resulting mixture of experts model can be trained efficiently via hard-EM and can generate a diverse set of hypothesis by parallel greedy decoding. We perform extensive experiments on three WMT benchmark datasets that have multiple human references, and we show that our model provides a better trade-off between quality and diversity of generations compared to all baseline methods.\footnote{Code to reproduce this work is available at: anonymized URL.}
10	Image generation has been successfully cast as an autoregressive sequence generationor transformation problem. Recent work has shown that self-attention isan effective way of modeling textual sequences. In this work, we generalize arecently proposed model architecture based on self-attention, the Transformer, toa sequence modeling formulation of image generation with a tractable likelihood.By restricting the self-attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods wesignificantly increase the size of images the model can process in practice, despitemaintaining significantly larger receptive fields per layer than typical convolutionalneural networks. We propose another extension of self-attention allowing itto efficiently take advantage of the two-dimensional nature of images.While conceptually simple, our generative models trained on two image data setsare competitive with or significantly outperform the current state of the art in autoregressiveimage generation on two different data sets, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.We also present results on image super-resolution with a large magnification ratio,applying an encoder-decoder configuration of our architecture. In a humanevaluation study, we show that our super-resolution models improve significantlyover previously published autoregressive super-resolution models. Images theygenerate fool human observers three times more often than the previous state ofthe art.
10	To gain high rewards in muti-agent scenes, it is sometimes necessary to understand other agents and make corresponding optimal decisions. We can solve these tasks by first building models for other agents and then finding the optimal policy with these models. To get an accurate model, many observations are needed and this can be sample-inefficient. What's more, the learned model and policy can overfit to current agents and cannot generalize if the other agents are replaced by new agents. In many practical situations, each agent we face can be considered as a sample from a population with a fixed but unknown distribution. Thus we can treat the task against some specific agents as a task sampled from a task distribution. We apply meta-learning method to build models and learn policies. Therefore when new agents come, we can adapt to them efficiently. Experiments on grid games show that our method can quickly get high rewards.
10	To continuously improve quality and reflect changes in data, machine learning-based services have to regularly re-train and update their core models. In the setting of language models, we show that a comparative analysis of model snapshots before and after an update can reveal a surprising amount of detailed information about the changes in the data used for training before and after the update.We discuss the privacy implications of our findings, propose mitigation strategies and evaluate their effect.
10	Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) requires a large number of trials to learn a good policy, especially in environments with sparse rewards. We explore a method to improve the sample efficiency when we have access to demonstrations. Our approach, Backplay, uses a single demonstration to construct a curriculum for a given task. Rather than starting each training episode in the environment's fixed initial state, we start the agent near the end of the demonstration and move the starting point backwards during the course of training until we reach the initial state. Our contributions are that we analytically characterize the types of environments where Backplay can improve training speed, demonstrate the effectiveness of Backplay both in large grid worlds and a complex four player zero-sum game (Pommerman), and show that Backplay compares favorably to other competitive methods known to improve sample efficiency. This includes reward shaping, behavioral cloning, and reverse curriculum generation.
10	Deep neural network image classifiers are reported to be susceptible to adversarial evasion attacks, which use carefully crafted images created to mislead a classifier. Recently, various kinds of adversarial attack methods have been proposed, most of which focus on adding small perturbations to input images. Despite the success of existing approaches, the way to generate realistic adversarial images with small perturbations remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we aim to address this problem by proposing a novel adversarial method, which generates adversarial examples by imposing not only perturbations but also spatial distortions on input images, including scaling, rotation, shear, and translation. As humans are less susceptible to small spatial distortions, the proposed approach can produce visually more realistic attacks with smaller perturbations, able to deceive classifiers without affecting human predictions. We learn our method by amortized techniques with neural networks and generate adversarial examples efficiently by a forward pass of the networks. Extensive experiments on attacking different types of non-robustified classifiers and robust classifiers with defence show that our method has state-of-the-art performance in comparison with advanced attack parallels.
10	Knowledge extraction techniques are used to convert neural networks into symbolic descriptions with the objective of producing more comprehensible learning models. The central challenge is to find an explanation which is more comprehensible than the original model while still representing that model faithfully. The distributed nature of deep networks has led many to believe that the hidden features of a neural network cannot be explained by logical descriptions simple enough to be understood by humans, and that decompositional knowledge extraction should be abandoned in favour of other methods. In this paper we examine this question systematically by proposing a knowledge extraction method using \textit{M-of-N} rules which allows us to map the complexity/accuracy landscape of rules describing hidden features in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experiments reported in this paper show that the shape of this landscape reveals an optimal trade off between comprehensibility and accuracy, showing that each latent variable has an optimal \textit{M-of-N} rule to describe its behaviour. We find that the rules with optimal tradeoff in the first and final layer have a high degree of explainability whereas the rules with the optimal tradeoff in the second and third layer are less explainable. The results shed light on the feasibility of rule extraction from deep networks, and point to the value of decompositional knowledge extraction as a method of explainability.
01	We propose Additive Powers-of-Two~(APoT) quantization, an efficient non-uniform quantization scheme for the bell-shaped and long-tailed distribution of weights and activations in neural networks. By constraining all quantization levels as the sum of Powers-of-Two terms, APoT quantization enjoys high computational efficiency and a good match with the distribution of weights. A simple reparameterization of the clipping function is applied to generate a better-defined gradient for learning the clipping threshold. Moreover, weight normalization is presented to refine the distribution of weights to make the training more stable and consistent. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and is even competitive with the full-precision models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed APoT quantization. For example, our 4-bit quantized ResNet-50 on ImageNet achieves 76.6% top-1 accuracy without bells and whistles; meanwhile, our model reduces 22% computational cost compared with the uniformly quantized counterpart.
10	We point out important problems with the common practice of using the best single model performance for comparing deep learning architectures, and we propose a method that corrects these flaws. Each time a model is trained, one gets a different result due to random factors in the training process, which include random parameter initialization and random data shuffling. Reporting the best single model performance does not appropriately address this stochasticity. We propose a normalized expected best-out-of-n performance (Boo_n) as a way to correct these problems.
10	Despite the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image synthesis, there lacks enough understanding on what networks have learned inside the deep generative representations and how photo-realistic images are able to be composed from random noises. In this work, we show that highly-structured semantic hierarchy emerges from the generative representations as the variation factors for synthesizing scenes. By probing the layer-wise representations with a broad set of visual concepts at different abstraction levels, we are able to quantify the causality between the activations and the semantics occurring in the output image. Such a quantification identifies the human-understandable variation factors learned by GANs to compose scenes. The qualitative and quantitative results suggest that the generative representations learned by GAN are specialized to synthesize different hierarchical semantics: the early layers tend to determine the spatial layout and configuration, the middle layers control the categorical objects, and the later layers finally render the scene attributes as well as color scheme. Identifying such a set of manipulatable latent semantics facilitates semantic scene manipulation.
01	We humans have an innate understanding of the asymmetric progression of time, which we use to efficiently and safely perceive and manipulate our environment. Drawing inspiration from that, we approach the problem of learning an arrow of time in a Markov (Decision) Process. We illustrate how a learned arrow of time can capture salient information about the environment, which in turn can be used to measure reachability, detect side-effects and to obtain an intrinsic reward signal. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm to parameterize the problem at hand and learn an arrow of time with a function approximator (here, a deep neural network). Our empirical results span a selection of discrete and continuous environments, and demonstrate for a class of stochastic processes that the learned arrow of time agrees reasonably well with a well known notion of an arrow of time due to Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto (1998). 
10	Many applications require quickly and repeatedly  solving a certain type of optimization problem, each time with new (but similar) data. However, state of the art general-purpose optimization methods may converge too slowly for real-time use. This shortcoming is addressed by  “learning to optimize” (L2O) schemes, which construct   neural networks from parameterized forms of the update  operations of general-purpose methods. Inferences by each network form solution estimates, and networks are trained to optimize these estimates for a particular distribution of data. This results in task-specific algorithms (e.g., LISTA, ALISTA, and D-LADMM) that can converge order(s) of magnitude faster than general-purpose counterparts.  We provide the first general L2O convergence theory by wrapping all L2O schemes for convex optimization within a single framework. Existing L2O schemes form special cases, and we give a practical guide for applying our L2O framework to other problems. Using safeguarding, our theory proves, as the number of network layers increases, the distance between inferences and the solution set goes to zero, i.e., each cluster point is a solution. Our numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for both existing and new L2O methods. 
10	Large pretrained language models have changed the way researchers approach discriminative natural language understanding tasks, leading to the dominance of approaches that adapt a pretrained model for arbitrary downstream tasks. However, it is an open question how to use similar techniques for language generation. Early results in the encoder-agnostic setting have been mostly negative. In this work, we explore methods for adapting a pretrained language model to arbitrary conditional input. We observe that pretrained transformer models are sensitive to large parameter changes during tuning. Therefore, we propose an adaptation that directly injects arbitrary conditioning into self attention, an approach we call pseudo self attention. Through experiments on four diverse conditional text generation tasks, we show that this encoder-agnostic technique outperforms strong baselines, produces coherent generations, and is data-efficient.
10	Convolutional neural networks memorize part of their training data, which is why strategies such as data augmentation and drop-out are employed to mitigate over- fitting. This paper considers the related question of “membership inference”, where the goal is to determine if an image was used during training. We con- sider membership tests over either ensembles of samples or individual samples.First, we show how to detect if a dataset was used to train a model, and in particular whether some validation images were used at train time. Then, we introduce a new approach to infer membership when a few of the top layers are not available or have been fine-tuned, and show that lower layers still carry information about the training samples. To support our findings, we conduct large-scale experiments on Imagenet and subsets of YFCC-100M with modern architectures such as VGG and Resnet.
10	We propose a framework to model the distribution of sequential data coming froma set of entities connected in a graph with a known topology. The method isbased on a mixture of shared hidden Markov models (HMMs), which are trainedin order to exploit the knowledge of the graph structure and in such a way that theobtained mixtures tend to be sparse. Experiments in different application domainsdemonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the method.
01	We present the perceptor gradients algorithm -- a novel approach to learning symbolic representations based on the idea of decomposing an agent's policy into i) a perceptor network extracting symbols from raw observation data and ii) a task encoding program which maps the input symbols to output actions. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to learn representations that can be directly fed into a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) or a general purpose A* planner. Our experimental results confirm that the perceptor gradients algorithm is able to efficiently learn transferable symbolic representations as well as generate new observations according to a semantically meaningful specification.
10	We propose an approach to generate realistic and high-fidelity stock market data based on generative adversarial networks.We model the order stream as a stochastic process with finite history dependence, and employ a conditional Wasserstein GAN to capture history dependence of orders in a stock market. We test our approach with actual market and synthetic data on a number of different statistics, and find the generated data to be close to real data. 
10	The text generated by neural language models is not as good as the real text. This means that their distributions are different. Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) are used to alleviate it. However, some researchers argue that GAN variants do not work at all. When both sample quality (such as Bleu) and sample diversity (such as self-Bleu) are taken into account, the GAN variants even are worse than a well-adjusted language model. But, Bleu and self-Bleu can not precisely measure this distributional discrepancy. In fact, how to measure the distributional discrepancy between real text and generated text is still an open problem. In this paper, we theoretically propose two metric functions to measure the distributional difference between real text and generated text. Besides that, a method is put forward to estimate them. First, we evaluate language model with these two functions and find the difference is huge. Then, we try several methods to use the detected discrepancy signal to improve the generator. However the difference becomes even bigger than before. Experimenting on two existing language GANs, the distributional discrepancy between real text and generated text increases with more adversarial learning rounds. It demonstrates both of these language GANs fail. 
01	Neuromorphic hardware tends to pose limits on the connectivity of deep networks that one can run on them. But also generic hardware and software implementations of deep learning run more efficiently for sparse networks. Several methods exist for pruning connections of a neural network after it was trained without connectivity constraints. We present an algorithm, DEEP R, that enables us to train directly a sparsely connected neural network. DEEP R automatically rewires the network during supervised training so that connections are there where they are most needed for the task, while its total number is all the time strictly bounded. We demonstrate that DEEP R can be used to train very sparse feedforward and recurrent neural networks on standard benchmark tasks with just a minor loss in performance. DEEP R is based on a rigorous theoretical foundation that views rewiring as stochastic sampling of network configurations from a posterior.
10	High utilization is key to achieve high efficiency for deep neural networks. Existing deep learning frameworks has focused on improving the performance of individual operators but ignored the parallelization between operators. This leads to low device utilization especially for complex deep neural networks (DNNs) with many small operations such as Inception and NASNet. To make complex DNNs more efficient, we need to execute parallely. However, naive greedy schedule leads to much resource contention and do not yield best performance. In this work, we propose Deep Optimal Scheduling (DOS), a general dynamic programming algorithm to find optimal scheduling to improve utilization via parallel execution. Specifically, DOS optimizes the execution for given hardware and inference settings. Our experiments demonstrate that DOS consistently outperform existing deep learning library by 1.2 to 1.4 × on widely used complex DNNs.
10	Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is the task where an agent is commanded to navigate in photo-realistic unknown environments with natural language instructions. Previous research on VLN is primarily conducted on the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset with only English instructions.  The ultimate goal of VLN, however, is to serve people speaking arbitrary languages. Towards multilingual VLN with numerous languages, we collect a cross-lingual R2R dataset, which extends the original benchmark with corresponding Chinese instructions. But it is time-consuming and expensive to collect large-scale human instructions for every existing language. Based on the newly introduced dataset, we propose a general cross-lingual VLN framework to enable instruction-following navigation for different languages. We first explore the possibility of building a cross-lingual agent when no training data of the target language is available. The cross-lingual agent is equipped with a meta-learner to aggregate cross-lingual representations and a visually grounded cross-lingual alignment module to align textual representations of different languages. Under the zero-shot learning scenario, our model shows competitive results even compared to a model trained with all target language instructions. In addition, we introduce an adversarial domain adaption loss to improve the transferring ability of our model when given a certain amount of target language data. Our methods and dataset demonstrate the potentials of building a cross-lingual agent to serve speakers with different languages.
10	The gap between the empirical success of deep learning and the lack of strong theoretical guarantees calls for studying simpler models. By observing that a ReLU neuron is a product of a linear function with a gate (the latter determines whether the neuron is active or not), where both share a jointly trained weight vector, we propose to decouple the two. We introduce GaLU networks — networks in which each neuron is a product of a Linear Unit, defined by a weight vector which is being trained, with a Gate, defined by a different weight vector which is not being trained. Generally speaking, given a base model and a simpler version of it, the two parameters that determine the quality of the simpler version are whether its practical performance is close enough to the base model and whether it is easier to analyze it theoretically. We show that GaLU networks perform similarly to ReLU networks on standard datasets and we initiate a study of their theoretical properties, demonstrating that they are indeed easier to analyze. We believe that further research of GaLU networks may be fruitful for the development of a theory of deep learning.
10	Successfully training deep neural networks often requires either {batch normalization}, appropriate {weight initialization}, both of which come with their own challenges. We propose an alternative, geometrically motivated method for training. Using elementary results from linear programming, we introduce Farkas layers: a method that ensures at least one neuron is active at a given layer. Focusing on residual networks with ReLU activation, we empirically demonstrate a significant improvement in training capacity in the absence of batch normalization or methods of initialization across a broad range of network sizes on benchmark datasets.
10	Visual attention mechanisms have been widely used in image captioning models. In this paper, to better link the image structure with the generated text, we replace the traditional softmax attention mechanism by two alternative sparsity-promoting transformations: sparsemax and Total-Variation Sparse Attention (TVmax). With sparsemax, we obtain sparse attention weights, selecting relevant features.  In order to promote sparsity and encourage fusing of the related adjacent spatial locations, we propose TVmax.  By selecting relevant groups of features, the TVmax transformation improves interpretability. We present results in the Microsoft COCO and Flickr30k datasets, obtaining gains in comparison to softmax.  TVmax outperforms the other compared attention mechanisms in terms of human-rated caption quality and attention relevance.
10	Self-supervision, in which a target task is improved without external supervision, has primarily been explored in settings that assume the availability of additional data. However, in many cases, particularly in healthcare, one may not have access to additional data (labeled or otherwise). In such settings, we hypothesize that self-supervision based solely on the structure of the data at-hand can help. We explore a novel self-supervision framework for time-series data, in which multiple auxiliary tasks (e.g., forecasting) are included to improve overall performance on a sequence-level target task without additional training data. We call this approach limited self-supervision, as we limit ourselves to only the data at-hand. We demonstrate the utility of limited self-supervision on three sequence-level classification tasks, two pertaining to real clinical data and one using synthetic data. Within this framework, we introduce novel forms of self-supervision and demonstrate their utility in improving performance on the target task. Our results indicate that limited self-supervision leads to a consistent improvement over a supervised baseline, across a range of domains. In particular, for the task of identifying atrial fibrillation from small amounts of electrocardiogram data, we observe a nearly 13% improvement in the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) relative to the baseline (AUC-ROC=0.55 vs. AUC-ROC=0.62). Limited self-supervision applied to sequential data can aid in learning intermediate representations, making it particularly applicable in settings where data collection is difficult.
10	Parameter quantization is a popular model compression technique due to its regular form and high compression ratio. In particular, quantization based on binary codes is gaining attention because each quantized bit can be directly utilized for computations without dequantization using look-up tables. Previous attempts, however, only allow for integer numbers of quantization bits, which ends up restricting the search space for compression ratio and accuracy. Moreover, quantization bits are usually obtained by minimizing quantization loss in a local manner that does not directly correspond to minimizing the loss function. In this paper, we propose an encryption algorithm/architecture to compress quantized weights in order to achieve fractional numbers of bits per weight and new compression configurations further optimize accuracy/compression trade-offs. Decryption is implemented using XOR gates added into the neural network model and described as $\tanh(x)$, which enable gradient calculations superior to the straight-through gradient method. We perform experiments using MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet to show that inserting XOR gates learns quantization/encrypted bit decisions through training and obtains high accuracy even for fractional sub 1-bit weights.
10	Face completion is a challenging conditional image synthesis task. This paper proposes controllable and interpretable high-resolution and fast face completion by learning generative adversarial networks (GANs) progressively from low resolution to high resolution. We present structure-aware and frequency-oriented attentive GANs. The proposed structure-aware component leverages off-the-shelf facial landmark detectors and proposes a simple yet effective  method of integrating the detected landmarks in generative learning. It facilitates facial expression transfer together with facial attributes control, and helps regularize the structural consistency in progressive training. The proposed  frequency-oriented attentive module (FOAM) encourages GANs to attend to only finer details in the coarse-to-fine progressive training, thus enabling progressive attention to face structures. The learned FOAMs show a strong pattern of switching its attention from low-frequency to high-frequency signals. In experiments, the proposed method is tested on the CelebA-HQ benchmark. Experiment results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art face completion methods. The proposed method is also fast with mean inference time of 0.54 seconds for images at 1024x1024 resolution (using a Titan Xp GPU).
10	Learning to discover useful skills without a manually-designed reward function would have many applications, yet is still a challenge for reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose Mutual Information-based State-Control (MISC), a new self-supervised Reinforcement Learning approach for learning to control states of interest without any external reward function. We formulate the intrinsic objective as rewarding the skills that maximize the mutual information between the context states and the states of interest. For example, in robotic manipulation tasks, the context states are the robot states and the states of interest are the states of an object. We evaluate our approach for different simulated robotic manipulation tasks from OpenAI Gym. We show that our method is able to learn to manipulate the object, such as pushing and picking up, purely based on the intrinsic mutual information rewards. Furthermore, the pre-trained policy and mutual information discriminator can be used to accelerate learning to achieve high task rewards. Our results show that the mutual information between the context states and the states of interest can be an effective ingredient for overcoming challenges in robotic manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. A video showing experimental results is available at https://youtu.be/cLRrkd3Y7vU
10	Federated learning has a variety of applications in multiple domains by utilizing private training data stored on different devices. However, the aggregation process in federated learning is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks so that the global model may behave abnormally under attacks. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel aggregation algorithm with residual-based reweighting to defend federated learning. Our aggregation algorithm combines repeated median regression with the reweighting scheme in iteratively reweighted least squares. Our experiments show that our aggression algorithm outperforms other alternative algorithms in the presence of label-flipping, backdoor, and Gaussian noise attacks. We also provide theoretical guarantees for our aggregation algorithm.
01	Reinforcement learning encounters major challenges in multi-agent settings, such as scalability and non-stationarity. Recently, value function factorization learning emerges as a promising way to address these challenges in collaborative multi-agent systems. However, existing methods have been focusing on learning fully decentralized value functions, which are not efficient for tasks requiring communication. To address this limitation, this paper presents a novel framework for learning nearly decomposable Q-functions (NDQ) via communication minimization, with which agents act on their own most of the time but occasionally send messages to other agents in order for effective coordination. This framework hybridizes value function factorization learning and communication learning by introducing two information-theoretic regularizers. These regularizers are maximizing mutual information between agents' action selection and communication messages while minimizing the entropy of messages between agents. We show how to optimize these regularizers in a way that is easily integrated with existing value function factorization methods such as QMIX. Finally, we demonstrate that, on the StarCraft unit micromanagement benchmark, our framework significantly outperforms baseline methods and allows us to cut off more than $80\%$ of communication without sacrificing the performance. The videos of our experiments are available at https://sites.google.com/view/ndq.
10	Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) assigns labels to initially unlabelled vertices in a graph.Graph neural networks (GNNs), esp. graph convolutional networks (GCNs), inspired the current-state-of-the art models for graph-based SSL problems.GCNs inherently assume that the labels of interest are numerical or categorical variables.However, in many real-world applications such as co-authorship networks, recommendation networks, etc., vertex labels can be naturally represented by probability distributions or histograms.Moreover, real-world network datasets have complex relationships going beyond pairwise associations.These relationships can be modelled naturally and flexibly by hypergraphs.In this paper, we explore GNNs for graph-based SSL of histograms.Motivated by complex relationships (those going beyond pairwise) in real-world networks, we propose a novel method for directed hypergraphs.Our work builds upon existing works on graph-based SSL of histograms derived from the theory of optimal transportation.A key contribution of this paper is to establish generalisation error bounds for a one-layer GNN within the framework of algorithmic stability.We also demonstrate our proposed methods' effectiveness through detailed experimentation on real-world data.We have made the code available.
10	Domain adaptation focuses on the reuse of supervised learning models in a new context. Prominent applications can be found in robotics, image processing or web mining. In these areas, learning scenarios change by nature, but often remain related and motivate the reuse of existing supervised models.While the majority of symmetric and asymmetric domain adaptation algorithms utilize all available source and target domain data, we show that efficient domain adaptation requires only a substantially smaller subset from both domains. This makes it more suitable for real-world scenarios where target domain data is rare. The presented approach finds a target subspace representation for source and target data to address domain differences by orthogonal basis transfer. By employing a low-rank approximation, the approach remains low in computational time. The presented idea is evaluated in typical domain adaptation tasks with standard benchmark data.
10	Our goal is to infer reward functions from demonstrations. In order to infer the correct reward function, we must account for the systematic ways in which the demonstrator is suboptimal. Prior work in inverse reinforcement learning can account for specific, known biases, but cannot handle demonstrators with unknown biases. In this work, we explore the idea of learning the demonstrator's planning algorithm (including their unknown biases), along with their reward function. What makes this challenging is that any demonstration could be explained either by positing a term in the reward function, or by positing a particular systematic bias. We explore what assumptions are sufficient for avoiding this impossibility result: either access to tasks with known rewards which enable estimating the planner separately, or that the demonstrator is sufficiently close to optimal that this can serve as a regularizer. In our exploration with synthetic models of human biases, we find that it is possible to adapt to different biases and perform better than assuming a fixed model of the demonstrator, such as Boltzmann rationality.
10	Predicting the outcome of pharmacological assays based on high-resolution microscopyimages of treated cells is a crucial task in drug discovery which tremendouslyincreases discovery rates. However, end-to-end learning on these imageswith convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has not been ventured for this taskbecause it has been considered infeasible and overly complex. On the largestavailable public dataset, we compare several state-of-the-art CNNs trained in anend-to-end fashion with models based on a cell-centric approach involving segmentation.We found that CNNs operating on full images containing hundredsof cells perform significantly better at assay prediction than networks operatingon a single-cell level. Surprisingly, we could predict 29% of the 209 pharmacologicalassays at high predictive performance (AUC > 0.9). We compared anovel CNN architecture called “GapNet” against four competing CNN architecturesand found that it performs on par with the best methods and at the same timehas the lowest training time. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end learning onhigh-resolution imaging data is not only possible but even outperforms cell-centricand segmentation-dependent approaches. Hence, the costly cell segmentation andfeature extraction steps are not necessary, in fact they even hamper predictive performance.Our work further suggests that many pharmacological assays couldbe replaced by high-resolution microscopy imaging together with convolutionalneural networks.
01	This paper introduces the Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning, or bsuite for short. bsuite is a collection of carefully-designed experiments that investigate core capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL) agents with two objectives. First, to collect clear, informative and scalable problems that capture key issues in the design of general and efficient learning algorithms. Second, to study agent behaviour through their performance on these shared benchmarks. To complement this effort, we open source this http URL, which automates evaluation and analysis of any agent on bsuite. This library facilitates reproducible and accessible research on the core issues in RL, and ultimately the design of superior learning algorithms. Our code is Python, and easy to use within existing projects. We include examples with OpenAI Baselines, Dopamine as well as new reference implementations. Going forward, we hope to incorporate more excellent experiments from the research community, and commit to a periodic review of bsuite from a committee of prominent researchers.
10	We prove, under two sufficient conditions, that idealised models can have no adversarial examples. We discuss which idealised models satisfy our conditions, and show that idealised Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) satisfy these. We continue by studying near-idealised BNNs using HMC inference, demonstrating the theoretical ideas in practice. We experiment with HMC on synthetic data derived from MNIST for which we know the ground-truth image density, showing that near-perfect epistemic uncertainty correlates to density under image manifold, and that adversarial images lie off the manifold in our setting. This suggests why MC dropout, which can be seen as performing approximate inference, has been observed to be an effective defence against adversarial examples in practice; We highlight failure-cases of non-idealised BNNs relying on dropout, suggesting a new attack for dropout models and a new defence as well. Lastly, we demonstrate the defence on a cats-vs-dogs image classification task with a VGG13 variant.
10	"We develop new approximation and statistical learning theories of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) via the ResNet-type structure where the channel size, filter size, and width are fixed. It is shown that a ResNet-type CNN is a universal approximator and its expression ability is no worse than fully-connected neural networks (FNNs) with a \textit{block-sparse} structure even if the size of each layer in the CNN is fixed. Our result is general in the sense that we can automatically translate any approximation rate achieved by block-sparse FNNs into that by CNNs. Thanks to the general theory, it is shown that learning on CNNs satisfies optimality in approximation and estimation of several important function classes.As applications, we consider two types of function classes to be estimated: the Barron class and H\""older class. We prove the clipped empirical risk minimization (ERM) estimator can achieve the same rate as FNNs even the channel size, filter size, and width of CNNs are constant with respect to the sample size. This is minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for the H\""older class. Our proof is based on sophisticated evaluations of the covering number of CNNs and the non-trivial parameter rescaling technique to control the Lipschitz constant of CNNs to be constructed."
10	Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods using randomly selected batches are widely-used to train neural network (NN) models. Performing design exploration to find the best NN for a particular task often requires extensive training with different models on a large dataset,  which is very computationally expensive. The most straightforward method to accelerate this computation is to distribute the batch of SGD over multiple processors. However, large batch training often times leads to degradation in accuracy, poor generalization, and even poor robustness to adversarial attacks.  Existing solutions for large batch training either do not work or require massive hyper-parameter tuning. To address this issue, we propose a novel large batch training method which combines recent results in adversarial training (to regularize against ``sharp minima'') and second order optimization (to use curvature information to change batch size adaptively during training). We extensively evaluate our method on Cifar-10/100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet datasets, using multiple NNs, including residual networks as well as compressed networks such as SqueezeNext.  Our new approach exceeds the performance of the existing solutions in terms of both accuracy and the number of SGD iterations (up to 1\% and $3\times$, respectively). We emphasize that this is achieved without any additional hyper-parameter tuning to tailor our method to any of these experiments.
01	"We introduce ""Search with Amortized Value Estimates"" (SAVE), an approach for combining model-free Q-learning with model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In SAVE, a learned prior over state-action values is used to guide MCTS, which estimates an improved set of state-action values. The new Q-estimates are then used in combination with real experience to update the prior. This effectively amortizes the value computation performed by MCTS, resulting in a cooperative relationship between model-free learning and model-based search. SAVE can be implemented on top of any Q-learning agent with access to a model, which we demonstrate by incorporating it into agents that perform challenging physical reasoning tasks and Atari. SAVE consistently achieves higher rewards with fewer training steps, and---in contrast to typical model-based search approaches---yields strong performance with very small search budgets. By combining real experience with information computed during search, SAVE demonstrates that it is possible to improve on both the performance of model-free learning and the computational cost of planning."
10	An important question in task transfer learning is to determine task transferability, i.e. given a common input domain, estimating to what extent representations learned from a source task can help in learning a target task. Typically, transferability is either measured experimentally or inferred through task relatedness, which is often defined without a clear operational meaning. In this paper, we present a novel metric, H-score, an easily-computable evaluation function that estimates the performance of transferred representations from one task to another in classification problems. Inspired by a principled information theoretic approach, H-score has a direct connection to the asymptotic error probability of the decision function based on the transferred feature. This formulation of transferability can further be used to select a suitable set of source tasks in task transfer learning problems or to devise efficient transfer learning policies. Experiments using both synthetic and real image data show that not only our formulation of transferability is meaningful in practice, but also it can generalize to inference problems beyond classification, such as recognition tasks for 3D indoor-scene understanding.
10	Continual learning in neural networks (NN) often suffers from catastrophic forgetting. That is, when learning a sequence of tasks on an NN, the learning of a new task will cause weight changes that may destroy the learned knowledge embedded in the weights for previous tasks. Without solving this problem, it is difficult to use an NN to perform continual or lifelong learning. Although researchers have attempted to solve the problem in many ways, it remains to be challenging. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called principal components projection (PCP). The idea is that in learning a new task, if we can ensure that the gradient updates will only occur in the orthogonal directions to the input vectors of the previous tasks, then the weight updates for learning the new task will not affect the previous tasks. We propose to compute the principal components of the input vectors and use them to transform the input and to project the gradient updates for learning each new task. PCP does not need to store any sampled data from previous tasks or to generate pseudo data of previous tasks and use them to help learn a new task. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed method PCP markedly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods.
10	Deep ensembles have been empirically shown to be a promising approach for improving accuracy, uncertainty  and out-of-distribution robustness of deep learning models. While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable approximate Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight space. We demonstrate that while low-loss connectors between modes exist, they are not connected in the space of predictions. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular subspace sampling methods.
10	In medicine, both ethical and monetary costs of incorrect predictions can be significant, and the complexity of the problems often necessitates increasingly complex models. Recent work has shown that changing just the random seed is enough for otherwise well-tuned deep neural networks to vary in their individual predicted probabilities. In light of this, we investigate the role of model uncertainty methods in the medical domain. Using RNN ensembles and various Bayesian RNNs, we show that population-level metrics, such as AUC-PR, AUC-ROC, log-likelihood, and calibration error, do not capture model uncertainty. Meanwhile, the presence of significant variability in patient-specific predictions and optimal decisions motivates the need for capturing model uncertainty. Understanding the uncertainty for individual patients is an area with clear clinical impact, such as determining when a model decision is likely to be brittle. We further show that RNNs with only Bayesian embeddings can be a more efficient way to capture model uncertainty compared to ensembles, and we analyze how model uncertainty is impacted across individual input features and patient subgroups.
10	As deep learning applications are becoming more and more pervasive, the question of evaluating the reliability of a prediction becomes a central question in the machine learning community. This domain, known as predictive uncertainty, has come under the scrutiny of research groups developing Bayesian approaches to deep learning such as Monte Carlo Dropout. Unfortunately, for the time being, the real goal of predictive uncertainty has been swept under the rug. Indeed, Bayesian approaches are solely evaluated in terms of raw performance of the prediction, while the quality of the estimated uncertainty is not assessed. One contribution of this article is to draw attention on existing metrics developed in the forecast community, designed to evaluate both the sharpness and the calibration of predictive uncertainty. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and calibration to the consistency between the predicted uncertainty level and the actual errors. We further analyze the behavior of these metrics on regression problems when deep convolutional networks are involved and for several current predictive uncertainty approaches. A second contribution of this article is to propose an alternative metric that is more adapted to the evaluation of relative uncertainty assessment and directly applicable to regression with deep learning. This metric is evaluated and compared with existing ones on a toy dataset as well as on the problem of monocular depth estimation. 
10	Dropout has been one of standard approaches to train deep neural networks, and it is known to regularize large models to avoid overfitting. The effect of dropout has been explained by avoiding co-adaptation.In this paper, however, we propose a new explanation of why dropout works and propose a new technique to design better activation functions. First, we show that dropout can be explained as an optimization technique to push the input towards the saturation area of nonlinear activation function by accelerating gradient information flowing even in the saturation area in backpropagation. Based on this explanation, we propose a new technique for activation functions, {\em gradient acceleration in activation function (GAAF)}, that accelerates gradients to flow even in the saturation area. Then, input to the activation function can climb onto the saturation area which makes the network more robust because the model converges on a flat region.  Experiment results support our explanation of dropout and confirm that the proposed GAAF technique improves performances with expected properties.
10	We investigate global adversarial robustness guarantees for machine learning models.  Specifically, given a trained model we consider the problem of computing the probability that its prediction at any point sampled from the (unknown) input distribution is susceptible to adversarial attacks.  Assuming continuity of the model, we prove measurability for a selection of local robustness properties used in the literature. We then show how concentration inequalities can be employed to compute global robustness with estimation error upper-bounded by $\epsilon$, for any $\epsilon > 0$ selected a priori. We utilise the methods to provide statistically sound analysis of the robustness/accuracy trade-off for a variety of neural networks architectures and training methods on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR. We empirically observe that robustness and accuracy tend to be negatively correlated for networks trained via stochastic gradient descent and with iterative pruning techniques, while a positive trend is observed between them in Bayesian settings.
10	Real-time speech recognition on mobile and embedded devices is an important application of neural networks. Acoustic modeling is the fundamental part of speech recognition and is usually implemented with long short-term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, the single thread execution of an LSTM RNN is extremely slow in most embedded devices because the algorithm needs to fetch a large number of parameters from the DRAM for computing each output sample. We explore a few acoustic modeling algorithms that can be executed very efficiently on embedded devices. These algorithms reduce the overhead of memory accesses using multi-timestep parallelization that computes multiple output samples at a time by reading the parameters only once from the DRAM. The algorithms considered are the quasi RNNs (QRNNs), Gated ConvNets, and diagonalized LSTMs. In addition, we explore neural networks that equip one-dimensional (1-D) convolution at each layer of these algorithms, and by which can obtain a very large performance increase in the QRNNs and Gated ConvNets. The experiments were conducted using two tasks, one is the connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based end-to-end speech recognition on WSJ corpus and the other is the phoneme classification on TIMIT dataset. We not only significantly increase the execution speed but also obtain a much higher accuracy, compared to LSTM RNN-based modeling. Thus, this work can be applicable not only to embedded system-based implementations but also to server-based ones.
01	Layout is important for graphic design and scene generation. We propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network, called LayoutGAN, that synthesizes layouts by modeling geometric relations of different types of 2D elements. The generator of LayoutGAN takes as input a set of randomly-placed 2D graphic elements and uses self-attention modules to refine their labels and geometric parameters jointly to produce a realistic layout. Accurate alignment is critical for good layouts. We thus propose a novel differentiable wireframe rendering layer that maps the generated layout to a wireframe image, upon which a CNN-based discriminator is used to optimize the layouts in image space. We validate the effectiveness of LayoutGAN in various experiments including MNIST digit generation, document layout generation, clipart abstract scene generation and tangram graphic design.
01	We present a new approach to assessing the robustness of neural networks based on estimating the proportion of inputs for which a property is violated. Specifically, we estimate the probability of the event that the property is violated under an input model. Our approach critically varies from the formal verification framework in that when the property can be violated, it provides an informative notion of how robust the network is, rather than just the conventional assertion that the network is not verifiable. Furthermore, it provides an ability to scale to larger networks than formal verification approaches. Though the framework still provides a formal guarantee of satisfiability whenever it successfully finds one or more violations, these advantages do come at the cost of only providing a statistical estimate of unsatisfiability whenever no violation is found. Key to the practical success of our approach is an adaptation of multi-level splitting, a Monte Carlo approach for estimating the probability of rare events, to our statistical robustness framework. We demonstrate that our approach is able to emulate formal verification procedures on benchmark problems, while scaling to larger networks and providing reliable additional information in the form of accurate estimates of the violation probability.
10	Decentralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD), where parallel workers are connected to form a graph and communicate adjacently, has shown promising results both theoretically and empirically. In this paper we propose Moniqua, a technique that allows decentralized SGD to use quantized communication. We prove in theory that Moniqua communicates a provably bounded number of bits per iteration, while converging at the same asymptotic rate as the original algorithm does with full-precision communication. Moniqua improves upon prior works in that it (1) requires no additional memory, (2) applies to non-convex objectives, and (3) supports biased/linear quantizers. We demonstrate empirically that Moniqua converges faster with respect to wall clock time than other quantized decentralized algorithms.  We also show that Moniqua is robust to very low bit-budgets, allowing  less than 4-bits-per-parameter communication without affecting convergence when training VGG16 on CIFAR10.
10	Building robust online content recommendation systems requires learning com- plex interactions between user preferences and content features. The field has evolved rapidly in recent years from traditional multi-arm bandit and collabora- tive filtering techniques, with new methods integrating Deep Learning models that enable to capture non-linear feature interactions. Despite progress, the dynamic nature of online recommendations still poses great challenges, such as finding the delicate balance between exploration and exploitation. In this paper we provide a novel method, Deep Density Networks (DDN) which deconvolves measurement and data uncertainty and predicts probability densities of CTR, enabling us to perform more efficient exploration of the feature space. We show the usefulness of using DDN online in a real world content recommendation system that serves billions of recommendations per day, and present online and offline results to eval- uate the benefit of using DDN.
01	Rules over a knowledge graph (KG) capture interpretable patterns in data and can be used for KG cleaning and completion. Inspired by the TensorLog differentiable logic framework, which compiles rule inference into a sequence of differentiable operations, recently a method called Neural LP has been proposed for learning the parameters as well as the structure of rules. However, it is limited with respect to the treatment of numerical features like age, weight or scientific measurements. We address this limitation by extending Neural LP to learn rules with numerical values, e.g., ”People younger than 18 typically live with their parents“. We demonstrate how dynamic programming and cumulative sum operations can be exploited to ensure efficiency of such extension. Our novel approach allows us to extract more expressive rules with aggregates, which are of higher quality and yield more accurate predictions compared to rules learned by the state-of-the-art methods, as shown by our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
10	This paper studies aligning knowledge graphs from different sources or languages. Most existing methods train supervised methods for the alignment, which usually require a large number of aligned knowledge triplets. However, such a large number of aligned knowledge triplets may not be available or are expensive to obtain in many domains. Therefore, in this paper we propose to study aligning knowledge graphs in fully-unsupervised or weakly-supervised fashion, i.e., without or with only a few aligned triplets. We propose an unsupervised framework to align the entity and relation embddings of different knowledge graphs with an adversarial learning framework. Moreover, a regularization term which maximizes the mutual information between the embeddings of different knowledge graphs is used to mitigate the problem of mode collapse when learning the alignment functions. Such a framework can be further seamlessly integrated with existing supervised methods by utilizing a limited number of aligned triples as guidance. Experimental results on multiple datasets prove the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both the unsupervised and the weakly-supervised settings.
10	In this paper we show strategies to easily identify fake samples generated with the Generative Adversarial Network framework. One strategy is based on the statistical analysis and comparison of raw pixel values and features extracted from them. The other strategy learns formal specifications from the real data and shows that fake samples violate the specifications of the real data. We show that fake samples produced with GANs have a universal signature that can be used to identify fake samples. We provide results on MNIST, CIFAR10, music and speech data.
01	Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown excellent performance in processing sequence data. However, they are both complex and memory intensive due to their recursive nature. These limitations make RNNs difficult to embed on mobile devices requiring real-time processes with limited hardware resources. To address the above issues, we introduce a method that can learn binary and ternary weights during the training phase to facilitate hardware implementations of RNNs. As a result, using this approach replaces all multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, bringing significant benefits to custom hardware in terms of silicon area and power consumption. On the software side, we evaluate the performance (in terms of accuracy) of our method using long short-term memories (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) on various sequential models including sequence classification and language modeling. We demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results on the aforementioned tasks while using binary/ternary weights during the runtime. On the hardware side, we present custom hardware for accelerating the recurrent computations of LSTMs with binary/ternary weights. Ultimately, we show that LSTMs with binary/ternary weights can achieve up to 12x memory saving and 10x inference speedup compared to the full-precision hardware implementation design.
10	Deep neural networks (DNNs) typically have enough capacity to fit random data by brute force even when conventional data-dependent regularizations focusing on the geometry of the features are imposed. We find out that the reason for this is the inconsistency between the enforced geometry and the standard softmax cross entropy loss. To resolve this, we propose a new framework for data-dependent DNN regularization, the Geometrically-Regularized-Self-Validating neural Networks (GRSVNet). During training, the geometry enforced on one batch of features is simultaneously validated on a separate batch using a validation loss consistent with the geometry. We study  a particular case of GRSVNet, the Orthogonal-Low-rank Embedding (OLE)-GRSVNet, which is capable of producing highly discriminative features residing in orthogonal low-rank subspaces. Numerical experiments show that OLE-GRSVNet outperforms DNNs with conventional regularization when trained on real data. More importantly, unlike conventional DNNs, OLE-GRSVNet refuses to memorize random data or random labels, suggesting it only learns intrinsic patterns by reducing the memorizing capacity of the baseline DNN.
10	We study learning control in an online lifelong learning scenario, where mistakes can compound catastrophically into the future and the underlying dynamics of the environment may change. Traditional model-free policy learning methods have achieved successes in difficult tasks due to their broad flexibility, and capably condense broad experiences into compact networks, but struggle in this setting, as they can activate failure modes early in their lifetimes which are difficult to recover from and face performance degradation as dynamics change. On the other hand, model-based planning methods learn and adapt quickly, but require prohibitive levels of computational resources. Under constrained computation limits, the agent must allocate its resources wisely, which requires the agent to understand both its own performance and the current state of the environment: knowing that its mastery over control in the current dynamics is poor, the agent should dedicate more time to planning. We present a new algorithm, Adaptive Online Planning (AOP), that achieves strong performance in this setting by combining model-based planning with model-free learning. By measuring the performance of the planner and the uncertainty of the model-free components, AOP is able to call upon more extensive planning only when necessary, leading to reduced computation times. We show that AOP gracefully deals with novel situations, adapting behaviors and policies effectively in the face of unpredictable changes in the world -- challenges that a continual learning agent naturally faces over an extended lifetime -- even when traditional reinforcement learning methods fail.
01	We present Spectral Inference Networks, a framework for learning eigenfunctions of linear operators by stochastic optimization. Spectral Inference Networks generalize Slow Feature Analysis to generic symmetric operators, and are closely related to Variational Monte Carlo methods from computational physics. As such, they can be a powerful tool for unsupervised representation learning from video or graph-structured data. We cast training Spectral Inference Networks as a bilevel optimization problem, which allows for online learning of multiple eigenfunctions. We show results of training Spectral Inference Networks on problems in quantum mechanics and feature learning for videos on synthetic datasets. Our results demonstrate that Spectral Inference Networks accurately recover eigenfunctions of linear operators and can discover interpretable representations from video in a fully unsupervised manner.
01	Spectral clustering is a leading and popular technique in unsupervised data analysis.  Two of its major limitations are scalability and generalization of the spectral embedding (i.e., out-of-sample-extension). In this paper we introduce a deep learning approach to spectral clustering that overcomes the above shortcomings. Our network, which we call SpectralNet, learns a map that embeds input data points into the eigenspace of their associated graph Laplacian matrix and subsequently clusters them. We train SpectralNet using a procedure that involves constrained stochastic optimization. Stochastic optimization allows it to scale to large datasets, while the constraints, which are implemented using a special purpose output layer, allow us to keep the network output orthogonal. Moreover, the map learned by SpectralNet naturally generalizes the spectral embedding to unseen data points. To further improve the quality of the clustering, we replace the standard pairwise Gaussian affinities with affinities leaned from unlabeled data using a Siamese network.  Additional improvement can be achieved by applying the network to code representations produced, e.g., by standard autoencoders. Our end-to-end learning procedure is fully unsupervised. In addition, we apply VC dimension theory to derive a lower bound on the size of  SpectralNet.  State-of-the-art clustering results are reported for both the MNIST and Reuters datasets.
10	Effectively capturing graph node sequences in the form of vector embeddings is critical to many applications. We achieve this by (i) first learning vector embeddings of single graph nodes and (ii) then composing them to compactly represent node sequences. Specifically, we propose SENSE-S (Semantically Enhanced Node Sequence Embedding - for Single nodes), a skip-gram based novel embedding mechanism, for single graph nodes that co-learns graph structure as well as their textual descriptions. We demonstrate that SENSE-S vectors increase the accuracy of multi-label classification tasks by up to 50% and link-prediction tasks by up to 78% under a variety of scenarios using real datasets. Based on SENSE-S, we next propose generic SENSE to compute composite vectors that represent a sequence of nodes, where preserving the node order is important. We prove that this approach is efficient in embedding node sequences, and our experiments on real data confirm its high accuracy in node order decoding.
10	Learning in the presence of label noise is a challenging yet important task. It is crucial to design models that are robust to noisy labels. In this paper, we discover that a new class of loss functions called the gambler's loss provides strong robustness to label noise across various levels of corruption. Training with this modified loss function reduces memorization of data points with noisy labels and is a simple yet effective method to improve robustness and generalization. Moreover, using this loss function allows us to derive an analytical early stopping criterion that accurately estimates when memorization of noisy labels begins to occur. Our overall approach achieves strong results and outperforming existing baselines.
10	Building on the success of deep learning, two modern approaches to learn a probability model of the observed data are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs). VAEs consider an explicit probability model for the data and compute a generative distribution by maximizing a variational lower-bound on the log-likelihood function. GANs, however, compute a generative model by minimizing a distance between observed and generated probability distributions without considering an explicit model for the observed data. The lack of having explicit probability models in GANs prohibits computation of sample likelihoods in their frameworks and limits their use in statistical inference problems. In this work, we show that an optimal transport GAN with the entropy regularization can be viewed as a generative model that maximizes a lower-bound on average sample likelihoods, an approach that VAEs are based on. In particular, our proof constructs an explicit probability model for GANs that can be used to compute likelihood statistics within GAN's framework. Our numerical results on several datasets demonstrate consistent trends with the proposed theory. 
10	Coreference resolution is an important task for gaining more complete understanding about texts by artificial intelligence. The state-of-the-art end-to-end neural coreference model considers all spans in a document as potential mentions and learns to link an antecedent with each possible mention. However, for the verbatim same mentions, the model tends to get similar or even identical representations based on the features, and this leads to wrongful predictions. In this paper, we propose to improve the end-to-end system by building an attention model to reweigh features around different contexts. The proposed model substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art on the English dataset of the CoNLL 2012 Shared Task with 73.45% F1 score on development data and 72.84% F1 score on test data.
10	Generating visualizations and interpretations from high-dimensional data is acommon problem in many fields. Two key approaches for tackling this problem are clustering and representation learning. There are very performant deepclustering models on the one hand and interpretable representation learning techniques, often relying on latent topological structures such as self-organizing maps,on the other hand. However, current methods do not yet successfully combinethese two approaches. We present a new deep architecture for probabilistic clustering, VarPSOM, and its extension to time series data, VarTPSOM, composed of VarPSOM modules connected by LSTM cells. We show that they achieve superior clustering performance compared to current deep clustering methods on static MNIST/Fashion-MNIST data as well as medical time series, while inducing aninterpretable representation. Moreover, on the medical time series, VarTPSOMsuccessfully predicts future trajectories in the original data space.
01	A weakly supervised learning based clustering framework is proposed in this paper. As the core of this framework, we introduce a novel multiple instance learning task based on a bag level label called unique class count (ucc), which is the number of unique classes among all instances inside the bag. In this task, no annotations on individual instances inside the bag are needed during training of the models. We mathematically prove that with a perfect ucc classifier, perfect clustering of individual instances inside the bags is possible even when no annotations on individual instances are given during training. We have constructed a neural network based ucc classifier and experimentally shown that the clustering performance of our framework with our weakly supervised ucc classifier is comparable to that of fully supervised learning models where labels for all instances are known. Furthermore, we have tested the applicability of our framework to a real world task of semantic segmentation of breast cancer metastases in histological lymph node sections and shown that the performance of our weakly supervised framework is comparable to the performance of a fully supervised Unet model.
10	In the field of Continual Learning, the objective is to learn several tasks one after the other without access to the data from previous tasks. Several solutions have been proposed to tackle this problem but they usually  assume that the user knows which of the tasks to perform at test time on a particular sample, or rely on small samples from previous data and most of them suffer of a substantial drop in accuracy when updated with batches of only one class at a time. In this article, we propose a new method, OvA-INN, which is able to learn one class at a time and without storing any of the previous data. To achieve this, for each class, we train a specific Invertible Neural Network to output the zero vector for its class. At test time, we can predict the class of a sample by identifying which network outputs the vector with the smallest norm. With this method, we show that we can take advantage of pretrained models by stacking an invertible network on top of a features extractor. This way, we are able to outperform state-of-the-art approaches that rely on features learning for the Continual Learning of MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets. In our experiments, we are reaching 72% accuracy on CIFAR-100 after training our model one class at a time.
10	A fundamental challenge in designing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is decoding behavior from time-varying neural oscillations. In typical applications, decoders are constructed for individual subjects and with limited data leading to restrictions on the types of models that can be utilized. Currently, the best performing decoders are typically linear models capable of utilizing rigid timing constraints with limited training data. Here we demonstrate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to take advantage of the temporal information present in sequential neural data collected from subjects implanted with electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrode arrays performing a finger flexion task. Our constructed models are capable of achieving accuracies that are comparable to existing techniques while also being robust to variation in sample data size. Moreover, we utilize the LSTM networks and an affine transformation layer to construct a novel architecture for transfer learning. We demonstrate that in scenarios where only the affine transform is learned for a new subject, it is possible to achieve results comparable to existing state-of-the-art techniques. The notable advantage is the increased stability of the model during training on novel subjects. Relaxing the constraint of only training the affine transformation, we establish our model as capable of exceeding performance of current models across all training data sizes. Overall, this work demonstrates that LSTMs are a versatile model that can accurately capture temporal patterns in neural data and can provide a foundation for transfer learning in neural decoding.
10	Source separation for music is the task of isolating contributions, or stems, from different instruments recorded individually and arranged together to form a song.Such components include voice, bass, drums and any other accompaniments. While end-to-end models that directly generate the waveform are state-of-the-art in many audio synthesis problems, the best multi-instrument source separation models generate masks on the magnitude spectrum and achieve performances far above current end-to-end, waveform-to-waveform models. We present an in-depth analysis of a new architecture, which we will refer to as Demucs, based on a (transposed) convolutional autoencoder, with a bidirectional LSTM at the bottleneck layer and skip-connections as in U-Networks (Ronneberger et al., 2015). Compared to the state-of-the-art waveform-to-waveform model, Wave-U-Net (Stoller et al., 2018), the main features of our approach in addition of the bi-LSTM are the use of trans-posed convolution layers instead of upsampling-convolution blocks, the use of gated linear units, exponentially growing the number of channels with depth and a new careful initialization of the weights.  Results on the MusDB dataset show that our architecture achieves a signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) nearly 2.2 points higher than the best waveform-to-waveform competitor (from 3.2 to 5.4 SDR). This makes our model match the state-of-the-art performances on this dataset, bridging the performance gap between models that operate on the spectrogram and end-to-end approaches.
10	In Chinese societies, superstition is of paramount importance, and vehicle license plates with desirable numbers can fetch very high prices in auctions. Unlike other valuable items, license plates are not allocated an estimated price before auction. I propose that the task of predicting plate prices can be viewed as a natural language processing (NLP) task, as the value depends on the meaning of each individual character on the plate and its semantics. I construct a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the prices of vehicle license plates in Hong Kong, based on the characters on a plate. I demonstrate the importance of having a deep network and of retraining. Evaluated on 13 years of historical auction prices, the deep RNN's predictions can explain over 80 percent of price variations, outperforming previous models by a significant margin.  I also demonstrate how the model can be extended to become a search engine for plates and to provide estimates of the expected price distribution.
10	In this research, we present a novel learning scheme called network iterative learning for deep neural networks. Different from traditional optimization algorithms that usually optimize directly on a static objective function, we propose in this work to optimize a dynamic objective function in an iterative fashion capable of adapting its function form when being optimized. The optimization is implemented as a series of intermediate neural net functions that is able to dynamically grow into the targeted neural net objective function. This is done via network morphism so that the network knowledge is fully preserved with each network growth. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network iterative learning scheme is able to significantly alleviate the degradation problem. Its effectiveness is verified on diverse benchmark datasets.
01	Ensembles of models often yield improvements in system performance. These ensemble approaches have also been empirically shown to yield robust measures of uncertainty, and are capable of distinguishing between different forms of uncertainty. However, ensembles come at a computational and memory cost which may be prohibitive for many applications. There has been significant work done on the distillation of an ensemble into a single model. Such approaches decrease computational cost and allow a single model to achieve an accuracy comparable to that of an ensemble. However, information about the diversity of the ensemble, which can yield estimates of different forms of uncertainty, is lost. This work considers the novel task of Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EnD^2) - distilling the distribution of the predictions from an ensemble, rather than just the average prediction, into a single model. EnD^2 enables a single model to retain both the improved classification performance of ensemble distillation as well as information about the diversity of the ensemble, which is useful for uncertainty estimation. A solution for EnD^2 based on Prior Networks, a class of models which allow a single neural network to explicitly model a distribution over output distributions, is proposed in this work. The properties of EnD^2 are investigated on both an artificial dataset, and on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet datasets, where it is shown that EnD^2 can approach the classification performance of an ensemble, and outperforms both standard DNNs and Ensemble Distillation on the tasks of misclassification and out-of-distribution input detection.
10	Disentangling underlying generative factors of a data distribution is important for interpretability and generalizable representations. In this paper,  we introduce two novel disentangling methods. Our first method, Unlabeled Disentangling GAN (UD-GAN, unsupervised), decomposes the latent noise by generating similar/dissimilar image pairs and it learns a distance metric on these pairs with siamese networks and a contrastive loss. This pairwise approach provides consistent representations for similar data points. Our second method (UD-GAN-G, weakly supervised) modifies the UD-GAN with user-defined guidance functions, which restrict the information that goes into the siamese networks. This constraint helps UD-GAN-G to focus on the desired semantic variations in the data. We  show  that  both  our  methods  outperform  existing  unsupervised approaches in quantitative metrics that measure semantic accuracy of the learned representations. In addition, we illustrate that simple guidance functions we use in UD-GAN-G allow us to directly capture the desired variations in the data.
10	Off-policy temporal difference (TD) methods are a powerful class of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Intriguingly, deep off-policy TD algorithms are not commonly used in combination with feature normalization techniques, despite positive effects of normalization in other domains. We show that naive application of existing normalization techniques is indeed not effective, but that well-designed normalization improves optimization stability and removes the necessity of target networks. In particular, we introduce a normalization based on a mixture of on- and off-policy transitions, which we call cross-normalization. It can be regarded as an extension of batch normalization that re-centers data for two different distributions, as present in off-policy learning. Applied to DDPG and TD3, cross-normalization improves over the state of the art across a range of MuJoCo benchmark tasks.
10	Importance sampling is a common approach to off-policy learning in reinforcement learning.  While it is consistent and unbiased, it can result in high variance updates to the parameters for the value function. Weighted importance sampling (WIS) has been explored to reduce variance for off-policy policy evaluation, but only for linear value function approximation. In this work, we explore a resampling strategy to reduce variance, rather than a reweighting strategy. We propose Importance Resampling (IR) for off-policy learning, that resamples experience from the replay buffer and applies a standard on-policy update. The approach avoids using importance sampling ratios directly in the update, instead correcting the distribution over transitions before the update. We characterize the bias and consistency of the our estimator, particularly compared to WIS. We then demonstrate in several toy domains that IR has improved sample efficiency and parameter sensitivity, as compared to several baseline WIS estimators and to IS. We conclude with a demonstration showing IR improves over IS for learning a value function from images in a racing car simulator.
01	We propose precision gating (PG), an end-to-end trainable dynamic dual-precision quantization technique for deep neural networks.  PG computes most features in a low precision and only a small proportion of important features in a higher precision to preserve accuracy.  The proposed approach is applicable to a variety of DNN architectures and significantly reduces the computational cost of DNN execution with almost no accuracy loss.  Our experiments indicate that PG achieves excellent results on CNNs, including statically compressed mobile-friendly networks such as ShuffleNet. Compared to the state-of-the-art prediction-based quantization schemes, PG achieves the same or higher accuracy with 2.4× less compute on ImageNet. PG furthermore applies to RNNs. Compared to 8-bit uniform quantization, PG obtains a 1.2% improvement in perplexity per word with 2.7× computational cost reduction on LSTM on the Penn Tree Bank dataset.
10	This paper revisits the Random Walk model for sentence embedding in the context of non-extensive statistics. We propose a non-extensive algebra to compute the discourse vector. We argue that by doing so we are taking into account high non-linearity in the semantic space. Furthermore, we show that by considering a non-extensive algebra, the compounding effect of the vector length is mitigated. Overall, we show that the proposed model leads to good sentence embedding. We evaluate the embedding method on textual similarity tasks.
01	In many environments only a tiny subset of all states yield high reward.  In these cases, few of the interactions with the environment provide a relevant learning signal. Hence, we may want to preferentially train on those high-reward states and the probable trajectories leading to them. To this end, we advocate for the use of a \textit{backtracking model} that predicts the preceding states that terminate at a given high-reward state.  We can train a model which, starting from a high value state (or one that is estimated to have high value), predicts and samples which (state, action)-tuples may have led to that high value state. These traces of (state, action) pairs, which we refer to as Recall Traces, sampled from this backtracking model starting from a high value state, are informative as they terminate in good states, and hence we can use these traces to improve a policy. We provide a variational interpretation for this idea and a practical algorithm in which the backtracking model samples from an approximate posterior distribution over trajectories which lead to large rewards. Our method improves the sample efficiency of both on- and off-policy RL algorithms across several environments and tasks.  
10	Training good policies for large combinatorial action spaces is onerous and usually tackled with imitation learning, curriculum learning, or reward shaping. Each of these methods has requirements that can hinder their general application. Here, we study how growing the action space of the policy during training can structure the exploration and lead to convergence without any external data (imitation), with less control over the environment (curriculum), and with minimal reward shaping. We evaluate this approach on a challenging end-to-end full games army control task in StarCraft: Brood War by training policies through self-play from scratch. We grow the spatial resolution and frequency of actions and achieve superior results compared to operating purely at finer resolutions.
10	Semantic parsing which maps a natural language sentence into a formal machine-readable representation of its meaning, is highly constrained by the limited annotated training data. Inspired by the idea of coarse-to-fine, we propose a general-to-detailed neural network(GDNN) by incorporating cross-domain sketch(CDS) among utterances and their logic forms. For utterances in different domains, the General Network will extract CDS using an encoder-decoder model in a multi-task learning setup. Then for some utterances in a specific domain, the Detailed Network will generate the detailed target parts using sequence-to-sequence architecture with advanced attention to both utterance and generated CDS. Our experiments show that compared to direct multi-task learning, CDS has improved the performance in semantic parsing task which converts users' requests into meaning representation language(MRL). We also use experiments to illustrate that CDS works by adding some constraints to the target decoding process, which further proves the effectiveness and rationality of CDS.
01	Few-shot classification refers to learning a classifier for new classes given only a few examples. While a plethora of models have emerged to tackle it, we find the procedure and datasets that are used to assess their progress lacking. To address this limitation, we propose Meta-Dataset: a new benchmark for training and evaluating models that is large-scale, consists of diverse datasets, and presents more realistic tasks. We experiment with popular baselines and meta-learners on Meta-Dataset, along with a competitive method that we propose. We analyze performance as a function of various characteristics of test tasks and examine the models’ ability to leverage diverse training sources for improving their generalization. We also propose a new set of baselines for quantifying the benefit of meta-learning in Meta-Dataset. Our extensive experimentation has uncovered important research challenges and we hope to inspire work in these directions.
01	Most algorithms for representation learning and link prediction in relational data have been designed for static data. However, the data they are applied to usually evolves with time, such as friend graphs in social networks or user interactions with items in recommender systems. This is also the case for knowledge bases, which contain facts such as (US, has president, B. Obama, [2009-2017]) that are valid only at certain points in time. For the problem of link prediction under temporal constraints, i.e., answering queries of the form (US, has president, ?, 2012), we propose a solution inspired by the canonical decomposition of tensors of order 4.We introduce new regularization schemes and present an extension of ComplEx that achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we propose a new dataset for knowledge base completion constructed from Wikidata, larger than previous benchmarks by an order of magnitude, as a new reference for evaluating temporal and non-temporal link prediction methods. 
01	"Fine-tuning a deep network trained with the standard cross-entropy loss is a strong baseline for few-shot learning. When fine-tuned transductively, this outperforms the current state-of-the-art on standard datasets such as Mini-ImageNet, Tiered-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS and FC-100 with the same hyper-parameters. The simplicity of this approach enables us to demonstrate the first few-shot learning results on the ImageNet-21k dataset. We find that using a large number of meta-training classes results in high few-shot accuracies even for a large number of few-shot classes. We do not advocate our approach as the solution for few-shot learning, but simply use the results to highlight limitations of current benchmarks and few-shot protocols. We perform extensive studies on benchmark datasets to propose a metric that quantifies the ""hardness"" of a few-shot episode. This metric can be used to report the performance of few-shot algorithms in a more systematic way."
01	We investigate the properties of multidimensional probability distributions in the context of latent space prior distributions of implicit generative models. Our work revolves around the phenomena arising while decoding linear interpolations between two random latent vectors -- regions of latent space in close proximity to the origin of the space are oversampled, which restricts the usability of linear interpolations as a tool to analyse the latent space. We show that the distribution mismatch can be eliminated completely by a proper choice of the latent probability distribution or using non-linear interpolations. We prove that there is a trade off between the interpolation being linear, and the latent distribution having even the most basic properties required for stable training, such as finite mean. We use the multidimensional Cauchy distribution as an example of the prior distribution, and also provide a general method of creating non-linear interpolations, that is easily applicable to a large family of commonly used latent distributions.
10	  We introduce a model that learns to convert simple hand drawings  into graphics programs written in a subset of \LaTeX.~The model  combines techniques from deep learning and program synthesis.  We  learn a convolutional neural network that proposes plausible drawing  primitives that explain an image. These drawing primitives are like  a trace of the set of primitive commands issued by a graphics  program. We learn a model that uses program synthesis techniques to  recover a graphics program from that trace. These programs have  constructs like variable bindings, iterative loops, or simple kinds  of conditionals. With a graphics program in hand, we can correct  errors made by the deep network and extrapolate drawings.  Taken  together these results are a step towards agents that induce useful,  human-readable programs from perceptual input.
10	Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are trained to generate a sample image of interest. To this end, generative network of GAN learns implicit distribution of true dataset from the classification samples with candidate generated samples. However, in real implementation of GAN, training the generative network with limited number of candidate samples guarantees to properly represent neither true distribution nor the distribution of generator outputs. In this paper, we propose dual importance weights for the candidate samples represented in the latent space of auto-encoder. The auto-encoder is pre-trained with real target dataset. Therefore, the latent space representation allows us to compare real distribution and the distribution of generated samples explicitly. Dual importance weights iteratively maximize the representation of generated samples for both distributions: current generator outputs and real dataset. Proposed generative model not only resolves mode collapse problem of GAN but also improves the convergence on target distribution. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed network learns complete modes of target distribution more stable and faster than state of the art methods. 
10	There exist several stochastic optimization algorithms. However in most cases, it is difficult to tell for a particular problem which will be the best optimizer to choose as each of them are good. Thus, we present a simple and intuitive technique, when applied to first order optimization algorithms, is able to improve the speed of convergence and reaches a better minimum for the loss function compared to the original algorithms. The proposed solution modifies the update rule, based on the variation of the direction of the gradient during training. We conducted several tests with Adam and AMSGrad on two different  datasets. The preliminary results show that the proposed technique improves the performance of existing optimization algorithms and works well in practice.
10	Due to the significant costs of data generation, many prediction tasks within drug discovery are by nature few-shot regression (FSR) problems, including accurate modelling of biological assays.  Although a number of few-shot classification and reinforcement learning methods exist for similar applications, we find relatively few FSR methods meeting the performance standards required for such tasks under real-world constraints. Inspired by deep kernel learning, we develop a novel FSR algorithm that is better suited to these settings. Our algorithm consists of learning a deep network in combination with a kernel function and a differentiable kernel algorithm. As the choice of the kernel is critical, our algorithm learns to find the appropriate one for each task during inference. It thus performs more effectively with complex task distributions, outperforming current state-of-the-art algorithms on both toy and novel, real-world benchmarks that we introduce herein. By introducing novel benchmarks derived from biological assays, we hope that the community will progress towards the development of FSR algorithms suitable for use in noisy and uncertain environments such as drug discovery.
10	We explore self-supervision as a way to learn general purpose audiorepresentations. Specifically, we propose self-supervised tasks that exploit thetemporal context in the spectrogram domain. The temporal gap task estimatesthe distance between two short audio segments extracted at random from the sameaudio clip. The Audio2Vec task is inspired by Word2Vec, a populartechnique used to learn word embeddings, and aim at reconstructing a spectrogramslice from past and future slices or, alternatively, at reconstructing thecontext of surrounding slices from the current slice. We evaluate the quality ofthe embeddings produced by the self-supervised learning models, measuring theaccuracy of linear classifiers, which receive the embeddings as input and aim ataddressing a variety of downstream audio tasks. Our results show that thelearned representations partially bridge the performance gap with fullysupervised models of similar size, and for some tasks even approach theirperformance.
10	Learning causal relations from observational time series with nonlinear interactions and complex causal structures is a key component of human intelligence, and has a wide range of applications. Although neural nets have demonstrated their effectiveness in a variety of fields, their application in learning causal relations has been scarce. This is due to both a lack of theoretical results connecting risk minimization and causality (enabling function approximators like neural nets to apply), and a lack of scalability in prior causal measures to allow for expressive function approximators like neural nets to apply. In this work, we propose a novel causal measure and algorithm using risk minimization to infer causal relations from time series. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithms to learn nonlinear causal models in synthetic datasets as comparing to other methods, and its effectiveness in inferring causal relations in a video game environment and real-world heart-rate vs. breath-rate and rat brain EEG datasets.
10	This work provides an automatic machine learning (AutoML) modelling architecture called Autostacker. Autostacker improves the prediction accuracy of machine learning baselines by utilizing an innovative hierarchical stacking architecture and an efficient parameter search algorithm. Neither prior domain knowledge about the data nor feature preprocessing is needed. We significantly reduce the time of AutoML with a naturally inspired algorithm - Parallel Hill Climbing (PHC). By parallelizing PHC, Autostacker can provide candidate pipelines with sufficient prediction accuracy within a short amount of time. These pipelines can be used as is or as a starting point for human experts to build on. By focusing on the modelling process, Autostacker breaks the tradition of following fixed order pipelines by exploring not only single model pipeline but also innovative combinations and structures. As we will show in the experiment section, Autostacker achieves significantly better performance both in terms of test accuracy and time cost comparing with human initial trials and recent popular AutoML system.
10	We present a deep recurrent neural network architecture to solve a class of stochastic optimal control problems described by fully nonlinear Hamilton Jacobi Bellman partial differential equations. Such PDEs arise when one considers stochastic dynamics characterized by uncertainties that are additive and control multiplicative. Stochastic models with the aforementioned characteristics have been used in computational neuroscience, biology, finance and aerospace systems and provide a more accurate representation of actuation than models with additive uncertainty. Previous literature has established the inadequacy of the linear HJB theory and instead rely on a non-linear Feynman-Kac lemma resulting in a second order forward-backward stochastic differential equations representation. However, the proposed solutions that use this representation suffer from compounding errors and computational complexity leading to lack of scalability. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based algorithm that leverages the second order Forward-Backward SDE representation and LSTM based recurrent neural networks to not only solve such Stochastic Optimal Control problems but also overcome the problems faced by previous approaches and scales well to high dimensional systems. The resulting control algorithm is tested on non-linear systems in robotics and biomechanics to demonstrate feasibility and out-performance against previous methods.   
10	Neural networks show great vulnerability under the threat of adversarial examples.   By adding small perturbation to a clean image, neural networks with high classification accuracy can be completely fooled.   One intriguing property of the adversarial examples is transferability.  This property allows adversarial examples to transfer to networks of unknown structure, which is harmful even to the physical world.   The current way of generating adversarial examples is mainly divided into optimization based and gradient based methods.   Liu et al. (2017) conjecture that gradient based methods can hardly produce transferable targeted adversarial examples in black-box-attack.   However, in this paper, we use a simple technique to improve the transferability and success rate of targeted attacks with gradient based methods.   We prove that gradient based methods can also generate transferable adversarial examples in targeted attacks.   Specifically, we use knowledge distillation for gradient based methods, and show that the transferability can be improved by effectively utilizing different classes of information.   Unlike the usual applications of knowledge distillation, we did not train a student network to generate adversarial examples.   We take advantage of the fact that knowledge distillation can soften the target and obtain higher information, and combine the soft target and hard target of the same network as the loss function.   Our method is generally applicable to most gradient based attack methods.
10	Generative Adversarial Networks are powerful generative models that can model the manifold of natural images. We leverage this property to perform manifold regularization by approximating a variant of the Laplacian norm using a Monte Carlo approximation that is easily computed with the GAN. When incorporated into the semi-supervised feature-matching GAN we achieve state-of-the-art results for semi-supervised learning on CIFAR-10 benchmarks when few labels are used, with a method that is significantly easier to implement than competing methods. We find that manifold regularization improves the quality of generated images, and is affected by the quality of the GAN used to approximate the regularizer.
10	Temperature scaling has been widely used to improve performance for NLP tasks that utilize Softmax decision layer. Current practices in using temperature either assume a ﬁxed value or a dynamically changing temperature but with a ﬁxed schedule. Little has been known on an optimal trajectory of temperature that can change with the context. In this paper, we propose contextual temperature, a mechanism that allows temperatures to change over the context for each vocabulary, and to co-adopt with model parameters during training. Experimental results illustrated that contextual temperature improves over state-of-the-art language models signiﬁcantly. Our model CT-MoS achieved a perplexity of 55.31 in the test set of Penn Treebank and a perplexity of 62.89 in the test set of WikiText-2. The in-depth analysis showed that the behavior of temperature schedule varies dramatically by vocabulary. The optimal temperature trajectory drops as the context becomes longer to suppress uncertainties in language modeling. These evidence further justiﬁed the need for contextual temperature and explained its performance advantage over ﬁxed temperature or scheduling.
10	Robustness and security of machine learning (ML) systems are intertwined, wherein a non-robust ML system (classifiers, regressors, etc.) can be subject to attacks using a wide variety of exploits. With the advent of scalable deep learning methodologies, a lot of emphasis has been put on the robustness of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning algorithms. Here, we study the robustness of the latent space of a deep variational autoencoder (dVAE), an unsupervised generative framework, to show that it is indeed possible to perturb the latent space, flip the class predictions and keep the classification probability approximately equal before and after an attack. This means that an agent that looks at the outputs of a decoder would remain oblivious to an attack.
10	Existing neural architecture search (NAS) methods explore a limited feature-transformation-only search space while ignoring other advanced feature operations such as feature self-calibration by attention and dynamic convolutions. This disables the NAS algorithms to discover more advanced network architectures. We address this limitation by additionally exploiting feature self-calibration operations, resulting in a heterogeneous search space. To solve the challenges of operation heterogeneity and significantly larger search space, we formulate a neural operator search (NOS) method. NOS presents a novel heterogeneous residual block for integrating the heterogeneous operations in a unified structure, and an attention guided search strategy for facilitating the search process over a vast space. Extensive experiments show that NOS can search novel cell architectures with highly competitive performance on the CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks.
01	Deep networks run with low precision operations at inference time offer power and space advantages over high precision alternatives, but need to overcome the challenge of maintaining high accuracy as precision decreases. Here, we present a method for training such networks, Learned Step Size Quantization, that achieves the highest accuracy to date on the ImageNet dataset when using models, from a variety of architectures, with weights and activations quantized to 2-, 3- or 4-bits of precision, and that can train 3-bit models that reach full precision baseline accuracy. Our approach builds upon existing methods for learning weights in quantized networks by improving how the quantizer itself is configured. Specifically, we introduce a novel means to estimate and scale the task loss gradient at each weight and activation layer's quantizer step size, such that it can be learned in conjunction with other network parameters. This approach works using different levels of precision as needed for a given system and requires only a simple modification of existing training code.
10	We explore the idea of compositional set embeddings that can be used to infer notjust a single class, but the set of classes associated with the input data (e.g., image,video, audio signal). This can be useful, for example, in multi-object detection inimages, or multi-speaker diarization (one-shot learning) in audio. In particular, wedevise and implement two novel models consisting of (1) an embedding functionf trained jointly with a “composite” function g that computes set union opera-tions between the classes encoded in two embedding vectors; and (2) embeddingf trained jointly with a “query” function h that computes whether the classes en-coded in one embedding subsume the classes encoded in another embedding. Incontrast to prior work, these models must both perceive the classes associatedwith the input examples, and also encode the relationships between different classlabel sets. In experiments conducted on simulated data, OmniGlot, and COCOdatasets, the proposed composite embedding models outperform baselines basedon traditional embedding approaches.
10	 Deep neural networks are used in many state-of-the-art systems for machine perception. Once a network is trained to do a specific task, it cannot be easily trained to do new tasks as it leads to catastrophic forgetting of the previously learned tasks. We propose here a novel architecture called EnsembleNet that accommodates for newer classes of data without having to retrain previously trained sub-models. The novelty of our model lies in the fact that only a small portion of the network has to be retrained which makes it extremely computational efficient and also results in high performance compared to other architectures in the literature. We demonstrated our model on MNIST Handwritten digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR10 datasets. The proposed architecture was benchmarked against other models in the literature on Omega-new, Omega-base, Omega-all metrics for MNIST- Handwritten dataset. The experimental results show that Ensemble Net on overall outperformed every other model in the literature.
10	We introduce MultiGrain, a neural network architecture that generates compact image embedding vectors that solve multiple tasks of different granularity: class, instance, and copy recognition. MultiGrain is trained jointly for classification by optimizing the cross-entropy loss and for instance/copy recognition by optimizing a self-supervised ranking loss. The self-supervised loss only uses data augmentation and thus does not require additional labels. Remarkably, the unified embeddings are not only much more compact than using several specialized embeddings, but they also have the same or better accuracy. When fed to a linear classifier, MultiGrain using ResNet-50 achieves 79.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, a +1.8% absolute improvement over the the current state-of-the-art AutoAugment method. The same embeddings perform on par with state-of-the-art instance retrieval with images of moderate resolution. An ablation study shows that our approach benefits from the self-supervision, the pooling method and the mini-batches with repeated augmentations of the same image.
10	The attention mechanism is an indispensable component of any state-of-the-art neural machine translation system. However, existing attention methods are often token-based and ignore the importance of phrasal alignments, which are the backbone of phrase-based statistical machine translation. We propose a novel phrase-based attention method to model n-grams of tokens as the basic attention entities, and design multi-headed phrasal attentions within the Transformer architecture to perform token-to-token and token-to-phrase mappings. Our approach yields improvements in English-German, English-Russian and English-French translation tasks on the standard WMT'14 test set. Furthermore, our phrasal attention method shows improvements on the one-billion-word language modeling benchmark.
01	This paper presents a novel physics-inspired deep learning approach for point cloud processing motivated by the natural flow phenomena in fluid mechanics.  Our learning architecture jointly defines data in an Eulerian world space, using a static background grid, and a Lagrangian material space, using moving particles. By introducing this Eulerian-Lagrangian representation, we are able to naturally evolve and accumulate particle features using flow velocities generated from a generalized, high-dimensional force field.  We demonstrate the efficacy of this system by solving various point cloud classification and segmentation problems with state-of-the-art performance. The entire geometric reservoir and data flow mimic the pipeline of the classic PIC/FLIP scheme in modeling natural flow, bridging the disciplines of geometric machine learning and physical simulation.
10	We introduce a novel geometric perspective and unsupervised model augmentation framework for transforming traditional deep (convolutional) neural networks into adversarially robust classifiers. Class-conditional probability densities based on Bayesian nonparametric mixtures of factor analyzers (BNP-MFA) over the input space are used to design soft decision labels for feature to label isometry. Classconditional distributions over features are also learned using BNP-MFA to develop plug-in maximum a posterior (MAP) classifiers to replace the traditional multinomial logistic softmax classification layers. This novel unsupervised augmented framework, which we call geometrically robust networks (GRN), is applied to CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and to Radio-ML (a time series dataset for radio modulation recognition). We demonstrate the robustness of GRN models to adversarial attacks from fast gradient sign method, Carlini-Wagner, and projected gradient descent.
10	Neural reading comprehension models have recently achieved impressive gener- alisation results, yet still perform poorly when given adversarially selected input. Most prior work has studied semantically invariant text perturbations which cause a model’s prediction to change when it should not. In this work we focus on the complementary problem: excessive prediction undersensitivity where input text is meaningfully changed, and the model’s prediction does not change when it should. We formulate a noisy adversarial attack which searches among semantic variations of comprehension questions for which a model still erroneously pro- duces the same answer as the original question – and with an even higher prob- ability. We show that – despite comprising unanswerable questions – SQuAD2.0 and NewsQA models are vulnerable to this attack and commit a substantial frac- tion of errors on adversarially generated questions. This indicates that current models—even where they can correctly predict the answer—rely on spurious sur- face patterns and are not necessarily aware of all information provided in a given comprehension question. Developing this further, we experiment with both data augmentation and adversarial training as defence strategies: both are able to sub- stantially decrease a model’s vulnerability to undersensitivity attacks on held out evaluation data. Finally, we demonstrate that adversarially robust models gener- alise better in a biased data setting with a train/evaluation distribution mismatch; they are less prone to overly rely on predictive cues only present in the training set and outperform a conventional model in the biased data setting by up to 11% F1.
10	The information bottleneck principle (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017) suggests that SGD-based training of deep neural networks results in optimally compressed hidden layers, from an information theoretic perspective. However, this claim was established on toy data. The goal of the work we present here is to test these claims in a realistic setting using a larger and deeper convolutional architecture, a ResNet model. We trained PixelCNN++ models as inverse representation decoders to measure the mutual information between hidden layers of a ResNet and input image data, when trained for (1) classification and (2) autoencoding. We find that two stages of learning happen for both training regimes, and that compression does occur, even for an autoencoder. Sampling images by conditioning on hidden layers’ activations offers an intuitive visualisation to understand what a ResNets learns to forget.
10	Various architectural advancements in the design of recurrent neural networks~(RNN) have been focusing on improving the empirical stability and representability by sacrificing the complexity of the architecture. However, more remains to be done to fully understand the fundamental trade-off between these conflicting requirements. Towards answering this question, we forsake the purely bottom-up approach of data-driven machine learning to understand, instead,  the physical origin and dynamical properties of existing RNN architectures.  This facilitates designing new RNNs with smaller complexity overhead and provable stability guarantee. First, we define a family of  deep recurrent neural networks,  $n$-$t$-ORNN, according to the order of nonlinearity $n$ and the range of temporal memory scale $t$ in their underlying dynamics embodied in the form of discretized ordinary differential equations. We show that most of the existing proposals of RNN architectures belong to different orders of $n$-$t$-ORNNs.    We then propose a new RNN ansatz, namely the Quantum-inspired  Universal computing  Neural Network~(QUNN), to leverage the reversibility, stability, and universality of quantum computation for stable and universal RNN.  QUNN   provides a complexity reduction in the number of training parameters from being polynomial in both data and correlation time to only linear in correlation time.  Compared to Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM), QUNN of the same number of hidden layers facilitates higher nonlinearity and longer memory span with provable stability. Our work opens new directions in designing minimal RNNs based on additional knowledge about the dynamical nature of both the data and different training architectures.
01	Person re-identification (re-ID) aims at identifying the same persons' images across different cameras. However, domain diversities between different datasets pose an evident challenge for adapting the re-ID model trained on one dataset to another one. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods for person re-ID transferred the learned knowledge from the source domain by optimizing with pseudo labels created by clustering algorithms on the target domain. Although they achieved state-of-the-art performances, the inevitable label noise caused by the clustering procedure was ignored. Such noisy pseudo labels substantially hinders the model's capability on further improving feature representations on the target domain. In order to mitigate the effects of noisy pseudo labels, we propose to softly refine the pseudo labels in the target domain by proposing an unsupervised framework, Mutual Mean-Teaching (MMT), to learn better features from the target domain via off-line refined hard pseudo labels and on-line refined soft pseudo labels in an alternative training manner.  In addition, the common practice is to adopt both the classification loss and the triplet loss jointly for achieving optimal performances in person re-ID models. However, conventional triplet loss cannot work with softly refined labels. To solve this problem, a novel soft softmax-triplet loss is proposed to support learning with soft pseudo triplet labels for achieving the optimal domain adaptation performance. The proposed MMT framework achieves considerable improvements of 14.4%, 18.2%, 13.1% and 16.4% mAP on Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.
10	Representation learning promises to unlock deep learning for the long tail of vision tasks without expansive labelled datasets. Yet, the absence of a unified yardstick to evaluate general visual representations hinders progress. Many sub-fields promise representations, but each has different evaluation protocols that are either too constrained (linear classification), limited in scope (ImageNet, CIFAR, Pascal-VOC), or only loosely related to representation quality (generation). We present the Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB): a diverse, realistic, and challenging benchmark to evaluate representations. VTAB embodies one principle: good representations adapt to unseen tasks with few examples. We run a large VTAB study of popular algorithms, answering questions like: How effective are ImageNet representation on non-standard datasets? Are generative models competitive? Is self-supervision useful if one already has labels?
01	We present a method that trains large capacity neural networks with significantly improved accuracy and lower dynamic computational cost. This is achieved by gating the deep-learning architecture on a fine-grained-level. Individual convolutional maps are turned on/off conditionally on features in the network. To achieve this, we introduce a new residual block architecture that gates convolutional channels in a fine-grained manner. We also introduce a generally applicable tool batch-shaping that matches the marginal aggregate posteriors of features in a neural network to a pre-specified prior distribution. We use this novel technique to force gates to be more conditional on the data. We present results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets for image classification, and Cityscapes for semantic segmentation. Our results show that our method can slim down large architectures conditionally, such that the average computational cost on the data is on par with a smaller architecture, but with higher accuracy. In particular, on ImageNet, our ResNet50 and ResNet34 gated networks obtain 74.60% and 72.55% top-1 accuracy compared to the 69.76% accuracy of the baseline ResNet18 model, for similar complexity. We also show that the resulting networks automatically learn to use more features for difficult examples and fewer features for simple examples.
10	Exploration while learning representations is one of the main challenges DeepReinforcement Learning (DRL) faces today. As the learned representation is dependant in the observed data, the exploration strategy has a crucial role. The popular DQN algorithm has improved significantly the capabilities of ReinforcementLearning (RL) algorithms to learn state representations from raw data, yet, it usesa naive exploration strategy which is statistically inefficient. The RandomizedLeast Squares Value Iteration (RLSVI) algorithm (Osband et al., 2016), on theother hand, explores and generalizes efficiently via linearly parameterized valuefunctions. However, it is based on hand-designed state representation that requiresprior engineering work for every environment. In this paper, we propose a DeepLearning adaptation for RLSVI. Rather than using hand-design state representation, we use a state representation that is being learned directly from the data by aDQN agent. As the representation is being optimized during the learning process,a key component for the suggested method is a likelihood matching mechanism,which adapts to the changing representations. We demonstrate the importance ofthe various properties of our algorithm on a toy problem and show that our methodoutperforms DQN in five Atari benchmarks, reaching competitive results with theRainbow algorithm.
10	Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) is the task of producing a high resolution (HR) image from a given low-resolution (LR) image. It is a well researched prob- lem with extensive commercial applications like digital camera, video compres- sion, medical imaging, etc. Most recent super resolution works focus on the fea- ture learning architecture, like Chao Dong (2016); Dong et al. (2016); Wang et al. (2018b); Ledig et al. (2017). However, these works suffer from the following chal- lenges: (1) The low-resolution (LR) training images are artificially synthesized us- ing HR images with bicubic downsampling, which have much more information than real demosaic-upscaled images. The mismatch between training and realistic mobile data heavily blocks the effect on practical SR problem. (2) These methods cannot effectively handle the blind distortions during super resolution in practical applications. In this work, an end-to-end novel framework, including high-to-low network and low-to-high network, is proposed to solve the above problems with dual Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). First, the above mismatch prob- lems are well explored with the high-to-low network, where clear high-resolution image and the corresponding realistic low-resolution image pairs can be gener- ated. With high-to-low network, a large-scale General Mobile Super Resolution Dataset, GMSR, is proposed, which can be utilized for training or as a bench- mark for super resolution methods. Second, an effective low-to-high network (super resolution network) is proposed in the framework. Benefiting from the GMSR dataset and novel training strategies, the proposed super resolution model can effectively handle detail recovery and denoising at the same time.
10	Domain adaptation is critical for success in new, unseen environments.Adversarial adaptation models applied in feature spaces discover domain invariant representations, but are difficult to visualize and sometimes fail to capture pixel-level and low-level domain shifts.Recent work has shown that generative adversarial networks combined with cycle-consistency constraints are surprisingly effective at  mapping images between domains, even without the use of aligned image pairs.We propose a novel discriminatively-trained Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Domain Adaptation model.CyCADA adapts representations at both the pixel-level and feature-level, enforces cycle-consistency while leveraging a task loss, and does not require aligned pairs.  Our model can be applied in a variety of visual recognition and prediction settings.We show new state-of-the-art results across multiple adaptation tasks, including digit classification and semantic segmentation of road scenes demonstrating transfer from synthetic to real world domains.
10	Saliency map, or the gradient of the score function with respect to the input, is the most basic means of interpreting deep neural network decisions. However, saliency maps are often visually noisy. Although several hypotheses were proposed to account for this phenomenon, there is no work that provides a rigorous analysis of noisy saliency maps. This may be a problem as numerous advanced attribution methods were proposed under the assumption that the existing hypotheses are true. In this paper, we identify the cause of noisy saliency maps. Then, we propose Rectified Gradient, a simple method that significantly improves saliency maps by alleviating that cause. Experiments showed effectiveness of our method and its superiority to other attribution methods. Codes and examples for the experiments will be released in public.
10	"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning is a popular method to exploit temporal abstractions in order to tackle the curse of dimensionality. The options framework is one such hierarchical framework that models the notion of skills or options. However, learning a collection of task-agnostic transferable skills is a challenging task. Option discovery typically entails using heuristics, the majority of which revolve around discovering bottleneck states. In this work, we adopt a method complementary to the idea of discovering bottlenecks. Instead, we attempt to discover ``landmark"" sub-goals which are prototypical states of well connected regions. These sub-goals are points from which densely connected set of states are easily accessible. We propose a new model called Successor options that leverages Successor Representations to achieve the same. We also design a novel pseudo-reward for learning the intra-option policies. Additionally, we describe an Incremental Successor options model that iteratively builds options and explores in environments where exploration through primitive actions is inadequate to form the Successor Representations. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a collection of grid worlds and on complex high dimensional environments like Deepmind-Lab."
10	The goal of survival clustering is to map subjects (e.g., users in a social network, patients in a medical study) to $K$ clusters ranging from low-risk to high-risk. Existing survival methods assume the presence of clear \textit{end-of-life} signals or introduce them artificially using a pre-defined timeout. In this paper, we forego this assumption and introduce a loss function that differentiates between the empirical lifetime distributions of the clusters using a modified Kuiper statistic. We learn a deep neural network by optimizing this loss, that performs a soft clustering of users into survival groups. We apply our method to a social network dataset with over 1M subjects, and show significant improvement in C-index compared to alternatives.
01	Eliciting labels from crowds is a potential way to obtain large labeled data. Despite a variety of methods developed for learning from crowds, a key challenge remains unsolved: \emph{learning from crowds without knowing the information structure among the crowds a priori, when some people of the crowds make highly correlated mistakes and some of them label effortlessly (e.g. randomly)}. We propose an information theoretic approach, Max-MIG, for joint learning from crowds, with a common assumption: the crowdsourced labels and the data are independent conditioning on the ground truth. Max-MIG simultaneously aggregates the crowdsourced labels and learns an accurate data classifier. Furthermore, we devise an accurate data-crowds forecaster that employs both the data and the crowdsourced labels to forecast the ground truth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that solves the aforementioned challenge of learning from crowds. In addition to the theoretical validation, we also empirically show that our algorithm achieves the new state-of-the-art results in most settings, including the real-world data, and is the first algorithm that is robust to various information structures. Codes are available at https://github.com/Newbeeer/Max-MIG .
01	Recent studies have shown that many important aspects of neural network learning take place within the very earliest iterations or epochs of training. For example, sparse, trainable sub-networks emerge (Frankle et al., 2019), gradient descent moves into a small subspace (Gur-Ari et al., 2018), and the network undergoes a critical period (Achille et al., 2019). Here we examine the changes that deep neural networks undergo during this early phase of training. We perform extensive measurements of the network state and its updates during these early iterations of training, and leverage the framework of Frankle et al. (2019) to quantitatively probe the weight distribution and its reliance on various aspects of the dataset. We find that, within this framework, deep networks are not robust to reinitializing with random weights while maintaining signs, and that weight distributions are highly non-independent even after only a few hundred iterations. Despite this, pre-training with blurred inputs or an auxiliary self-supervised task can approximate the changes in supervised networks, suggesting that these changes are label-agnostic, though labels significantly accelerate this process. Together, these results help to elucidate the network changes occurring during this pivotal initial period of learning.
10	We focus on the problem of black-box adversarial attacks, where the aim is to generate adversarial examples using information limited to loss function evaluations of input-output pairs. We use Bayesian optimization (BO) to specificallycater to scenarios involving low query budgets to develop query efficient adversarial attacks. We alleviate the issues surrounding BO in regards to optimizing high dimensional deep learning models by effective dimension upsampling techniques. Our proposed approach achieves performance comparable to the state of the art black-box adversarial attacks albeit with a much lower average query count. In particular, in low query budget regimes, our proposed method reduces the query count up to 80% with respect to the state of the art methods.
10	Interpretability has largely focused on local explanations, i.e. explaining why a model made a particular prediction for a sample. These explanations are appealing due to their simplicity and local fidelity. However, they do not provide information about the general behavior of the model. We propose to leverage model distillation to learn global additive explanations that describe the relationship between input features and model predictions. These global explanations take the form of feature shapes, which are more expressive than feature attributions. Through careful experimentation, we show qualitatively and quantitatively that global additive explanations are able to describe model behavior and yield insights about models such as neural nets. A visualization of our approach applied to a neural net as it is trained is available at https://youtu.be/ErQYwNqzEdc
01	Self-supervised learning is showing great promise for monocular depth estimation, using geometry as the only source of supervision. Depth networks are indeed capable of learning representations that relate visual appearance to 3D properties by implicitly leveraging category-level patterns. In this work we investigate how to leverage more directly this semantic structure to guide geometric representation learning, while remaining in the self-supervised regime. Instead of using semantic labels and proxy losses in a multi-task approach, we propose a new architecture leveraging fixed pretrained semantic segmentation networks to guide self-supervised representation learning via pixel-adaptive convolutions. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training process to overcome a common semantic bias on dynamic objects via resampling. Our method improves upon the state of the art for self-supervised monocular depth prediction over all pixels, fine-grained details, and per semantic categories.
10	Domain adaptation is an open problem in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Often, agents are asked to perform in environments where data is difficult to obtain. In such settings, agents are trained in similar environments, such as simulators, and are then transferred to the original environment. The gap between visual observations of the source and target environments often causes the agent to fail in the target environment. We present a new RL agent, SADALA (Soft Attention DisentAngled representation Learning Agent). SADALA first learns a compressed state representation. It then jointly learns to ignore distracting features and solve the task presented. SADALA's separation of important and unimportant visual features leads to robust domain transfer. SADALA outperforms both prior disentangled-representation based RL and domain randomization approaches across RL environments (Visual Cartpole and DeepMind Lab).
01	Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are popular and flexible models for real-world decision-making applications that demand the information from past observations to make optimal decisions. Standard reinforcement learning algorithms for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDP) tasks are not applicable, as they cannot infer the unobserved states. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for POMDPs, named sequential variational soft Q-learning networks (SVQNs), which formalizes the inference of hidden states and maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MERL) under a unified graphical model and optimizes the two modules jointly. We further design a deep recurrent neural network to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. Experimental results show that SVQNs can utilize past information to help decision making for efficient inference, and outperforms other baselines on several challenging tasks. Our ablation study shows that SVQNs have the generalization ability over time and are robust to the disturbance of the observation.
10	We consider the problem of representation learning for graph data. Convolutional neural networks can naturally operate on images, but have significant challenges in dealing with graph data. Given images are special cases of graphs with nodes lie on 2D lattices, graph embedding tasks have a natural correspondence with image pixel-wise prediction tasks such as segmentation. While encoder-decoder architectures like U-Net have been successfully applied on many image pixel-wise prediction tasks, similar methods are lacking for graph data. This is due to the fact that pooling and up-sampling operations are not natural on graph data. To address these challenges, we propose novel graph pooling (gPool) and unpooling (gUnpool) operations in this work. The gPool layer adaptively selects some nodes to form a smaller graph based on their scalar projection values on a trainable projection vector. We further propose the gUnpool layer as the inverse operation of the gPool layer. The gUnpool layer restores the graph into its original structure using the position information of nodes selected in the corresponding gPool layer. Based on our proposed gPool and gUnpool layers, we develop an encoder-decoder model on graph, known as the graph U-Net. Our experimental results on node classification tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve consistently better performance than previous models.
01	In recent years, deep neural network approaches have been widely adopted for machine learning tasks, including classification. However, they were shown to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations: carefully crafted small perturbations can cause misclassification of legitimate images. We propose Defense-GAN, a new framework leveraging the expressive capability of generative models to defend deep neural networks against such attacks. Defense-GAN is trained to model the distribution of unperturbed images. At inference time, it finds a close output to a given image which does not contain the adversarial changes. This output is then fed to the classifier. Our proposed method can be used with any classification model and does not modify the classifier structure or training procedure. It can also be used as a defense against any attack as it does not assume knowledge of the process for generating the adversarial examples. We empirically show that Defense-GAN is consistently effective against different attack methods and improves on existing defense strategies.
10	In the adversarial-perturbation problem of neural networks, an adversary starts with a neural network model $F$ and a point $\bfx$ that $F$ classifies correctly, and applies a \emph{small perturbation} to  $\bfx$ to produce another point $\bfx'$ that $F$ classifies \emph{incorrectly}.  In this paper, we propose taking into account \emph{the inherent confidence information} produced by models when studying adversarial perturbations, where a natural measure of ``confidence'' is \|F(\bfx)\|_\infty$ (i.e. how confident $F$ is about its prediction?). Motivated by a thought experiment based on the manifold assumption, we propose a ``goodness property'' of models which states that \emph{confident regions of a good model should be well separated}. We give formalizations of this property and examine existing robust training objectives in view of them. Interestingly, we find that a recent objective by Madry et al. encourages training a model that satisfies well our formal version of the goodness property, but has a weak control of points that are wrong but with low confidence. However, if Madry et al.'s model is indeed a good solution to their objective, then good and bad points are now distinguishable and we can try to embed uncertain points back to the closest confident region to get (hopefully) correct predictions. We thus propose embedding objectives and algorithms, and perform an empirical study using this method. Our experimental results are encouraging: Madry et al.'s model wrapped with our embedding procedure achieves almost perfect success rate in defending against attacks that the base model fails on, while retaining good generalization behavior.
10	Reinforcement learning in an actor-critic setting relies on accurate value estimates of the critic. However, the combination of function approximation, temporal difference (TD) learning and off-policy training can lead to an overestimating value function. A solution is to use Clipped Double Q-learning (CDQ), which is used in the TD3 algorithm and computes the minimum of two critics in the TD-target. We show that CDQ induces an underestimation bias and propose a new algorithm that accounts for this by using a weighted average of the target from CDQ and the target coming from a single critic.The weighting parameter is adjusted during training such that the value estimates match the actual discounted return on the most recent episodes and by that it balances over- and underestimation.Empirically, we obtain more accurate value estimates and demonstrate state of the art results on several OpenAI gym tasks.
10	While momentum-based methods, in conjunction with the stochastic gradient descent, are widely used when training machine learning models, there is little theoretical understanding on the generalization error of such methods. In practice, the momentum parameter is often chosen in a heuristic fashion with little theoretical guidance. In this work, we use the framework of algorithmic stability to provide an upper-bound on the generalization error for the class of strongly convex loss functions, under mild technical assumptions. Our bound decays to zero inversely with the size of the training set, and increases as the momentum parameter is increased. We also develop an upper-bound on the expected true risk,  in terms of the number of training steps, the size of the training set, and the momentum parameter.
