10	Unsupervised image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping between several visual domains by using unpaired training pairs. Recent studies have shown remarkable success in image-to-image translation for multiple domains but they suffer from two main limitations: they are either built from several two-domain mappings that are required to be learned independently and/or they generate low-diversity results, a phenomenon known as model collapse. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method named GMM-UNIT based on a content-attribute disentangled representation, where the attribute space is fitted with a GMM. Each GMM component represents a domain, and this simple assumption has two prominent advantages. First, the dimension of the attribute space does not grow linearly with the number of domains, as it is the case in the literature. Second, the continuous domain encoding allows for interpolation between domains and for extrapolation to unseen domains. Additionally, we show how GMM-UNIT can be constrained down to different methods in the literature, meaning that GMM-UNIT is a unifying framework for unsupervised image-to-image translation.
10	Imitation learning algorithms provide a simple and straightforward approach for training control policies via standard supervised learning methods. By maximizing the likelihood of good actions provided by an expert demonstrator, supervised imitation learning can produce effective policies without the algorithmic complexities and optimization challenges of reinforcement learning, at the cost of requiring an expert demonstrator -- typically a person -- to provide the demonstrations. In this paper, we ask: can we use imitation learning to train effective policies without any expert demonstrations? The key observation that makes this possible is that, in the multi-task setting, trajectories that are generated by a suboptimal policy can still serve as optimal examples for other tasks. In particular, in the setting where the tasks correspond to different goals, every trajectory is a successful demonstration for the state that it actually reaches. Informed by this observation, we propose a very simple algorithm for learning behaviors without any demonstrations, user-provided reward functions, or complex reinforcement learning methods. Our method simply maximizes the likelihood of actions the agent actually took in its own previous rollouts, conditioned on the goal being the state that it actually reached. Although related variants of this approach have been proposed previously in imitation learning settings with example demonstrations, we present the first instance of this approach as a method for learning goal-reaching policies entirely from scratch. We present a theoretical result linking self-supervised imitation learning and reinforcement learning, and empirical results showing that it performs competitively with more complex reinforcement learning methods on a range of challenging goal reaching problems.
10	Variational inference is a fundamental problem in Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). The optimization with lower bound of marginal log-likelihood results in the distribution of latent variables approximate to a given prior probability, which is the dilemma of employing VAE to solve real-world problems. By virtue of high-dimensional geometry, we propose a very simple algorithm completely different from existing ones to alleviate the variational inference in VAE. We analyze the unique characteristics of random variables on spheres in high dimensions and prove that Wasserstein distance between two arbitrary data sets randomly drawn from a sphere are nearly identical when the dimension is sufficiently large. Based on our theory, a novel algorithm for distribution-robust sampling is devised. Moreover, we reform the latent space of VAE by constraining latent variables on the sphere, thus freeing VAE from the approximate optimization of posterior probability via variational inference. The new algorithm is named Spherical AutoEncoder (SAE). Extensive experiments by sampling and inference tasks validate our theoretical analysis and the superiority of SAE.
10	Randomized smoothing, which was recently proved to be a certified defensive technique, has received considerable attention due to its scalability to large datasets and neural networks. However, several important questions still remain unanswered in the existing frameworks, such as (i) whether Gaussian mechanism is an optimal choice for certifying $\ell_2$-normed robustness, and (ii) whether randomized smoothing can certify $\ell_\infty$-normed robustness (on high-dimensional datasets like ImageNet). To answer these questions, we introduce a {\em  unified} and {\em self-contained} framework to study randomized smoothing-based certified defenses, where we mainly focus on the two most popular norms in adversarial machine learning, {\em i.e.,} $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ norm. We answer the above two questions by first demonstrating that Gaussian mechanism and  Exponential mechanism are the (near) optimal options to certify the $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$-normed robustness. We further show that the largest $\ell_\infty$ radius certified by randomized smoothing is upper bounded by $O(1/\sqrt{d})$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. This theoretical finding suggests that certifying $\ell_\infty$-normed robustness by randomized smoothing may not be scalable to high-dimensional data. The veracity of our framework and analysis is verified by extensive evaluations on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.
10	Recently, the paradigm of unfolding iterative algorithms into finite-length feed-forward neural networks has achieved a great success in the area of sparse recovery. Benefit from available training data, the learned networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in respect of both speed and accuracy. However, the structure behind sparsity, imposing constraint on the support of sparse signals, is often an essential prior knowledge but seldom considered in the existing networks. In this paper, we aim at bridging this gap. Specifically, exploiting the iterative reweighted $\ell_1$ minimization (IRL1) algorithm, we propose to learn the cluster structured sparsity (CSS) by rewegihting adaptively. In particular, we first unfold the Reweighted Iterative Shrinkage Algorithm (RwISTA) into an end-to-end trainable deep architecture termed as RW-LISTA. Then instead of the element-wise reweighting, the global and local reweighting manner are proposed for the cluster structured sparse learning. Numerical experiments further show the superiority of our algorithm against both classical algorithms and learning-based networks on different tasks. 
10	Recently Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has aroused great interest in both academia and industry, however it remains challenging because of its huge and non-continuous search space. Instead of applying evolutionary algorithm or reinforcement learning as previous works, this paper proposes a Direct Sparse Optimization NAS (DSO-NAS) method. In DSO-NAS, we provide a novel model pruning view to NAS problem. In specific, we start from a completely connected block, and then introduce scaling factors to scale the information flow between operations. Next, we impose sparse regularizations to prune useless connections in the architecture. Lastly, we derive an efficient and theoretically sound optimization method to solve it. Our method enjoys both advantages of differentiability and efficiency, therefore can be directly applied to large datasets like ImageNet. Particularly, On CIFAR-10 dataset, DSO-NAS achieves an average test error 2.84%, while on the ImageNet dataset DSO-NAS achieves 25.4% test error under 600M FLOPs with 8 GPUs in 18 hours.
10	Extractive summarization methods operate by ranking and selecting the sentences which best encapsulate the theme of a given document. They do not fare well in domains like fictional narratives where there is no central theme and core information is not encapsulated by a small set of sentences. For the purpose of reducing the size of the document while conveying the idea expressed by each sentence, we need more sentence specific methods. Telegraphic summarization, which selects short segments across several sentences, is better suited for such domains. Telegraphic summarization captures the plot better by retaining shorter versions of each sentence while not really concerning itself with grammatically linking these segments. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning network (NUTS) to generate telegraphic summaries.We use multiple encoder-decoder networks and learn to drop portions of the text that are inferable from the chosen segments. The model is agnostic to both sentence length and style. We demonstrate that the summaries produced by our model show significant quantitative and qualitative improvement over those produced by existing methods and baselines.
10	Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are one of the most popular algorithms for classification and regression analysis. Despite their popularity, even efficient implementations have proven to be computationally expensive to train at a large-scale, especially in streaming settings. In this paper, we propose a novel coreset construction algorithm for efficiently generating compact representations of massive data sets to speed up SVM training. A coreset is a weighted subset of the original data points such that SVMs trained on the coreset are provably competitive with those trained on the original (massive) data set. We provide both lower and upper bounds on the number of samples required to obtain accurate approximations to the SVM problem as a function of the complexity of the input data. Our analysis also establishes sufficient conditions on the existence of sufficiently compact and representative coresets for the SVM problem. We empirically evaluate the practical effectiveness of our algorithm against synthetic and real-world data sets.
10	Dynamical system models (including RNNs) often lack the ability to adapt the sequence generation or prediction to a given context, limiting their real-world application. In this paper we show that hierarchical multi-task dynamical systems (MTDSs) provide direct user control over sequence generation, via use of a latent  code z that specifies the customization to theindividual data sequence. This enables style transfer, interpolation and morphing within generated sequences. We show the MTDS can improve predictions via latent code interpolation, and avoid the long-term performance degradation of standard RNN approaches.
10	Extracting underlying dynamics of objects in image sequences is one of the challenging problems in computer vision. On the other hand, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has recently attracted attention as a way of obtaining modal representations of nonlinear dynamics from (general multivariate time-series) data without explicit prior knowledge about the dynamics. In this paper, we propose a convolutional autoencoder based DMD (CAE-DMD) that is an extended DMD (EDMD) approach, to extract underlying dynamics in videos. To this end, we develop a modified CAE model by incorporating DMD on the encoder, which gives a more meaningful compressed representation of input image sequences. On the reconstruction side, a decoder is used to minimize the reconstruction error after applying the DMD, which in result gives an accurate reconstruction of inputs. We empirically investigated the performance of CAE-DMD in two applications: background/foreground extraction and video classification, on publicly available datasets.
10	This paper proposes variational domain adaptation, a unified, scalable, simple framework for learning multiple distributions through variational inference. Unlike the existing methods on domain transfer through deep generative models, such as StarGAN (Choi et al., 2017) and UFDN (Liu et al., 2018), the variational domain adaptation has three advantages. Firstly, the  samples from the target are not required. Instead, the framework requires one known source as a prior $p(x)$ and binary discriminators, $p(\mathcal{D}_i|x)$, discriminating the target domain $\mathcal{D}_i$ from others. Consequently, the framework regards a target as a posterior that can be explicitly formulated through the Bayesian inference, $p(x|\mathcal{D}_i) \propto p(\mathcal{D}_i|x)p(x)$, as exhibited by a further proposed model of dual variational autoencoder (DualVAE). Secondly, the framework is scablable to large-scale domains. As well as VAE encodes a sample $x$ as a mode on a latent space: $\mu(x) \in \mathcal{Z}$, DualVAE encodes a domain $\mathcal{D}_i$ as a mode on the dual latent space $\mu^*(\mathcal{D}_i) \in \mathcal{Z}^*$, named domain embedding. It reformulates the posterior with a natural paring $\langle, \rangle: \mathcal{Z} \times \mathcal{Z}^* \rightarrow \Real$, which can be expanded to uncountable infinite domains such as continuous domains as well as interpolation. Thirdly, DualVAE fastly converges without sophisticated automatic/manual hyperparameter search in comparison to GANs as it requires only one additional parameter to VAE. Through the numerical experiment, we demonstrate the three benefits with multi-domain image generation task on CelebA with up to 60 domains, and exhibits that DualVAE records the state-of-the-art performance outperforming StarGAN and UFDN.
10	Representations learnt through deep neural networks tend to be highly informative, but opaque in terms of what information they learn to encode. We introduce an approach to probabilistic modelling that learns to represent data with two separate deep representations: an invariant representation that encodes the information of the class from which the data belongs, and an equivariant representation that encodes the symmetry transformation defining the particular data point within the class manifold (equivariant in the sense that the representation varies naturally with symmetry transformations). This approach to representation learning is conceptually transparent, easy to implement, and in-principle generally applicable to any data comprised of discrete classes of continuous distributions (e.g. objects in images, topics in language, individuals in behavioural data). We demonstrate qualitatively compelling representation learning and competitive quantitative performance, in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, versus comparable modelling approaches in the literature with little fine tuning.
10	We present a proof of convergence for ReLU networks trained with weight normalization. In the analysis, we consider over-parameterized 2-layer ReLU networks initialized at random and trained with batch gradient descent and a fixed step size. The proof builds on recent theoretical works that bound the trajectory of parameters from their initialization and monitor the network predictions via the evolution of a ''neural tangent kernel'' (Jacot et al. 2018).  We discover that training with weight normalization decomposes such a kernel via the so called ''length-direction decoupling''.  This in turn leads to two convergence regimes and can rigorously explain the utility of WeightNorm. From the modified convergence we make a few curious observations including a natural form of ''lazy training'' where the direction of each weight vector remains stationary. 
10	"In this paper, we investigate the underlying factor that leads to the failure and success in training of GANs. Specifically, we study the property of the optimal discriminative function $f^*(x)$ and show that $f^*(x)$ in most GANs can only reflect the local densities at $x$, which means the value of $f^*(x)$ for points in the fake distribution ($P_g$) does not contain any information useful about the location of other points in the real distribution ($P_r$). Given that the supports of the real and fake distributions are usually disjoint, we argue that such a $f^*(x)$ and its gradient tell nothing about ""how to pull $P_g$ to $P_r$"", which turns out to be the fundamental cause of failure in training of GANs. We further demonstrate that a well-defined distance metric (including the dual form of Wasserstein distance with a compacted constraint) does not necessarily ensure the convergence of GANs. Finally, we propose Lipschitz-continuity condition as a general solution and show that in a large family of GAN objectives, Lipschitz condition is capable of connecting $P_g$ and $P_r$ through $f^*(x)$ such that the gradient $\nabla_{\!x}f^*(x)$ at each sample $x \sim P_g$ points towards some real sample $y \sim P_r$."
10	Label Propagation (LPA) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) are both message passing algorithms on graphs. Both solve the task of node classification but LPA propagates node label information across the edges of the graph, while GCN propagates and transforms node feature information. However, while conceptually similar, theoretical relation between LPA and GCN has not yet been investigated. Here we study the relationship between LPA and GCN in terms of two aspects: (1) feature/label smoothing where we analyze how the feature/label of one node are spread over its neighbors; And, (2) feature/label influence of how much the initial feature/label of one node influences the final feature/label of another node. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose an end-to-end model that unifies GCN and LPA for node classification. In our unified model, edge weights are learnable, and the LPA serves as regularization to assist the GCN in learning proper edge weights that lead to improved classification performance. Our model can also be seen as learning attention weights based on node labels, which is more task-oriented than existing feature-based attention models. In a number of experiments on real-world graphs, our model shows superiority over state-of-the-art GCN-based methods in terms of node classification accuracy.
10	We introduce HyperGAN, a generative network that learns to generate all the weight parameters of deep neural networks. HyperGAN first transforms low dimensional noise into a latent space, which can be sampled from to obtain diverse, performant sets of parameters for a target architecture. We utilize an architecture that bears resemblance to generative adversarial networks, but we evaluate the likelihood of samples with a classification loss. This is equivalent to minimizing the KL-divergence between the generated network parameter distribution and an unknown true parameter distribution. We apply HyperGAN to classification, showing that HyperGAN can learn to generate parameters which solve the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with competitive performance to fully supervised learning while learning a rich distribution of effective parameters. We also show that HyperGAN can also provide better uncertainty than standard ensembles. This is evaluated by the ability of HyperGAN-generated ensembles to detect out of distribution data as well as adversarial examples. We see that in addition to being highly accurate on inlier data, HyperGAN can provide reasonable uncertainty estimates. 
10	The Transformer architecture is popularly used in natural language processing tasks. To train a Transformer model, a carefully designed learning rate warm-up stage is usually needed: the learning rate has to be set to an extremely small value at the beginning of the optimization and then gradually increases in some given number of iterations. Such a stage is shown to be crucial to the final performance and brings more hyper-parameter tunings. In this paper, we study why the learning rate warm-up stage is important in training the Transformer and theoretically show that the location of layer normalization matters. It can be proved that at the beginning of the optimization, for the original Transformer, which places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large. Then using a large learning rate on those gradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful to avoid this problem. Such an analysis motivates us to investigate a slightly modified Transformer architecture which locates the layer normalization inside the residual blocks. We show that the gradients in this Transformer architecture are well-behaved at initialization. Given these findings,  we are the first to show that this Transformer variant is easier and faster to train. The learning rate warm-up stage can be safely removed, and the training time can be largely reduced on a wide range of applications.
10	Most of the existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the mere extension of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to graphs. Generally, they consist of several steps of message passing between the nodes followed by a global indiscriminate feature pooling function. In many data-sets, however, the nodes are unlabeled or their labels provide no information about the similarity between the nodes and the locations of the nodes in the graph. Accordingly, message passing may not propagate helpful information throughout the graph. We show that this conventional approach can fail to learn to perform even simple graph classification tasks. We alleviate this serious shortcoming of the GNNs by making them a two step method. In the first of the proposed approach, a graph embedding algorithm is utilized to obtain a continuous feature vector for each node of the graph. The embedding algorithm represents the graph as a point-cloud in the embedding space. In the second step, the GNN is applied to the point-cloud representation of the graph provided by the embedding method. The GNN learns to perform the given task by inferring the topological structure of the graph encoded in the spatial distribution of the embedded vectors. In addition, we extend the proposed approach to the graph clustering problem and a new architecture for graph clustering is proposed. Moreover, the spatial representation of the graph is utilized to design a graph pooling algorithm. We turn the problem of graph down-sampling into a column sampling problem, i.e., the sampling algorithm selects a subset of the nodes whose feature vectors preserve the spatial distribution of all the feature vectors. We apply the proposed approach to several popular benchmark data-sets and it is shown that the proposed geometrical approach strongly improves the state-of-the-art result for several data-sets. For instance, for the PTC data-set, we improve the state-of-the-art result for more than 22 %.
01	Graph matching aims to establishing node-wise correspondence between two graphs, which is a classic combinatorial problem and in general NP-complete. Until very recently, deep graph matching methods start to resort to deep networks to achieve unprecedented matching accuracy. Along this direction, this paper makes two complementary contributions which can also be reused as plugin in existing works: i) a novel node and edge embedding strategy which stimulates the multi-head strategy in attention models and allows the information in each channel to be merged independently. In contrast, only node embedding is accounted in previous works; ii) a general masking mechanism over the loss function is devised to improve the smoothness of objective learning for graph matching. Using Hungarian algorithm, it dynamically constructs a structured and sparsely connected layer, taking into account the most contributing matching pairs as hard attention. Our approach performs competitively, and can also improve state-of-the-art methods as plugin, regarding with matching accuracy on three public benchmarks.
01	Weight pruning has been introduced as an efficient model compression technique. Even though pruning removes significant amount of weights in a network, memory requirement reduction was limited since conventional sparse matrix formats require significant amount of memory to store index-related information. Moreover, computations associated with such sparse matrix formats are slow because sequential sparse matrix decoding process does not utilize highly parallel computing systems efficiently. As an attempt to compress index information while keeping the decoding process parallelizable, Viterbi-based pruning was suggested. Decoding non-zero weights, however, is still sequential in Viterbi-based pruning. In this paper, we propose a new sparse matrix format in order to enable a highly parallel decoding process of the entire sparse matrix. The proposed sparse matrix is constructed by combining pruning and weight quantization. For the latest RNN models on PTB and WikiText-2 corpus, LSTM parameter storage requirement is compressed 19x using the proposed sparse matrix format compared to the baseline model. Compressed weight and indices can be reconstructed into a dense matrix fast using Viterbi encoders. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can feed parameters to processing elements 20 % to 106 % faster than the case where the dense matrix values directly come from DRAM.
01	Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is state of the art in large scale distributed training. The scheme can reach a linear speed-up with respect to the number of workers, but this is rarely seen in practice as the scheme often suffers from large network delays and bandwidth limits. To overcome this communication bottleneck recent works propose to reduce the communication frequency. An algorithm of this type is local SGD that runs SGD independently in parallel on different workers and averages the sequences only once in a while. This scheme shows promising results in practice, but eluded thorough theoretical analysis.    We prove concise convergence rates for local SGD on convex problems and show that it converges at the same rate as mini-batch SGD in terms of number of evaluated gradients, that is, the scheme achieves linear speed-up in the number of workers and mini-batch size. The number of  communication rounds can be reduced up to a factor of T^{1/2}---where T denotes the number of total steps---compared to mini-batch SGD. This also holds for asynchronous implementations.Local SGD can also be used for large scale training of deep learning models. The results shown here aim serving as a guideline to further explore the theoretical and practical aspects of local SGD in these applications.
01	We consider reinforcement learning in input-driven environments, where an exogenous, stochastic input process affects the dynamics of the system. Input processes arise in many applications, including queuing systems, robotics control with disturbances, and object tracking. Since the state dynamics and rewards depend on the input process, the state alone provides limited information for the expected future returns. Therefore, policy gradient methods with standard state-dependent baselines suffer high variance during training. We derive a bias-free, input-dependent baseline to reduce this variance, and analytically show its benefits over state-dependent baselines. We then propose a meta-learning approach to overcome the complexity of learning a baseline that depends on a long sequence of inputs. Our experimental results show that across environments from queuing systems, computer networks, and MuJoCo robotic locomotion, input-dependent baselines consistently improve training stability and result in better eventual policies.
01	We propose DeepV2D, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for predicting depth from video.  DeepV2D combines the representation ability of neural networks with the geometric principles governing image formation. We compose a collection of classical geometric algorithms, which are converted into trainable modules and combined into an end-to-end differentiable architecture. DeepV2D interleaves two stages: motion estimation and depth estimation. During inference, motion and depth estimation are alternated and converge to accurate depth. 
10	We propose a new architecture termed Dual Adversarial Transfer Network (DATNet) for addressing low-resource Named Entity Recognition (NER). Specifically, two variants of DATNet, i.e., DATNet-F and DATNet-P, are proposed to explore effective feature fusion between high and low resource. To address the noisy and imbalanced training data, we propose a novel Generalized Resource-Adversarial Discriminator (GRAD). Additionally, adversarial training is adopted to boost model generalization. We examine the effects of different components in DATNet across domains and languages and show that significant improvement can be obtained especially for low-resource data. Without augmenting any additional hand-crafted features, we achieve new state-of-the-art performances on CoNLL and Twitter NER---88.16% F1 for Spanish, 53.43% F1 for WNUT-2016, and 42.83% F1 for WNUT-2017.
10	Training certifiable neural networks enables one to obtain models with robustness guarantees against adversarial attacks. In this work, we use a linear approximation to bound model’s output given an input adversarial budget. This allows us to bound the adversary-free region in the data neighborhood by a polyhedral envelope and yields finer-grained certified robustness than existing methods. We further exploit this certifier to introduce a framework called polyhedral envelope regular- ization (PER), which encourages larger polyhedral envelopes and thus improves the provable robustness of the models. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework on standard benchmarks; it applies to networks with general activation functions and obtains comparable or better robustness guarantees than state-of-the-art methods, with very little cost in clean accuracy, i.e., without over-regularizing the model.
10	In this paper, we consider the problem of learning a policy by observing numerous non-expert agents. Our goal is to extract a policy that, with high-confidence, acts better than the agents' average performance. Such a setting is important for real-world problems where expert data is scarce but non-expert data can easily be obtained, e.g. by crowdsourcing. Our approach is to pose this problem as safe policy improvement in reinforcement learning. First, we evaluate an average behavior policy and approximate its value function. Then, we develop a stochastic policy improvement algorithm that safely improves the average behavior. The primary advantages of our approach, termed Rerouted Behavior Improvement (RBI), over other safe learning methods are its stability in the presence of value estimation errors and the elimination of a policy search process.  We demonstrate these advantages in the Taxi grid-world domain and in four games from the Atari learning environment.
10	Characterizing the underlying mechanism of graph topological evolution from a source graph to a target graph has attracted fast increasing attention in the deep graph learning domain. However, there lacks expressive and efficient that can handle global and local evolution patterns between source and target graphs. On the other hand, graph topological evolution has been investigated in the graph signal processing domain historically, but it involves intensive labors to manually determine suitable prescribed spectral models and prohibitive difficulty to fit their potential combinations and compositions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the deep Graph Spectral Evolution Network (GSEN) for modeling the graph topology evolution problem by the composition of newly-developed generalized graph kernels. GSEN can effectively fit a wide range of existing graph kernels and their combinations and compositions with the theoretical guarantee and experimental verification. GSEN has outstanding efficiency in terms of time complexity ($O(n)$) and parameter complexity ($O(1)$), where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated outstanding performance.
01	Finding an embedding space for a linear approximation of a nonlinear dynamical system enables efficient system identification and control synthesis. The Koopman operator theory lays the foundation for identifying the nonlinear-to-linear coordinate transformations with data-driven methods. Recently, researchers have proposed to use deep neural networks as a more expressive class of basis functions for calculating the Koopman operators. These approaches, however, assume a fixed dimensional state space; they are therefore not applicable to scenarios with a variable number of objects. In this paper, we propose to learn compositional Koopman operators, using graph neural networks to encode the state into object-centric embeddings and using a block-wise linear transition matrix to regularize the shared structure across objects. The learned dynamics can quickly adapt to new environments of unknown physical parameters and produce control signals to achieve a specified goal. Our experiments on manipulating ropes and controlling soft robots show that the proposed method has better efficiency and generalization ability than existing baselines.
01	Training a classifier over a large number of classes, known as 'extreme classification', has become a topic of major interest with applications in technology, science, and e-commerce. Traditional softmax regression induces a gradient cost proportional to the number of classes C, which often is prohibitively expensive. A popular scalable softmax approximation relies on uniform negative sampling, which suffers from slow convergence due a poor signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a simple training method for drastically enhancing the gradient signal by drawing negative samples from an adversarial model that mimics the data distribution. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) an adversarial sampling mechanism that produces negative samples at a cost only logarithmic in C, thus still resulting in cheap gradient updates; (ii) a mathematical proof that this adversarial sampling minimizes the gradient variance while any bias due to non-uniform sampling can be removed; (iii) experimental results on large scale data sets that show a reduction of the training time by an order of magnitude relative to several competitive baselines.
10	We review eight machine learning classification algorithms to analyze Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in order to distinguish EEG patterns associated with five basic educational tasks. There is a large variety of classifiers being used in this EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) field. While previous EEG experiments used several classifiers in the same experiments or reviewed different algorithms on datasets from different experiments, our approach focuses on review eight classifier categories on the same dataset, including linear classifiers, non-linear Bayesian classifiers, nearest neighbour classifiers, ensemble methods, adaptive classifiers, tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning. Besides, we intend to find an approach which can run smoothly on the current mainstream personal computers and smartphones.  The empirical evaluation demonstrated that Random Forest and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) outperform other approaches. We used a data set which users were conducting five frequently-conduct learning-related tasks, including reading, writing, and typing. Results showed that these best two algorithms could correctly classify different users with an accuracy increase of  5% to 9%, use each task independently. Within each subject, the tasks could be recognized with an accuracy increase of  4% to 7%, compared with other approaches. This work suggests that Random Forest could be a recommended approach (fast and accurate) for current mainstream hardware, while LSTM has the potential to be the first-choice approach when the mainstream computers and smartphones can process more data in a shorter time. 
10	Large-scale benchmark datasets have been among the major driving forces in AI, supporting training of models and measuring their progress. The key assumption is that these benchmarks are realistic approximations of the target tasks in the real world. However, while machine performance on these benchmarks advances rapidly --- often surpassing human performance --- it still struggles on the target tasks in the wild. This raises an important question: whether the surreal high performance on existing benchmarks are inflated due to spurious biases in them, and if so, how we can effectively revise these benchmarks to better simulate more realistic problem distributions in the real world.  In this paper, we posit that while the real world problems consist of a great deal of long-tail problems, existing benchmarks are overly populated with a great deal of similar (thus non-tail) problems, which in turn, leads to a major overestimation of true AI performance. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework of Adversarial Filters to investigate model-based reduction of dataset biases. We discuss that the optimum bias reduction via AFOptimum is intractable, thus propose AFLite, an iterative greedy algorithm that adversarially filters out data points to identify a reduced dataset with more realistic problem distributions and considerably less spurious biases. AFLite is lightweight and can in principle be applied to any task and dataset. We apply it to popular benchmarks that are practically solved --- ImageNet and Natural Language Inference (SNLI, MNLI, QNLI) --- and present filtered counterparts as new challenge datasets where the model performance drops considerably (e.g., from 84% to 24% for ImageNet and from 92% to 62% for SNLI), while human performance remains high. An extensive suite of analysis demonstrates that AFLite effectively reduces measurable dataset biases in both the synthetic and real datasets. Finally, we introduce new measures of dataset biases based on K-nearest-neighbors to help guide future research on dataset developments and bias reduction. 
10	Abstract Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used to optimize deep neural networks, but choosing one usually means making tradeoffs between speed, accuracy and stability. Here we present an intuition for why the tradeoffs exist as well as a method for unifying the two in a continuous way. This makes it possible to control the way models are trained in much greater detail. We show that for default parameters, the new algorithm equals or outperforms SGD and Adam across a range of models for image classification tasks and outperforms SGD for language modeling tasks.
10	While counter machines have received little attention in theoretical computer science since the 1960s, they have recently achieved a newfound relevance to the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recent work has suggested that some strong-performing recurrent neural networks utilize their memory as counters. Thus, one potential way to understand the sucess of these networks is to revisit the theory of counter computation. Therefore, we choose to study the abilities of real-time counter machines as formal grammars. We first show that several variants of the counter machine converge to express the same class of formal languages. We also prove that counter languages are closed under complement, union, intersection, and many other common set operations. Next, we show that counter machines cannot evaluate boolean expressions, even though they can weakly validate their syntax. This has implications for the interpretability and evaluation of neural network systems: successfully matching syntactic patterns does not guarantee that a counter-like model accurately represents underlying semantic structures. Finally, we consider the question of whether counter languages are semilinear. This work makes general contributions to the theory of formal languages that are of particular interest for the interpretability of recurrent neural networks.
10	As deep neural networks become widely adopted for solving most problems in computer vision and audio-understanding, there are rising concerns about their potential vulnerability. In particular, they are very sensitive to adversarial attacks, which manipulate the input to alter models' predictions. Despite large bodies of work to address this issue, the problem remains open.  In this paper, we propose defensive tensorization, a novel adversarial defense technique that leverages a latent high order factorization of the network. Randomization is applied in the latent subspace, therefore resulting in dense reconstructed weights, without the sparsity or perturbations typically induced by the randomization.Our approach can be easily integrated with any arbitrary neural architecture and combined with techniques like adversarial training. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard image classification benchmarks. We further validate the generalizability of our approach across domains and low-precision architectures by considering an audio classification task and binary networks. In all cases, we demonstrate superior performance compared to prior works in the target scenario.
01	The quality of the representations achieved by embeddings is determined by how well the geometry of the embedding space matches the structure of the data.Euclidean space has been the workhorse for embeddings; recently hyperbolic and spherical spaces have gained popularity due to their ability to better embed new types of structured data---such as hierarchical data---but most data is not structured so uniformly.We address this problem by proposing learning embeddings in a product manifold combining multiple copies of these model spaces (spherical, hyperbolic, Euclidean), providing a space of heterogeneous curvature suitable for a wide variety of structures.We introduce a heuristic to estimate the sectional curvature of graph data and directly determine an appropriate signature---the number of component spaces and their dimensions---of the product manifold.Empirically, we jointly learn the curvature and the embedding in the product space via Riemannian optimization.We discuss how to define and compute intrinsic quantities such as means---a challenging notion for product manifolds---and provably learnable optimization functions.On a range of datasets and reconstruction tasks, our product space embeddings outperform single Euclidean or hyperbolic spaces used in previous works, reducing distortion by 32.55% on a Facebook social network dataset. We learn word embeddings and find that a product of hyperbolic spaces in 50 dimensions consistently improves on baseline Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings, by 2.6points in Spearman rank correlation on similarity tasksand 3.4 points on analogy accuracy.
10	"Learning to imitate expert actions given demonstrations containing image observations is a difficult problem in robotic control. The key challenge is generalizing behavior to out-of-distribution states that differ from those in the demonstrations. State-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms perform well in environments with low-dimensional observations, but typically involve adversarial optimization procedures, which can be difficult to use with high-dimensional image observations. We propose a remarkably simple alternative based on off-policy soft Q-learning, which we call soft Q imitation learning (SQIL, pronounced ""skill""), that rewards the agent for matching demonstrated actions in demonstrated states. The key idea is initially filling the agent's experience replay buffer with demonstrations, where rewards are set to a positive constant, and setting rewards to zero in all additional experiences. We derive SQIL from first principles as a method for performing approximate inference under the MaxCausalEnt model of expert behavior. The approximate inference objective trades off between a pure behavioral cloning loss and a regularization term that incorporates information about state transitions via the soft Bellman error. Our experiments show that SQIL matches the state of the art in low-dimensional environments, and significantly outperforms prior work in playing video games from high-dimensional images."
01	Due to insufficient training data and the high computational cost to train a deep neural network from scratch, transfer learning has been extensively used in many deep-neural-network-based applications. A commonly used transfer learning approach involves taking a part of a pre-trained model, adding a few layers at the end, and re-training the new layers with a small dataset. This approach, while efficient and widely used, imposes a security vulnerability because the pre-trained model used in transfer learning is usually publicly available, including to potential attackers. In this paper, we show that without any additional knowledge other than the pre-trained model, an attacker can launch an effective and efficient brute force attack that can craft instances of input to trigger each target class with high confidence. We assume that the attacker has no access to any target-specific information, including samples from target classes, re-trained model, and probabilities assigned by Softmax to each class, and thus making the attack target-agnostic. These assumptions render all previous attack models inapplicable, to the best of our knowledge. To evaluate the proposed attack, we perform a set of experiments on face recognition and speech recognition tasks and show the effectiveness of the attack. Our work reveals a fundamental security weakness of the Softmax layer when used in transfer learning settings.
10	Federated Learning (FL) refers to learning a high quality global model based on decentralized data storage, without ever copying the raw data. A natural scenario arises with data created on mobile phones by the activity of their users. Given the typical data heterogeneity in such situations, it is natural to ask how can the global model be personalized for every such device, individually. In this work, we point out that the setting of Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), where one optimizes for a fast, gradient-based, few-shot adaptation to a heterogeneous distribution of tasks, has a number of similarities with the objective of personalization for FL. We present FL as a natural source of practical applications for MAML algorithms, and make the following observations. 1) The popular FL algorithm, Federated Averaging, can be interpreted as a meta learning algorithm. 2) Careful fine-tuning can yield a global model with higher accuracy, which is at the same time easier to personalize. However, solely optimizing for the global model accuracy yields a weaker personalization result. 3) A model trained using a standard datacenter optimization method is much harder to personalize, compared to one trained using Federated Averaging, supporting the first claim. These results raise new questions for FL, MAML, and broader ML research.
01	Many machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs. So far it was unclear how much risk adversarial perturbations carry for the safety of real-world machine learning applications because most methods used to generate such perturbations rely either on detailed model information (gradient-based attacks) or on confidence scores such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are available in most real-world scenarios. In many such cases one currently needs to retreat to transfer-based attacks which rely on cumbersome substitute models, need access to the training data and can be defended against. Here we emphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model decision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple defences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this category were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce the Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large adversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while staying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no hyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive with the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like ImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com. The Boundary Attack in particular and the class of decision-based attacks in general open new avenues to study the robustness of machine learning models and raise new questions regarding the safety of deployed machine learning systems. An implementation of the attack is available as part of Foolbox (https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox).
01	 As people learn to navigate the world, autonomic nervous system (e.g., ``fight or flight) responses provide intrinsic feedback about the potential consequence of action choices (e.g., becoming nervous when close to a cliff edge or driving fast around a bend.) Physiological changes are correlated with these biological preparations to protect one-self from danger. We present a novel approach to reinforcement learning that leverages a task-independent intrinsic reward function trained on peripheral pulse measurements that are correlated with human autonomic nervous system responses. Our hypothesis is that such reward functions can circumvent the challenges associated with sparse and skewed rewards in reinforcement learning settings and can help improve sample efficiency. We test this in a simulated driving environment and show that it can increase the speed of learning and reduce the number of collisions during the learning stage.
10	Any autoencoder network can be turned into a generative model by imposing an arbitrary prior distribution on its hidden code vector. Variational Autoencoder uses a KL divergence penalty to impose the prior, whereas Adversarial Autoencoder uses generative adversarial networks.  A straightforward modification of Adversarial Autoencoder can be achieved by replacing the adversarial network with maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) network. This replacement leads to a new set of probabilistic autoencoder which is also discussed in our paper.However, an essential challenge remains in both of these probabilistic autoencoders, namely that the only source of randomness at the output of encoder, is the training data itself.  Lack of enough stochasticity can make the optimization problem non-trivial. As a result, they can lead to degenerate solutions where the generator collapses into sampling only a few modes.Our proposal is to replace the adversary of the adversarial autoencoder by a space of {\it stochastic} functions. This replacement introduces a a new source of randomness which can be considered as a continuous control for encouraging {\it explorations}. This prevents the adversary from fitting too closely to the generator and therefore leads to more diverse set of generated samples. Consequently, the decoder serves as a better generative network which unlike MMD nets scales linearly with the amount of data. We provide mathematical and empirical evidence on how this replacement outperforms the pre-existing architectures.   
10	Most deep neural networks (DNNs) require complex models to achieve high performance. Parameter quantization is widely used for reducing the implementation complexities. Previous studies on quantization were mostly based on extensive simulation using training data. We choose a different approach and attempt to measure the per-parameter capacity of DNN models and interpret the results to obtain insights on optimum quantization of parameters. This research uses artificially generated data and generic forms of fully connected DNNs, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. We conduct memorization and classification tests to study the effects of the number and precision of the parameters on the performance. The model and the per-parameter capacities are assessed by measuring the mutual information between the input and the classified output. We also extend the memorization capacity measurement results to image classification and language modeling tasks. To get insight for parameter quantization when performing real tasks, the training and test performances are compared.
01	Although variational autoencoders (VAEs) represent a widely influential deep generative model, many aspects of the underlying energy function remain poorly understood.  In particular, it is commonly believed that Gaussian encoder/decoder assumptions reduce the effectiveness of VAEs in generating realistic samples.  In this regard, we rigorously analyze the VAE objective, differentiating situations where this belief is and is not actually true.  We then leverage the corresponding insights to develop a simple VAE enhancement that requires no additional hyperparameters or sensitive tuning.  Quantitatively, this proposal produces crisp samples and stable FID scores that are actually competitive with a variety of GAN models, all while retaining desirable attributes of the original VAE architecture. The code for our model is available at \url{https://github.com/daib13/TwoStageVAE}.
10	The intensive computation and memory requirements of generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) hinder its real-world deployment on edge devices such as smartphones. Despite the success in model reduction of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), neural network quantization methods have not yet been studied on GANs, which are mainly faced with the issues of both the effectiveness of quantization algorithms and the instability of training GAN models. In this paper, we start with an extensive study on applying existing successful CNN quantization methods to quantize GAN models to extreme low bits. Our observation reveals that none of them generates samples with reasonable quality because of the underrepresentation of quantized weights in models, and the generator and discriminator networks show different sensitivities upon the quantization precision. Motivated by these observations, we develop a novel quantization method for GANs based on EM algorithms, named as QGAN. We also propose a multi-precision algorithm to help find an appropriate quantization precision of GANs given image qualities requirements. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CelebA show that QGAN can quantize weights in GANs to even 1-bit or 2-bit representations with results of quality comparable to original models.
01	The ground-breaking performance obtained by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing tasks is inspiring research efforts attempting to extend it for 3D geometric tasks. One of the main challenge in applying CNNs to 3D shape analysis is how to define a natural convolution operator on non-euclidean surfaces. In this paper, we present a method for applying deep learning to 3D surfaces using their spherical descriptors and alt-az anisotropic convolution on 2-sphere. A cascade set of geodesic disk filters rotate on the 2-sphere and collect spherical patterns and so to extract geometric features for various 3D shape analysis tasks. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that our proposed method has the possibility to bridge the gap between 2D images and 3D shapes with the desired rotation equivariance/invariance, and its effectiveness is evaluated in applications of non-rigid/ rigid shape classification and shape retrieval.
01	Designing RNA molecules has garnered recent interest in medicine, synthetic biology, biotechnology and bioinformatics since many functional RNA molecules were shown to be involved in regulatory processes for transcription, epigenetics and translation. Since an RNA's function depends on its structural properties, the RNA Design problem is to find an RNA sequence which satisfies given structural constraints. Here, we propose a new algorithm for the RNA Design problem, dubbed LEARNA. LEARNA uses deep reinforcement learning to train a policy network to sequentially design an entire RNA sequence given a specified target structure. By meta-learning across 65000 different RNA Design tasks for one hour on 20 CPU cores, our extension Meta-LEARNA constructs an RNA Design policy that can be applied out of the box to solve novel RNA Design tasks. Methodologically, for what we believe to be the first time, we jointly optimize over a rich space of architectures for the policy network, the hyperparameters of the training procedure and the formulation of the decision process. Comprehensive empirical results on two widely-used RNA Design benchmarks, as well as a third one that we introduce, show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the former while also being orders of magnitudes faster in reaching the previous state-of-the-art performance. In an ablation study, we analyze the importance of our method's different components.
01	In model-based reinforcement learning, the agent interleaves between model learning and planning.  These two components are  inextricably intertwined. If the model is not able to provide sensible long-term prediction, the executed planer would exploit model flaws, which can yield catastrophic failures. This paper focuses on building a model that reasons about the long-term future and demonstrates how to use this for efficient planning and exploration. To this end, we build a latent-variable autoregressive model by leveraging recent ideas in variational inference. We argue that forcing latent variables to carry future information through an auxiliary task substantially improves long-term predictions. Moreover, by planning in the latent space, the planner's solution is ensured to be within regions where the model is valid. An exploration strategy can be devised by searching for unlikely trajectories under the model. Our methods achieves higher reward faster compared to baselines on a variety of tasks and environments in both the imitation learning and model-based reinforcement learning settings. 
01	Many machine learning image classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, inputs with perturbations designed to intentionally trigger misclassification. Current adversarial methods directly alter pixel colors and evaluate against pixel norm-balls: pixel perturbations smaller than a specified magnitude, according to a measurement norm. This evaluation, however, has limited practical utility since perturbations in the pixel space do not correspond to underlying real-world phenomena of image formation that lead to them and has no security motivation attached. Pixels in natural images are measurements of light that has interacted with the geometry of a physical scene. As such, we propose a novel evaluation measure, parametric norm-balls, by directly perturbing physical parameters that underly image formation. One enabling contribution we present is a physically-based differentiable renderer that allows us to propagate pixel gradients to the parametric space of lighting and geometry. Our approach enables physically-based adversarial attacks, and our differentiable renderer leverages models from the interactive rendering literature to balance the performance and accuracy trade-offs necessary for a memory-efficient and scalable adversarial data augmentation workflow.
01	Clustering methods and latent variable models are often used as tools for pattern mining and discovery of latent structure in time-series data. In this work, we consider the problem of learning procedural abstractions from possibly high-dimensional observational sequences, such as video demonstrations. Given a dataset of time-series, the goal is to identify the latent sequence of steps common to them and label each time-series with the temporal extent of these procedural steps. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model called Prism that models the realization of a common procedure across multiple time-series, and can recover procedural abstractions with supervision. We also bring to light two characteristics ignored by traditional evaluation criteria when evaluating latent temporal labelings (temporal clusterings) -- segment structure, and repeated structure -- and develop new metrics tailored to their evaluation. We demonstrate that our metrics improve interpretability and ease of analysis for evaluation on benchmark time-series datasets. Results on benchmark and video datasets indicate that Prism outperforms standard sequence models as well as state-of-the-art techniques in identifying procedural abstractions.
01	Prior work on neural network verification has focused on specifications that are linear functions of the output of the network, e.g., invariance of the classifier output under adversarial perturbations of the input. In this paper, we extend verification algorithms to be able to certify richer properties of neural networks. To do this we introduce the class of convex-relaxable specifications, which constitute nonlinear specifications that can be verified using a convex relaxation. We show that a number of important properties of interest can be modeled within this class, including conservation of energy in a learned dynamics model of a physical system; semantic consistency of a classifier's output labels under adversarial perturbations and bounding errors in a system that predicts the summation of handwritten digits. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method is able to effectively verify these specifications. Moreover, our evaluation exposes the failure modes in models which cannot be verified to satisfy these specifications. Thus, emphasizing the importance of training models not just to fit training data but also to be consistent with specifications.
10	We present a systematic framework for the Nesterov's accelerated gradient flows in the spaces of probabilities embedded with information metrics. Here two metrics are considered, including both the Fisher-Rao metric and the Wasserstein-$2$ metric. For the Wasserstein-$2$ metric case, we prove the convergence properties of the accelerated gradient flows, and introduce their formulations in Gaussian families. Furthermore, we propose a practical discrete-time algorithm in particle implementations with an adaptive restart technique.  We formulate a novel bandwidth selection method, which learns the Wasserstein-$2$ gradient direction from Brownian-motion samples. Experimental results including Bayesian inference show the strength of the current method compared with the state-of-the-art.
10	We show that Bayes' rule provides a compelling mechanism for controlling unconditional document language models, using the long-standing challenge of effectively leveraging document context in machine translation. In our formulation, we estimate the probability of a candidate translation as the product of the unconditional probability of the candidate output document and the ``reverse translation probability'' of translating the candidate output back into the input source language document---the so-called ``noisy channel'' decomposition. A particular advantage of our model is that it requires only parallel sentences to train, rather than parallel documents, which are not always available. Using a new beam search reranking approximation to solve the decoding problem, we find that document language models outperform language models that assume independence between sentences, and that using either a document or sentence language model outperform comparable models that directly estimate the translation probability. We obtain the best-published results on the NIST Chinese--English translation task, a standard task for evaluating document translation. Our model also outperforms the benchmark Transformer model by approximately 2.5 BLEU on the WMT19 Chinese--English translation task.
10	The current approaches for machine translation usually require large set of parallel corpus in order to achieve fluency like in the case of neural machine translation (NMT), statistical machine translation (SMT) and example-based machine translation (EBMT). The context awareness of phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) approaches is also questionable. This research develops a system that translates English text to Amharic text using a combination of context based machine translation (CBMT) and a recurrent neural network machine translation (RNNMT). We built a bilingual dictionary for the CBMT system to use along with a large target corpus. The RNNMT model has then been provided with the output of the CBMT and a parallel corpus for training. Our combinational approach on English-Amharic language pair yields a performance improvement over the simple neural machine translation (NMT).
10	Despite significant advances in the field of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), today's algorithms still fail to learn human-level policies consistently over a set of diverse tasks such as Atari 2600 games. We identify three key challenges that any algorithm needs to master in order to perform well on all games:  processing diverse reward distributions, reasoning over long time horizons, and exploring efficiently.  In this paper, we propose an algorithm that addresses each of these challenges and is able to learn human-level policies on nearly all Atari games. A new transformed Bellman operator allows our algorithm to process rewards of varying densities and scales; an auxiliary temporal consistency loss allows us to train stably using a discount factor of 0.999 (instead of 0.99) extending the effective planning horizon by an order of magnitude; and we ease the exploration problem by using human demonstrations that guide the agent towards rewarding states. When tested on a set of 42 Atari games, our algorithm exceeds the performance  of an average human on 40 games using a common set of hyper parameters.
10	Energy  based  models  outputs  unmormalized  log-probability  values  given  datasamples.  Such a estimation is essential in a variety of application problems suchas sample generation, denoising, sample restoration, outlier detection, Bayesianreasoning, and many more.  However, standard maximum likelihood training iscomputationally expensive due to the requirement of sampling model distribution.Score matching potentially alleviates this problem, and denoising score matching(Vincent, 2011) is a particular convenient version.  However,  previous attemptsfailed to produce models capable of high quality sample synthesis.  We believethat  it  is  because  they  only  performed  denoising  score  matching  over  a  singlenoise scale. To overcome this limitation, here we instead learn an energy functionusing all noise scales.   When sampled using Annealed Langevin dynamics andsingle step denoising jump, our model produced high-quality samples comparableto state-of-the-art techniques such as GANs, in addition to assigning likelihood totest data comparable to previous likelihood models.  Our model set a new sam-ple quality baseline in likelihood-based models.  We further demonstrate that our model learns sample distribution and generalize well on an image inpainting tasks.
10	This paper presents an unbiased exploration framework for the belief state $p(s)$ in non-cooperative, multi-agent, partially-observable environments through differentiable recurrent functions. As well as single-agent exploration via intrinsic reward and generative RNNs, several researchers have proposed differentiable multi-agent communication models such as CommNet and IC3Net for scalable exploration through multiple agents. However, none of the existing frameworks so far capture the unbiased belief state in non-cooperative settings as with the nature due to  biased examples reported from adersarial agents.{\em Generative integration networks} (GINs) is the first unbiased exploration framework insipired by honest reporting mechanisms in economics. The key idea is {\em synchrony}, an inter-agent reward to discriminate the honest reporting and the adversarial reporting \textbf{without real examples}, which is the different point from the GANs. Experimental results obtained using two non-cooperative multi-agent environments up to 20 agents denote that GINs show state-of-the-art performance in the exploration frameworks.
10	We present an approach for anytime predictions in deep neural networks (DNNs). For each test sample, an anytime predictor produces a coarse result quickly, and then continues to refine it until the test-time computational budget is depleted. Such predictors can address the growing computational problem of DNNs by automatically adjusting to varying test-time budgets. In this work, we study a \emph{general} augmentation to feed-forward networks to form anytime neural networks (ANNs) via auxiliary predictions and losses. Specifically, we point out a blind-spot in recent studies in such ANNs: the importance of high final accuracy. In fact, we show on multiple recognition data-sets and architectures that by having near-optimal final predictions in small anytime models, we can effectively double the speed of large ones to reach corresponding accuracy level. We achieve such speed-up with simple weighting of anytime losses that oscillate during training. We also assemble a sequence of exponentially deepening ANNs, to achieve both theoretically and practically near-optimal anytime results at any budget, at the cost of a constant fraction of additional consumed budget.
10	The recent success of generative adversarial networks and variational learning suggests training a classifier network may work well in addressing the classical two-sample problem. Network-based tests have the computational advantage that the algorithm scales to large samples. This paper proposes to use the difference of the logit of a trained neural network classifier evaluated on the two finite samples as the test statistic. Theoretically, we prove the testing power to differentiate two smooth densities given that the network is sufficiently parametrized, by comparing the learned logit function to the log ratio of the densities, the latter maximizing the population training objective. When the two densities lie on or near to low-dimensional manifolds embedded in possibly high-dimensional space, the needed network complexity is reduced to only depending on the intrinsic manifold geometry. In experiments, the method demonstrates better performance than previous network-based tests which use the classification accuracy as the test statistic, and compares favorably to certain kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) tests on synthetic and hand-written digits datasets.
10	We present an unsupervised method for learning speech representations based on a bidirectional contrastive predictive coding that implicitly discovers phonetic structure from large-scale corpora of unlabelled raw audio signals. The representations, which we learn from up to 8000 hours of publicly accessible speech data, are evaluated by looking at their impact on the behaviour of supervised speech recognition systems. First, across a variety of datasets, we find that the features learned from the largest and most diverse pretraining dataset result in significant improvements over standard audio features as well as over features learned from smaller amounts of pretraining data. Second, they significantly improve sample efficiency in low-data scenarios. Finally, the features confer significant robustness advantages to the resulting recognition systems: we see significant improvements in out-of-domain transfer relative to baseline feature sets, and the features likewise provide improvements in four different low-resource African language datasets.
10	We introduce and demonstrate the variational autoencoder (VAE) for probabilistic non-negative matrix factorisation (PAE-NMF). We design a network which can perform non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) and add in aspects of a VAE to make the coefficients of the latent space probabilistic. By restricting the weights in the final layer of the network to be non-negative and using the non-negative Weibull distribution we produce a probabilistic form of NMF which allows us to generate new data and find a probability distribution that effectively links the latent and input variables. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PAE-NMF on three heterogeneous datasets: images, financial time series and genomic.
10	"Adversarial examples are malicious inputs crafted to cause a model to misclassify them. In their most common instantiation, ""perturbation-based"" adversarial examples introduce  changes to the input that leave its true label unchanged, yet result in a different model prediction.  Conversely, ""invariance-based"" adversarial examples insert changes to the input that leave the model's prediction unaffected despite the underlying input's label having changed. So far, the relationship between these two notions of adversarial examples has not been studied, we close this gap.We demonstrate that solely achieving perturbation-based robustness is insufficient for complete adversarial robustness. Worse, we find that classifiers trained to be Lp-norm robust are more vulnerable to invariance-based adversarial examples than their undefended counterparts. We construct theoretical arguments and analytical examples to justify why this is the case. We then illustrate empirically that the consequences of excessive perturbation-robustness can be exploited to craft new attacks. Finally, we show how to attack a provably robust defense --- certified on the MNIST test set to have at least 87% accuracy (with respect to the original test labels) under perturbations of Linfinity-norm below epsilon=0.4 --- and reduce its accuracy (under this threat model with respect to an ensemble of human labelers) to 60% with an automated attack, or just 12% with human-crafted adversarial examples."
01	Class-conditional generative models hold promise to overcome the shortcomings of their discriminative counterparts. They are a natural choice to solve discriminative tasks in a robust manner as they jointly optimize for predictive performance and accurate modeling of the input distribution. In this work, we investigate robust classification with likelihood-based generative models from a theoretical and practical perspective to investigate if they can deliver on their promises. Our analysis focuses on a spectrum of robustness properties: (1) Detection of worst-case outliers in the form of adversarial examples; (2) Detection of average-case outliers in the form of ambiguous inputs and (3) Detection of incorrectly labeled in-distribution inputs. Our theoretical result reveals that it is impossible to guarantee detectability of adversarially-perturbed inputs even for near-optimal generative classifiers. Experimentally, we find that while we are able to train robust models for MNIST, robustness completely breaks down on CIFAR10. We relate this failure to various undesirable model properties that can be traced to the maximum likelihood training objective. Despite being a common choice in the literature, our results indicate that likelihood-based conditional generative models may are surprisingly ineffective for robust classification.
10	We improve previous end-to-end differentiable neural networks (NNs) with fastweight memories. A gate mechanism updates fast weights at every time step ofa sequence through two separate outer-product-based matrices generated by slowparts of the net. The system is trained on a complex sequence to sequence variationof the Associative Retrieval Problem with roughly 70 times more temporalmemory (i.e. time-varying variables) than similar-sized standard recurrent NNs(RNNs). In terms of accuracy and number of parameters, our architecture outperformsa variety of RNNs, including Long Short-Term Memory, Hypernetworks,and related fast weight architectures.
10	Recent work on adversarial attack and defense suggests that projected gradient descent (PGD) is a universal $l_\infty$ first-order attack, and PGD adversarial training can significantly improve network robustness against a wide range of first-order $l_\infty$-bounded attacks, represented as the state-of-the-art defense method. However, an obvious weakness of PGD adversarial training is its highly-computational cost in generating adversarial samples, making it computationally infeasible for large and high-resolution real datasets such as the ImageNet dataset. In addition, recent work also has suggested a simple ``close-form'' solution to a robust model on MNIST. Therefore, a natural question raised is that is PGD adversarial training really necessary for robust defense? In this paper, surprisingly, we give a negative answer by proposing a training paradigm that is comparable to PGD adversarial training on several standard datasets, while only using noisy-natural samples. Specifically, we reformulate the min-max objective in PGD adversarial training by a minimization problem to minimize the original network loss plus $l_1$ norms of its gradients evaluated on the inputs (including adversarial samples). The original loss can be solved by natural training; for the $l_1$-norm loss, we propose a computationally-feasible solution by embedding a differentiable soft-quantization layer after the input layer of a network. We show formally that the soft-quantization layer trained with noisy-natural samples is an alternative approach to minimizing the $l_1$-gradient norms as in PGD adversarial training. Extensive empirical evaluations on three standard datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that our proposed models are comparable to PGD-adversarially-trained models under PGD and BPDA attacks using both cross-entropy and $CW_\infty$ losses. Remarkably, our method achieves a 24X speed-up on MNIST while maintaining a comparable defensive ability, and for the first time fine-tunes a robust Imagenet model within only two days. Code for the experiments will be released on Github.
01	We present a modern scalable reinforcement learning agent called SEED (Scalable, Efficient Deep-RL). By effectively utilizing modern accelerators, we show that it is not only possible to train on millions of frames per second but also to lower the cost. of experiments compared to current methods. We achieve this with a simple architecture that features centralized inference and an optimized communication layer. SEED adopts two state-of-the-art distributed algorithms, IMPALA/V-trace (policy gradients) and R2D2 (Q-learning), and is evaluated on Atari-57, DeepMind Lab and Google Research Football. We improve the state of the art on Football and are able to reach state of the art on Atari-57 twice as fast in wall-time. For the scenarios we consider, a 40% to 80% cost reduction for running experiments is achieved. The implementation along with experiments is open-sourced so results can be reproduced and novel ideas tried out.
10	Learning disentangled representations of  data is one of the central themes in unsupervised learning in general and generative modelling in particular.  In this work,  we tackle a slightly more intricate scenario where the observations are generated from a conditional distribution of some known control variate and some latent noise variate.  To this end, we present a hierarchical model and a training method (CZ-GEM) that leverages some of the recent developments in likelihood-based and likelihood-free generative models.  We show that by formulation, CZ-GEM introduces the right inductive biases that ensure the disentanglement of the control from the noise variables, while also keeping the components of the control variate disentangled. This is achieved without compromising on the quality of the generated samples. Our approach is simple, general, and can be applied both in supervised and unsupervised settings.
10	Understanding and improving Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) using notions from Optimal Transport (OT) theory has been a successful area of study, originally established by the introduction of the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). An increasing number of GANs incorporate OT for improving their discriminators, but that is so far the sole way for the two domains to cross-fertilize. In this work we address the converse question: is it possible to recover an optimal map in a GAN fashion? To achieve this, we build a new model relying on the second Wasserstein distance. This choice enables the use of many results from OT community. In particular, we may completely describe the dynamics of the generator during training. In addition, experiments show that practical uses of our model abide by the rule of evolution we describe. As an application, our generator may be considered as a new way of computing an optimal transport map. It is competitive in low-dimension with standard and deterministic ways to approach the same problem. In high dimension, the fact it is a GAN-style method makes it more powerful than other methods.
10	Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is widely used for multimodal data analysis and, more recently, for discriminative tasks such as multi-view learning; however, it makes no use of class labels.  Recent CCA methods have started to address this weakness but are limited in that they do not simultaneously optimize the CCA projection for discrimination and the CCA projection itself, or they are linear only. We address these deficiencies by simultaneously optimizing a CCA-based and a task objective in an end-to-end manner. Together, these two objectives learn a non-linear CCA projection to a shared latent space that is highly correlated and discriminative. Our method shows a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art (including deep supervised approaches) for cross-view classification (8.5% increase), regularization with a second view during training when only one view is available at test time (2.2-3.2%), and semi-supervised learning (15%) on real data.
10	In this paper we propose to view the acceptance rate of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a universal objective for learning to sample from target distribution -- given either as a set of samples or in the form of unnormalized density. This point of view unifies the goals of such approaches as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), variational inference. To reveal the connection we derive the lower bound on the acceptance rate and treat it as the objective for learning explicit and implicit samplers. The form of the lower bound allows for doubly stochastic gradient optimization in case the target distribution factorizes (i.e. over data points). We empirically validate our approach on Bayesian inference for neural networks and generative models for images.
10	 Global feature pooling is a modern variant of feature pooling providing better interpretatability and regularization. Although alternative pooling methods exist (eg. max, lp norm, stochastic), the averaging operation is still the dominating global pooling scheme in popular models. As fine-grained recognition requires learning subtle, discriminative features, we consider the question: is average pooling the optimal strategy? We first ask: ``is there a difference between features learned by global average and max pooling?'' Visualization and quantitative analysis show that max pooling encourages learning features of different spatial scales. We then ask ``is there a single global feature pooling variant that's most suitable for fine-grained recognition?'' A thorough evaluation of nine representative pooling algorithms finds that: max pooling outperforms average pooling consistently across models, datasets, and image resolutions; it does so by reducing the generalization gap; and generalized pooling's performance increases almost monotonically as it changes from average to max. We finally ask: ``what's the best way to combine two heterogeneous pooling schemes?'' Common strategies struggle because of potential gradient conflict but the ``freeze-and-train'' trick works best. We also find that post-global batch normalization helps with faster convergence and improves model performance consistently.
10	Transfer learning has proven to be a successful way to train high performing deep learning models in various applications for which little labeled data is available. In transfer learning, one pre-trains the model on a large dataset such as Imagenet or MS-COCO, and fine-tunes its weights on the target domain. In our work, we claim that in the new era of ever increasing number of massive datasets, selecting the relevant pre-training data itself is a critical issue. We introduce a new problem in which available datasets are stored in one centralized location, i.e., a dataserver. We assume that a client, a target application with its own small labeled dataset, is only interested in fetching a subset of the server’s data that is most relevant to its own target domain. We propose a novel method that aims to optimally select subsets of data from the dataserver given a particular target client. We perform data selection by employing a mixture of experts model in a series of dataserver- client transactions with a small computational cost. We show the effectiveness of our work in several transfer learning scenarios, demonstrating state-of-the-art per- formance on several target datasets and tasks such as image classification, object detection and instance segmentation. We will make our framework available as a web-service, serving data to users trying to improve performance in their A.I. application.
10	Recently, many stochastic gradient descent algorithms with variance reduction have been proposed. Moreover, their proximal variants such as Prox-SVRG can effectively solve non-smooth problems, which makes that they are widely applied in many machine learning problems. However, the introduction of proximal operator will result in the error of the optimal value. In order to address this issue, we introduce the idea of extragradient and propose a novel accelerated variance reduced stochastic extragradient descent (AVR-SExtraGD) algorithm, which inherits the advantages of Prox-SVRG and momentum acceleration techniques. Moreover, our  theoretical analysis shows that AVR-SExtraGD enjoys the best-known convergence rates and oracle complexities of stochastic first-order algorithms such as Katyusha for both strongly convex and non-strongly convex problems. Finally, our experimental results show that for ERM problems and robust face recognition via sparse representation, our AVR-SExtraGD can yield the improved performance compared with Prox-SVRG and Katyusha. The asynchronous variant of AVR-SExtraGD outperforms KroMagnon and ASAGA, which are the asynchronous variants of SVRG and SAGA, respectively.
01	We present a meta-learning approach for adaptive text-to-speech (TTS) with few data. During training, we learn a multi-speaker model using a shared conditional WaveNet core and independent learned embeddings for each speaker. The aim of training is not to produce a neural network with fixed weights, which is then deployed as a TTS system. Instead, the aim is to produce a network that requires few data at deployment time to rapidly adapt to new speakers. We introduce and benchmark three strategies:(i) learning the speaker embedding while keeping the WaveNet core fixed,(ii) fine-tuning the entire architecture with stochastic gradient descent, and(iii) predicting the speaker embedding with a trained neural network encoder.The experiments show that these approaches are successful at adapting the multi-speaker neural network to new speakers, obtaining state-of-the-art results in both sample naturalness and voice similarity with merely a few minutes of audio data from new speakers.
10	"Feature attribution methods identify ""relevant"" features as an explanation of a complex machine learning model. Several feature attribution methods have been proposed; however, only a few studies have attempted to define the ""relevance"" of each feature mathematically. In this study, we formalize the feature attribution problem as a feature selection problem. In our proposed formalization, there arise two possible definitions of relevance. We name the feature attribution problems based on these two relevances as Exclusive Feature Selection (EFS) and Inclusive Feature Selection (IFS). We show that several existing feature attribution methods can be interpreted as approximation algorithms for EFS and IFS. Moreover, through exhaustive experiments, we show that IFS is better suited as the formalization for the feature attribution problem than EFS."
10	We introduce a neural network that represents sentences by composing their words according to induced binary parse trees. We use Tree-LSTM as our composition function, applied along a tree structure found by a fully differentiable natural language chart parser. Our model simultaneously optimises both the composition function and the parser, thus eliminating the need for externally-provided parse trees which are normally required for Tree-LSTM. It can therefore be seen as a tree-based RNN that is unsupervised with respect to the parse trees. As it is fully differentiable, our model is easily trained with an off-the-shelf gradient descent method and backpropagation. We demonstrate that it achieves better performance compared to various supervised Tree-LSTM architectures on a textual entailment task and a reverse dictionary task. Finally, we show how performance can be improved with an attention mechanism which fully exploits the parse chart, by attending over all possible subspans of the sentence.
10	Generative image models have made significant progress in the last few years, and are now able to generate low-resolution images which sometimes look realistic. However the state-of-the-art models utilize fully entangled latent representations where small changes to a single neuron can effect every output pixel in relatively arbitrary ways, and different neurons have possibly arbitrary relationships with each other. This limits the ability of such models to generalize to new combinations or orientations of objects as well as their ability to connect with more structured representations such as natural language, without explicit strong supervision. In this work explore the synergistic effect of using partial natural language scene descriptions to help disentangle the latent entities visible an image. We present a novel neural network architecture called Generative Entity Networks, which jointly generates both the natural language descriptions and the images from a set of latent entities. Our model is based on the variational autoencoder framework and makes use of visual attention to identify and characterise the visual attributes of each entity. Using the Shapeworld dataset, we show that our representation both enables a better generative model of images, leading to higher quality image samples, as well as creating more semantically useful representations that improve performance over purely dicriminative models on a simple natural language yes/no question answering task.
10	We propose learning to transfer learn (L2TL) to improve transfer learning on a target dataset by judicious extraction of information from a source dataset. L2TL considers joint optimization of vastly-shared weights between models for source and target tasks, and employs adaptive weights for scaling of constituent losses. The adaptation of the weights is based on reinforcement learning, guided with a performance metric on the target validation set. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of L2TL given fixed models, consistently outperforming fine-tuning baselines on various datasets. In the regimes of small-scale target datasets and significant label mismatch between source and target datasets, L2TL outperforms previous work by an even larger margin. 
10	The estimation of advantage is crucial for a number of reinforcement learning algorithms, as it directly influences the choices of future paths. In this work, we propose a family of estimates based on the order statistics over the path ensemble, which allows one to flexibly drive the learning process in a promotion focus or prevention focus. On top of this formulation, we systematically study the impacts of different regulatory focuses. Our findings reveal that regulatory focus, when chosen appropriately, can result in significant benefits. In particular, for the environments with sparse rewards, promotion focus would lead to more efficient exploration of the policy space; while for those where individual actions can have critical impacts, prevention focus is preferable. On various benchmarks, including MuJoCo continuous control, Terrain locomotion, Atari games, and sparse-reward environments, the proposed schemes consistently demonstrate improvement over mainstream methods, not only accelerating the learning process but also obtaining substantial performance gains.
01	This paper presents a novel two-step approach for the fundamental problem of learning an optimal map from one distribution to another. First, we learn an optimal transport (OT) plan, which can be thought as a one-to-many map between the two distributions. To that end, we propose a stochastic dual approach of regularized OT, and show empirically that it scales better than a recent related approach when the amount of samples is very large. Second, we estimate a Monge map as a deep neural network learned by approximating the barycentric projection of the previously-obtained OT plan. This parameterization allows generalization of the mapping outside the support of the input measure. We prove two theoretical stability results of regularized OT which show that our estimations converge to the OT and Monge map between the underlying continuous measures. We showcase our proposed approach on two applications: domain adaptation and generative modeling.
10	The recent expansion of machine learning applications to molecular biology proved to have a significant contribution to our understanding of biological systems, and genome functioning in particular. Technological advances enabled the collection of large epigenetic datasets, including information about various DNA binding factors (ChIP-Seq) and DNA spatial structure (Hi-C). Several studies have confirmed the correlation between DNA binding factors and Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) in DNA structure. However, the information about physical proximity represented by genomic coordinate was not yet used for the improvement of the prediction models.In this research, we focus on Machine Learning methods for prediction of folding patterns of DNA in a classical model organism Drosophila melanogaster. The paper considers linear models with four types of regularization, Gradient Boosting and Recurrent Neural Networks for the prediction of chromatin folding patterns from epigenetic marks. The bidirectional LSTM RNN model outperformed all the models and gained the best prediction scores. This demonstrates the utilization of complex models and the importance of memory of sequential DNA states for the chromatin folding. We identify informative epigenetic features that lead to the further conclusion of their biological significance.
10	Noise injection is a fundamental tool for data augmentation, and yet there is no widely accepted procedure to incorporate it with learning frameworks. This study analyzes the effects of adding or applying different noise models of varying magnitudes to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. Noise models that are distributed with different density functions are given common magnitude levels via Structural Similarity (SSIM) metric in order to create an appropriate ground for comparison. The basic results are conforming with the most of the common notions in machine learning, and also introduces some novel heuristics and recommendations on noise injection. The new approaches will provide better understanding on optimal learning procedures for image classification.
01	The contrastive divergence algorithm is a popular approach to training energy-based latent variable models, which has been widely used in many machine learning models such as the restricted Boltzmann machines and deep belief nets. Despite its empirical success, the contrastive divergence algorithm is also known to have biases that severely affect its convergence. In this article we propose an unbiased version of the contrastive divergence algorithm that completely removes its bias in stochastic gradient methods, based on recent advances on unbiased Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Rigorous theoretical analysis is developed to justify the proposed algorithm, and numerical experiments show that it significantly improves the existing method. Our findings suggest that the unbiased contrastive divergence algorithm is a promising approach to training general energy-based latent variable models.
10	Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) is able to accelerate the acquisition of new tasks by learning from past experience. Current meta-RL methods usually learn to adapt to new tasks by directly optimizing the parameters of policies over primitive actions. However, for complex tasks which requires sophisticated control strategies, it would be quite inefficient to to directly learn such a meta-policy. Moreover, this problem can become more severe and even fail in spare reward settings, which is quite common in practice. To this end, we propose a new meta-RL algorithm called meta goal-generation for hierarchical RL (MGHRL) by leveraging hierarchical actor-critic framework. Instead of directly generate policies over primitive actions for new tasks, MGHRL learns to generate high-level meta strategies over subgoals given past experience and leaves the rest of how to achieve subgoals as independent RL subtasks. Our empirical results on several challenging simulated robotics environments show that our method enables more efficient and effective meta-learning from past experience and outperforms state-of-the-art meta-RL and Hierarchical-RL methods in sparse reward settings.
10	Ranking is a central task in machine learning and information retrieval. In this task, it is especially important to present the user with a slate of items that is appealing as a whole. This in turn requires taking into account interactions between items, since intuitively, placing an item on the slate affects the decision of which other items should be chosen alongside it.In this work, we propose a sequence-to-sequence model for ranking called seq2slate. At each step, the model predicts the next item to place on the slate given the items already chosen. The recurrent nature of the model allows complex dependencies between items to be captured directly in a flexible and scalable way. We show how to learn the model end-to-end from weak supervision in the form of easily obtained click-through data. We further demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in experiments on standard ranking benchmarks as well as in a real-world recommendation system.
10	Neural models achieved considerable improvement for many natural language processing tasks, but they offer little transparency, and interpretability comes at a cost. In some domains, automated predictions without justifications have limited applicability. Recently, progress has been made regarding single-aspect sentiment analysis for reviews, where the ambiguity of a justification is minimal. In this context, a justification, or mask, consists of (long) word sequences from the input text, which suffice to make the prediction. Existing models cannot handle more than one aspect in one training and induce binary masks that might be ambiguous. In our work, we propose a neural model for predicting multi-aspect sentiments for reviews and generates a probabilistic multi-dimensional mask (one per aspect) simultaneously, in an unsupervised and multi-task learning manner. Our evaluation shows that on three datasets, in the beer and hotel domain, our model outperforms strong baselines and generates masks that are: strong feature predictors, meaningful, and interpretable.
10	Granger causal structure reconstruction is an emerging topic that can uncover causal relationship behind multivariate time series data. In many real-world systems, it is common to encounter a large amount of multivariate time series data collected from heterogeneous individuals with sharing commonalities, however there are ongoing concerns regarding its applicability in such large scale complex scenarios, presenting both challenges and opportunities for Granger causal reconstruction. To bridge this gap,  we propose a Granger cAusal StructurE Reconstruction (GASER) framework for inductive Granger causality learning and common causal structure detection on heterogeneous multivariate time series. In particular, we address the problem through a novel attention mechanism, called prototypical Granger causal attention. Extensive experiments, as well as an online A/B test on an E-commercial advertising platform, demonstrate the superior performances of GASER.
10	We reconsider the training objective of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) from the mixed Nash Equilibria (NE) perspective. Inspired by the classical prox methods, we develop a novel algorithmic framework for GANs via an infinite-dimensional two-player game and prove rigorous convergence rates to the mixed NE. We then propose a principled procedure to reduce our novel prox methods to simple sampling routines, leading to practically efficient algorithms. Finally, we provide experimental evidence that our approach outperforms methods that seek pure strategy equilibria, such as SGD, Adam, and RMSProp, both in speed and quality.
01	Understanding three-dimensional (3D) geometries from two-dimensional (2D) images without any labeled information is promising for understanding the real world without incurring annotation cost. We herein propose a novel generative model, RGBD-GAN, which achieves unsupervised 3D representation learning from 2D images. The proposed method enables camera parameter--conditional image generation and depth image generation without any 3D annotations, such as camera poses or depth. We use an explicit 3D consistency loss for two RGBD images generated from different camera parameters, in addition to the ordinal GAN objective. The loss is simple yet effective for any type of image generator such as DCGAN and StyleGAN to be conditioned on camera parameters. Through experiments, we demonstrated that the proposed method could learn 3D representations from 2D images with various generator architectures.
01	By injecting adversarial examples into training data, adversarial training is promising for improving the robustness of deep learning models. However, most existing adversarial training approaches are based on a specific type of adversarial attack. It may not provide sufficiently representative samples from the adversarial domain, leading to a weak generalization ability on adversarial examples from other attacks. Moreover, during the adversarial training, adversarial perturbations on inputs are usually crafted by fast single-step adversaries so as to scale to large datasets. This work is mainly focused on the adversarial training yet efficient FGSM adversary. In this scenario, it is difficult to train a model with great generalization due to the lack of representative adversarial samples, aka the samples are unable to accurately reflect the adversarial domain. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Adversarial Training with Domain Adaptation (ATDA) method. Our intuition is to regard the adversarial training on FGSM adversary as a domain adaption task with limited number of target domain samples. The main idea is to learn a representation that is semantically meaningful and domain invariant on the clean domain as well as the adversarial domain. Empirical evaluations on Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ATDA can greatly improve the generalization of adversarial training and the smoothness of the learned models, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets. To show the transfer ability of our method, we also extend ATDA to the adversarial training on iterative attacks such as PGD-Adversial Training (PAT) and the defense performance is improved considerably.
10	Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most powerful sequence models. Despite the strong performance, however, it lacks the nice interpretability as in state space models. In this paper, we present a way to combine the best of both worlds by introducing State Space LSTM (SSL), which generalizes the earlier work \cite{zaheer2017latent} of combining topic models with LSTM. However, unlike \cite{zaheer2017latent}, we do not make any factorization assumptions in our inference algorithm. We present an efficient sampler based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method that draws from the joint posterior directly. Experimental results confirms the superiority and stability of this SMC inference algorithm on a variety of domains.
10	Recurrent auto-encoder model can summarise sequential data through an encoder structure into a fixed-length vector and then reconstruct into its original sequential form through the decoder structure. The summarised information can be used to represent time series features. In this paper, we propose relaxing the dimensionality of the decoder output so that it performs partial reconstruction. The fixed-length vector can therefore represent features only in the selected dimensions. In addition, we propose using rolling fixed window approach to generate samples. The change of time series features over time can be summarised as a smooth trajectory path. The fixed-length vectors are further analysed through additional visualisation and unsupervised clustering techniques. This proposed method can be applied in large-scale industrial processes for sensors signal analysis purpose where clusters of the vector representations can be used to reflect the operating states of selected aspects of the industrial system.
10	As the size and complexity of models and datasets grow, so does the need for communication-efficient variants of stochastic gradient descent that can be deployed on clusters to perform model fitting in parallel. Alistarh et al. (2017) describe two variants of data-parallel SGD that quantize and encode gradients to lessen communication costs. For the first variant, QSGD, they provide strong theoretical guarantees. For the second variant, which we call QSGDinf, they demonstrate impressive empirical gains for distributed training of large neural networks. Building on their work, we propose an alternative scheme for quantizing gradients and show that it yields stronger theoretical guarantees than exist for QSGD while matching the empirical performance of QSGDinf.
10	Understanding object motion is one of the core problems in computer vision. It requires segmenting and tracking objects over time. Significant progress has been made in instance segmentation, but such models cannot track objects, and more crucially, they are unable to reason in both 3D space and time.We propose a new spatio-temporal embedding loss on videos that generates temporally consistent video instance segmentation. Our model includes a temporal network that learns to model temporal context and motion, which is essential to produce smooth embeddings over time. Further, our model also estimates monocular depth, with a self-supervised loss, as the relative distance to an object effectively constrains where it can be next, ensuring a time-consistent embedding. Finally, we show that our model can accurately track and segment instances, even with occlusions and missed detections, advancing the state-of-the-art on the KITTI Multi-Object and Tracking Dataset.
01	To act and plan in complex environments, we posit that agents should have a mental simulator of the world with three characteristics: (a) it should build an abstract state representing the condition of the world; (b) it should form a belief which represents uncertainty on the world; (c) it should go beyond simple step-by-step simulation, and exhibit temporal abstraction. Motivated by the absence of a model satisfying all these requirements, we propose TD-VAE, a generative sequence model that learns representations containing explicit beliefs about states several steps into the future, and that can be rolled out directly without single-step transitions. TD-VAE is trained on pairs of temporally separated time points, using an analogue of temporal difference learning used in reinforcement learning.
10	An algorithm is introduced for learning a predictive state representation with off-policy temporal difference (TD) learning that is then used to learn to steer a vehicle with reinforcement learning.  There are three components being learned simultaneously:  (1) the off-policy predictions as a compact representation of state, (2) the behavior policy distribution for estimating the off-policy predictions, and (3) the deterministic policy gradient for learning to act.  A behavior policy discriminator is learned and used for estimating the important sampling ratios needed to learn the predictive representation off-policy with general value functions (GVFs).  A linear deterministic policy gradient method is used to train the agent with only the predictive representations while the predictions are being learned.  All three components are combined, demonstrated and evaluated on the problem of steering the vehicle from images in the TORCS racing simulator environment.Steering from only images is a challenging problem where evaluation is completed on a held-out set of tracks that were never seen during training in order to measure the generalization of the predictions and controller.  Experiments show the proposed method is able to steer smoothly and navigate many but not all of the tracks available in TORCS with performance that exceeds DDPG using only images as input and approaches the performance of an ideal non-vision based kinematics model.
10	Natural language uses words in an associative way to construct sentences: it is not words in isolation, but the appropriate use of hierarchical structures that makes communication successful. We propose a deep learning framework for explicitly tying together the representations between single words and full sentences, resulting in a fluid transfer of knowledge between these two levels of granularity. We construct a multi-head attention mechanism for sentence classification, where the individual attention heads simultaneously learn to perform multi-class sequence labeling. Supervision on individual tokens explicitly teaches the classifier which areas it needs to focus on in each sentence, while the sentence-level objective regularizes the token-level predictions and even enables sequence labeling without token-level training data. Our experiments show that the proposed architecture systematically outperforms its single-task counterparts and exhibits strong transfer capabilities, while also achieving reasonable performance as a zero-shot sequence labeler.
10	In this work we developed a new representation of the chemical information for the machine learning models, with benefits from both the real space (R-space) and energy space (K-space). Different from the previous symmetric matrix presentations, the charge transfer channel based on Pauling’s electronegativity is derived from the dependence on real space distance and orbitals for the hetero atomic structures.  This representation can work for the bulk materials as well as the low dimensional nano materials, and can map the R-space and K-space into the pixel space (P-space) by training and testing 130k structures. P-space can well reproduce the R-space quantities within error 0.53. This new asymmetric matrix representation double the information storage than the previous symmetric representations.This work provides a new dimension for the computational chemistry towards the machine learning architecture. 
10	Chinese text classification has received more and more attention today. However, the problem of Chinese text representation still hinders the improvement of Chinese text classification, especially the polyphone and the homophone in social media. To cope with it effectively, we propose a new structure, the Extractor, based on attention mechanisms and design novel attention networks named Extractor-attention network (EAN). Unlike most of previous works, EAN uses a combination of a word encoder and a Pinyin character encoder instead of a single encoder. It improves the capability of Chinese text representation. Moreover, compared with the hybrid encoder methods, EAN has more complex combination architecture and more reducing parameters structures. Thus, EAN can take advantage of a large amount of information that comes from multi-inputs and alleviates efficiency issues. The proposed model achieves the state of the art results on 5 large datasets for Chinese text classification. 
10	Machine learning algorithms for controlling devices will need to learn quickly, with few trials. Such a goal can be attained with concepts borrowed from continental philosophy and formalized using tools from the mathematical theory of categories. Illustrations of this approach are presented on a cyberphysical system: the slot car game, and also on Atari 2600 games.
01	We improve the recently-proposed ``MixMatch semi-supervised learning algorithm by introducing two new techniques: distribution alignment and augmentation anchoring.- Distribution alignment encourages the marginal distribution of predictions on unlabeled data to be close to the marginal distribution of ground-truth labels.- Augmentation anchoring} feeds multiple strongly augmented versions of an input into the model and encourages each output to be close to the prediction for a weakly-augmented version of the same input.To produce strong augmentations, we propose a variant of AutoAugment which learns the augmentation policy while the model is being trained.Our new algorithm, dubbed ReMixMatch, is significantly more data-efficient than prior work, requiring between 5 times and 16 times less data to reach the same accuracy. For example, on CIFAR-10 with 250 labeled examples we reach 93.73% accuracy (compared to MixMatch's accuracy of 93.58% with 4000 examples) and a median accuracy of 84.92% with just four labels per class.
10	What would be learned by variational autoencoder(VAE) and what influence the disentanglement of VAE? This paper tries to preliminarily address VAE's intrinsic dimension, real factor, disentanglement and indicator issues theoretically in the idealistic situation and implementation issue practically through noise modeling perspective in the realistic case.  On intrinsic dimension issue, due to information conservation, the idealistic VAE learns and only learns intrinsic factor dimension. Besides, suggested by mutual information separation property, the constraint induced by Gaussian prior to the VAE objective encourages the information sparsity in dimension. On disentanglement issue,   subsequently, inspired by information conservation theorem the clarification on disentanglement in this paper is made. On real factor issue, due to factor equivalence, the idealistic VAE possibly learns any factor set in the equivalence class.  On indicator issue, the behavior of current disentanglement metric is discussed, and several performance indicators regarding the disentanglement and generating influence are subsequently raised to evaluate the performance of VAE model and to supervise the used factors. On implementation issue, the experiments under noise modeling and constraints empirically testify the theoretical analysis and also show their own characteristic in pursuing disentanglement.
10	Conversational question answering (CQA) is a novel QA task that requires the understanding of dialogue context. Different from traditional single-turn machine reading comprehension (MRC), CQA is a comprehensive task comprised of passage reading, coreference resolution, and contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose an innovative contextualized attention-based deep neural network, SDNet, to fuse context into traditional MRC models. Our model leverages both inter-attention and self-attention to comprehend the conversation and passage. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel method to integrate the BERT contextual model as a sub-module in our network. Empirical results show the effectiveness of SDNet. On the CoQA leaderboard, it outperforms the previous best model's F1 score by 1.6%. Our ensemble model further improves the F1 score by 2.7%.
10	We outline the problem of concept drifts for time series data. In this work, we analyze the temporal inconsistency of streaming wireless signals in the context of device-free passive indoor localization. We show that data obtained from WiFi channel state information (CSI) can be used to train a robust system capable of performing room level localization. One of the most challenging issues for such a system is the movement of input data distribution to an unexplored space over time, which leads to an unwanted shift in the learned boundaries of the output space. In this work, we propose a phase and magnitude augmented feature space along with a standardization technique that is little affected by drifts. We show that this robust representation of the data yields better learning accuracy and requires less number of retraining. 
01	We present Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), a general approach for learning node representations within graph-structured data in an unsupervised manner. DGI relies on maximizing mutual information between patch representations and corresponding high-level summaries of graphs---both derived using established graph convolutional network architectures. The learnt patch representations summarize subgraphs centered around nodes of interest, and can thus be reused for downstream node-wise learning tasks. In contrast to most prior approaches to unsupervised learning with GCNs, DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive and inductive learning setups. We demonstrate competitive performance on a variety of node classification benchmarks, which at times even exceeds the performance of supervised learning.
10	In societies with well developed internet infrastructure, social media is the leading medium of communication for various social issues especially for breaking news situations. In rural Uganda however, public community radio is still a dominant means for news dissemination. Community radio gives audience to the general public especially to individuals living in rural areas, and thus plays an important role in giving a voice to those living in the broadcast area. It is an avenue for participatory communication and a tool relevant in both economic and social development.This is supported by the rise to ubiquity of mobile phones providing access to phone-in or text-in talk shows. In this paper, we describe an approach to analysing the readily available community radio data with machine learning-based speech keyword spotting techniques. We identify the keywords of interest related to agriculture and build models to automatically identify these keywords from audio streams. Our contribution through these techniques is a cost-efficient and effective way to monitor food security concerns particularly in rural areas. Through keyword spotting and radio talk show analysis, issues such as crop diseases, pests, drought and famine can be captured and fed into an early warning system for stakeholders and policy makers.
10	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become the gold standard when it comes to learning generative models for high-dimensional distributions. Since their advent, numerous variations of GANs have been introduced in the literature, primarily focusing on utilization of novel loss functions, optimization/regularization strategies and network architectures. In this paper, we turn our attention to the generator and investigate the use of high-order polynomials as an alternative class of universal function approximators. Concretely, we propose PolyGAN, where we model the data generator by means of a high-order polynomial whose unknown parameters are naturally represented by high-order tensors. We introduce two tensor decompositions that significantly reduce the number of parameters and show how they can be efficiently implemented by hierarchical neural networks that only employ linear/convolutional blocks. We exhibit for the first time that by using our approach a GAN generator can approximate the data distribution without using any activation functions. Thorough experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real data (images and 3D point clouds) demonstrates the merits of PolyGAN against the state of the art.
10	We present a novel approach for training neural abstract architectures which in- corporates (partial) supervision over the machine’s interpretable components. To cleanly capture the set of neural architectures to which our method applies, we introduce the concept of a differential neural computational machine (∂NCM) and show that several existing architectures (e.g., NTMs, NRAMs) can be instantiated as a ∂NCM and can thus benefit from any amount of additional supervision over their interpretable components. Based on our method, we performed a detailed experimental evaluation with both, the NTM and NRAM architectures, and showed that the approach leads to significantly better convergence and generalization capabilities of the learning phase than when training using only input-output examples.
10	We present Random Partition Relaxation (RPR), a method for strong quantization of the parameters of convolutional neural networks to binary (+1/-1) and ternary (+1/0/-1) values. Starting from a pretrained model, we first quantize the weights and then relax random partitions of them to their continuous values for retraining before quantizing them again and switching to another weight partition for further adaptation.  We empirically evaluate the performance of RPR with ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and GoogLeNet on the ImageNet classification task for binary and ternary weight networks. We show accuracies beyond the state-of-the-art for binary- and ternary-weight GoogLeNet and competitive performance for ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 using a SGD-based training method that can easily be integrated into existing frameworks. 
01	A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is environment generalization: a policy trained to solve a task in one environment often fails to solve the same task in a slightly different test environment. A common approach to improve inter-environment transfer is to learn policies that are invariant to the distribution of testing environments. However, we argue that instead of being invariant, the policy should identify the specific nuances of an environment and exploit them to achieve better performance. In this work, we propose the “Environment-Probing” Interaction (EPI) policy, a policy that probes a new environment to extract an implicit understanding of that environment’s behavior. Once this environment-specific information is obtained, it is used as an additional input to a task-specific policy that can now perform environment-conditioned actions to solve a task. To learn these EPI-policies, we present a reward function based on transition predictability. Specifically, a higher reward is given if the trajectory generated by the EPI-policy can be used to better predict transitions. We experimentally show that EPI-conditioned task-specific policies significantly outperform commonly used policy generalization methods on novel testing environments.
01	Convolutional architectures have recently been shown to be competitive on manysequence modelling tasks when compared to the de-facto standard of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) while providing computational and modelling advantages due to inherent parallelism. However, currently, there remains a performancegap to more expressive stochastic RNN variants, especially those with several layers of dependent random variables. In this work, we propose stochastic temporal convolutional networks (STCNs), a novel architecture that combines the computational advantages of temporal convolutional networks (TCN) with the representational power and robustness of stochastic latent spaces. In particular, we propose a hierarchy of stochastic latent variables that captures temporal dependencies at different time-scales. The architecture is modular and flexible due to the decoupling of the deterministic and stochastic layers. We show that the proposed architecture achieves state of the art log-likelihoods across several tasks. Finally, the model is capable of predicting high-quality synthetic samples over a long-range temporal horizon in modelling of handwritten text.
10	In this paper we present a novel optimization algorithm called Advanced Neuroevolution. The aim for this algorithm is to train deep neural networks, and eventually act as an alternative to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants as needed.We evaluated our algorithm on the MNIST dataset, as well as on several global optimization problems such as the Ackley function. We find the algorithm performing relatively well for both cases, overtaking other global optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Evolution Strategies (ES).
10	We propose a general framework to construct unsupervised models capable of learning distributed representations of discrete structures such as graphs based on R-Convolution kernels and distributed semantics research. Our framework combines the insights and observations of Deep Graph Kernels and Graph2Vec towards a unified methodology for performing similarity learning on graphs of arbitrary size. This is exemplified by our own instance G2DR which extends Graph2Vec from labelled graphs towards unlabelled graphs and tackles issues of diagonal dominance through pruning of the subgraph vocabulary composing graphs. These changes produce new state of the art results in the downstream application of G2DR embeddings in graph classification tasks over datasets with small labelled graphs in binary classification to multi-class classification on large unlabelled graphs using an off-the-shelf support vector machine. 
10	As a widely-accepted evaluation criterion, complexity has attracted more and more attention in the design of language models. The parameter count is a proxy for complexity, which is often reported and compared in research papers. In general, more parameters means better model performance, but higher complexity. Therefore, reconciling the contradiction between the complexity and the model performance is necessary. In this paper, we propose a simple method to make use of model parameters more effectively, so that the LSTM-based language models can reach better results without the cost of increasing parameters. The method constructs another small-scale LSTM with a part of parameters originally belonging to the vanilla LSTM in each layer, whose output can assist the next layer in processing the output of the vanilla LSTM. We name these two LSTMs Major Minor LSTMs. In experiments, we demonstrate the language model with Major Minor LSTMs surpasses the existing state-of-the-art model on Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 with fewer parameters.
01	In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model, called E2Efold, for RNA secondary structure prediction which can effectively take into account the inherent constraints in the problem. The key idea of E2Efold is to directly predict the RNA base-pairing matrix, and use an unrolled algorithm for constrained programming as the template for deep architectures to enforce constraints. With comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of E2Efold: it predicts significantly better structures compared to previous SOTA (especially for pseudoknotted structures), while being as efficient as the fastest algorithms in terms of inference time.
10	In this paper, we propose the generation of accented speech using generative adversarialnetworks. Through this work we make two main contributions a) Theability to condition latent representations while generating realistic speech samplesb) The ability to efficiently generate long speech samples by using a novellatent variable transformation module that is trained using policy gradients. Previousmethods are limited in being able to generate only relatively short samplesor are not very efficient at generating long samples. The generated speech samplesare validated through a number of various evaluation measures viz, a WGANcritic loss and through subjective scores on user evaluations against competitivespeech synthesis baselines and detailed ablation analysis of the proposed model.The evaluations demonstrate that the model generates realistic long speech samplesconditioned on accent efficiently.
01	We present a simple neural model that given a formula and a property tries to answer the question whether the formula has the given property, for example whether a propositional formula is always true. The structure of the formula is captured by a feedforward neural network recursively built for the given formula in a top-down manner. The results of this network are then processed by two recurrent neural networks. One of the interesting aspects of our model is how propositional atoms are treated. For example, the model is insensitive to their names, it only matters whether they are the same or distinct.
01	Learning multimodal representations is a fundamentally complex research problem due to the presence of multiple heterogeneous sources of information. Although the presence of multiple modalities provides additional valuable information, there are two key challenges to address when learning from multimodal data: 1) models must learn the complex intra-modal and cross-modal interactions for prediction and 2) models must be robust to unexpected missing or noisy modalities during testing. In this paper, we propose to optimize for a joint generative-discriminative objective across multimodal data and labels. We introduce a model that factorizes representations into two sets of independent factors: multimodal discriminative and modality-specific generative factors. Multimodal discriminative factors are shared across all modalities and contain joint multimodal features required for discriminative tasks such as sentiment prediction. Modality-specific generative factors are unique for each modality and contain the information required for generating data. Experimental results show that our model is able to learn meaningful multimodal representations that achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on six multimodal datasets. Our model demonstrates flexible generative capabilities by conditioning on independent factors and can reconstruct missing modalities without significantly impacting performance. Lastly, we interpret our factorized representations to understand the interactions that influence multimodal learning.
10	Depth is a key component of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), however, designing depth is heuristic and requires many human efforts. We propose AutoGrow to automate depth discovery in DNNs: starting from a shallow seed architecture, AutoGrow grows new layers if the growth improves the accuracy; otherwise, stops growing and thus discovers the depth. We propose robust growing and stopping policies to generalize to different network architectures and datasets. Our experiments show that by applying the same policy to different network architectures, AutoGrow can always discover near-optimal depth on various datasets of MNIST, FashionMNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet. For example, in terms of accuracy-computation trade-off, AutoGrow discovers a better depth combination in ResNets than human experts. Our AutoGrow is efficient. It discovers depth within similar time of training a single DNN.
10	Neural network has attracted great attention for a long time and many researchers are devoted  to improve the effectiveness of  neural network training algorithms. Though stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and other explicit gradient-based methods are widely adopted, there are still many challenges such as gradient vanishing and small step sizes, which leads to slow convergence and instability of SGD algorithms. Motivated by error back propagation (BP)  and proximal methods, we propose a semi-implicit back propagation method for neural network training. Similar to BP, the difference on the neurons are propagated in a backward fashion and the parameters are updated with proximal mapping. The implicit update for both hidden neurons and parameters allows to choose large step size in the training algorithm. Finally, we also show that any fixed point of  convergent sequences produced by this algorithm is a stationary point of the objective loss function. The experiments on both MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed semi-implicit BP algorithm leads to  better performance in terms of both loss decreasing and training/validation accuracy, compared to SGD and a similar algorithm ProxBP.
01	Regularization and normalization have become indispensable components in training deep neural networks, resulting in faster training and improved generalization performance. We propose the projected error function regularization loss (PER) that encourages activations to follow the standard normal distribution. PER randomly projects activations onto one-dimensional space and computes the regularization loss in the projected space. PER is similar to the Pseudo-Huber loss in the projected space, thus taking advantage of both $L^1$ and $L^2$ regularization losses. Besides, PER can capture the interaction between hidden units by projection vector drawn from a unit sphere. By doing so, PER minimizes the upper bound of the Wasserstein distance of order one between an empirical distribution of activations and the standard normal distribution. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to regularize activations via distribution matching in the probability distribution space. We evaluate the proposed method on the image classification task and the word-level language modeling task.
10	Large mini-batch parallel SGD is commonly used for distributed training of deep networks. Approaches that use tightly-coupled exact distributed averaging based on AllReduce are sensitive to slow nodes and high-latency communication. In this work we show the applicability of Stochastic Gradient Push (SGP) for distributed training. SGP uses a gossip algorithm called PushSum for approximate distributed averaging, allowing for much more loosely coupled communications which can be beneficial in high-latency or high-variability scenarios. The tradeoff is that approximate distributed averaging injects additional noise in the gradient which can affect the train and test accuracies. We prove that SGP converges to a stationary point of smooth, non-convex objective functions. Furthermore, we validate empirically the potential of SGP. For example, using 32 nodes with 8 GPUs per node to train ResNet-50 on ImageNet, where nodes communicate over 10Gbps Ethernet, SGP completes 90 epochs in around 1.5 hours while AllReduce SGD takes over 5 hours, and the top-1 validation accuracy of SGP remains within 1.2% of that obtained using AllReduce SGD.
10	The construction of adversarial images is a search problem in high dimensions within a small region around a target image. The goal is to find an imperceptibly modified image that is misclassified by a target model. In the black-box setting, only sporadic feedback is provided through occasional model evaluations. In this paper we provide a new algorithm whose search strategy is based on an intriguingly simple iterative principle: We randomly pick a low frequency component of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and either add or subtract it to the target image. Model evaluations are only required to identify whether an operation decreases the adversarial loss. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can be used for targeted and untargeted attacks --- resulting in previously unprecedented query efficiency in both settings. We require a median of 600 black-box model queries (ResNet-50) to produce an adversarial ImageNet image, and we successfully attack Google Cloud Vision with 2500 median queries, averaging to a cost of only $3 per image. We argue that our proposed algorithm should serve as a strong baseline for future adversarial black-box attacks, in particular because it is extremely fast and can be implemented in less than 20 lines of PyTorch code. 
01	We propose to study the problem of few-shot graph classification in graph neural networks (GNNs) to recognize unseen classes, given limited labeled graph examples. Despite several interesting GNN variants being proposed recently for node and graph classification tasks, when faced with scarce labeled examples in the few-shot setting, these GNNs exhibit significant loss in classification performance. Here, we present an approach where a probability measure is assigned to each graph based on the spectrum of the graph’s normalized Laplacian. This enables us to accordingly cluster the graph base-labels associated with each graph into super-classes, where the L^p Wasserstein distance serves as our underlying distance metric. Subsequently, a super-graph constructed based on the super-classes is then fed to our proposed GNN framework which exploits the latent inter-class relationships made explicit by the super-graph to achieve better class label separation among the graphs. We conduct exhaustive empirical evaluations of our proposed method and show that it outperforms both the adaptation of state-of-the-art graph classification methods to few-shot scenario and our naive baseline GNNs. Additionally, we also extend and study the behavior of our method to semi-supervised and active learning scenarios.
10	Despite recent progress, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) still suffer from training instability, requiring careful consideration of architecture design choices and hyper-parameter tuning. The reason for this fragile training behaviour is partially due to the discriminator performing well very quickly; its loss converges to zero, providing no reliable backpropagation signal to the generator. In this work we introduce a new technique - progressive augmentation of GANs (PA-GAN) - that helps to overcome this fundamental limitation and improve the overall stability of GAN training. The key idea is to gradually increase the task difficulty of the discriminator by progressively augmenting its input space, thus enabling continuous learning of the generator. We show that the proposed progressive augmentation preserves the original GAN objective, does not bias the optimality of the discriminator and encourages the healthy competition between the generator and discriminator, leading to a better-performing generator. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on multiple benchmarks (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10, CELEBA) for the image generation task.
10	There are time series that are amenable to recurrent neural network (RNN) solutions when treated as sequences, but some series, e.g. asynchronous time series, provide a richer variation of feature types than current RNN cells take into account. In order to address such situations, we introduce a unified RNN that handles five different feature types, each in a different manner. Our RNN framework separates sequential features into two groups dependent on their frequency, which we call sparse and dense features, and which affect cell updates differently. Further, we also incorporate time features at the sequential level that relate to the time between specified events in the sequence and are used to modify the cell's memory state. We also include two types of static (whole sequence level) features, one related to time and one not, which are combined with the encoder output. The experiments show that the proposed modeling framework does increase performance compared to standard cells.
10	ResNet structure has achieved great success since its debut. In this paper, we study the stability of learning ResNet. Specifically, we consider the ResNet block $h_l = \phi(h_{l-1}+\tau\cdot g(h_{l-1}))$ where $\phi(\cdot)$ is ReLU activation and $\tau$ is a scalar. We show that for standard initialization used in practice, $\tau =1/\Omega(\sqrt{L})$ is a sharp value in characterizing the stability of forward/backward process of ResNet, where $L$ is the number of residual blocks. Specifically, stability is guaranteed for $\tau\le 1/\Omega(\sqrt{L})$ while conversely forward process explodes when $\tau>L^{-\frac{1}{2}+c}$ for a positive constant $c$.  Moreover,  if ResNet is properly over-parameterized, we show for $\tau \le 1/\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{L})$ gradient descent is guaranteed to find the global minima \footnote{We use $\tilde{\Omega}(\cdot)$ to hide logarithmic factor.}, which significantly enlarges the range of $\tau\le 1/\tilde{\Omega}(L)$ that admits  global convergence  in previous work. We also demonstrate that the over-parameterization requirement of ResNet only weakly depends on the depth, which corroborates the advantage of ResNet over vanilla feedforward network. Empirically, with $\tau\le1/\sqrt{L}$, deep ResNet can be easily trained even without normalization layer. Moreover, adding $\tau=1/\sqrt{L}$ can also improve the performance of ResNet with normalization layer.
10	The generalization ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is intertwined with model complexity, robustness, and capacity. Through establishing an equivalence between a DNN and a noisy communication channel, we characterize generalization and fault tolerance for unbounded adversarial attacks in terms of information-theoretic quantities. Invoking rate-distortion theory, we suggest that excess capacity is a significant cause of vulnerability to adversarial examples.
10	Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been repeatedly shown to perform well on image classification tasks, successfully recognizing a broad array of objects when given sufficient training data. Methods for object localization, however, are still in need of substantial improvement. Common approaches to this problem involve the use of a sliding window, sometimes at multiple scales, providing input to a deep CNN trained to classify the contents of the window. In general, these approaches are time consuming, requiring many classification calculations. In this paper, we offer a fundamentally different approach to the localization of recognized objects in images. Our method is predicated on the idea that a deep CNN capable of recognizing an object must implicitly contain knowledge about object location in its connection weights. We provide a simple method to interpret classifier weights in the context of individual classified images. This method involves the calculation of the derivative of network generated activation patterns, such as the activation of output class label units, with regard to each in- put pixel, performing a sensitivity analysis that identifies the pixels that, in a local sense, have the greatest influence on internal representations and object recognition. These derivatives can be efficiently computed using a single backward pass through the deep CNN classifier, producing a sensitivity map of the image. We demonstrate that a simple linear mapping can be learned from sensitivity maps to bounding box coordinates, localizing the recognized object. Our experimental results, using real-world data sets for which ground truth localization information is known, reveal competitive accuracy from our fast technique.
10	Accurate rent prediction in real estate investment can help in generating capital gains and guaranty a financial success. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive analysis and study of eleven machine learning algorithms for rent prediction, including Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, KNN, ML-KNN, Locally Weighted Learning, SMO, SVM, J48, lazy Decision Tree (i.e., lazy DT), and KStar algorithms. Our contribution in this paper is twofold: (1) We present a comprehensive analysis of internal and external attributes of a real-estate housing dataset and their correlation with rental prices. (2) We use rental prediction as a platform to study and compare the performance of eager vs. lazy machine learning methods using myriad of ML algorithms.  We train our rent prediction models using a Zillow data set of 4K real estate properties in Virginia State of the US, including three house types of single-family, townhouse, and condo. Each data instance in the dataset has 21 internal attributes (e.g., area space, price, number of bed/bath, rent, school rating, so forth). In addition to Zillow data, external attributes like walk/transit score, and crime rate are collected from online data sources. A subset of the collected features - determined by the PCA technique-  are selected to tune the parameters of the prediction models. We employ a hierarchical clustering approach to cluster the data based on two factors of house type, and average rent estimate of zip codes. We evaluate and compare the efficacy of the tuned prediction models based on two metrics of R-squared and Mean Absolute Error, applied on unseen data. Based on our study, lazy models like KStar lead to higher accuracy and lower prediction error compared to eager methods like J48 and LR. However, it is not necessarily found to be an overarching conclusion drawn from the comparison between all the lazy and eager methods in this work. 
10	Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results across several sequential decision-making tasks. However, reinforcement learning struggles to learn efficiently, thus limiting its pervasive application to several challenging problems. A typical RL agent learns solely from its own trial-and-error experiences, requiring many experiences to learn a successful policy. To alleviate this problem, we propose collaborative inter-agent knowledge distillation (CIKD). CIKD is a learning framework that uses an ensemble of RL agents to execute different policies in the environment while sharing knowledge amongst agents in the ensemble. Our experiments demonstrate that CIKD improves upon state-of-the-art RL methods in sample efficiency and performance on several challenging MuJoCo benchmark tasks. Additionally, we present an in-depth investigation on how CIKD leads to performance improvements.
10	In complex simulated environments, model-based reinforcement learning methods typically lag the asymptotic performance of model-free approaches. This paper uses two MuJoCo environments to understand this gap through a series of ablation experiments designed to separate the contributions of the dynamics model and planner. These reveal the importance of long planning horizons, beyond those typically used. A dynamics model that directly predicts distant states, based on current state and a long sequence of actions, is introduced. This avoids the need for many recursions during long-range planning, and thus is able to yield more accurate state estimates. These accurate predictions allow us to uncover the relationship between model accuracy and performance, and translate to higher task reward that matches or exceeds current state-of-the-art model-free approaches.
10	We introduce an unsupervised structure learning algorithm for deep, feed-forward, neural networks. We propose a new interpretation for depth and inter-layer connectivity where a hierarchy of independencies in the input distribution is encoded in the network structure. This results in structures allowing neurons to connect to neurons in any deeper layer skipping intermediate layers. Moreover, neurons in deeper layers encode low-order (small condition sets) independencies and have a wide scope of the input, whereas neurons in the first layers encode higher-order (larger condition sets) independencies and have a narrower scope. Thus, the depth of the network is automatically determined---equal to the maximal order of independence in the input distribution, which is the recursion-depth of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm constructs two main graphical models: 1) a generative latent graph (a deep belief network) learned from data and 2) a deep discriminative graph constructed from the generative latent graph. We prove that conditional dependencies between the nodes in the learned generative latent graph are preserved in the class-conditional discriminative graph. Finally, a deep neural network structure is constructed based on the discriminative graph. We demonstrate on image classification benchmarks that the algorithm replaces the deepest layers (convolutional and dense layers) of common convolutional networks, achieving high classification accuracy, while constructing significantly smaller structures. The proposed structure learning algorithm requires a small computational cost and runs efficiently on a standard desktop CPU.
01	Many machine learning problems can be expressed as the optimization of some cost functional over a parametric family of probability distributions. It is often beneficial to solve such optimization problems using natural gradient methods. These methods are invariant to the parametrization of the family, and thus can yield more effective optimization. Unfortunately, computing the natural gradient is challenging as it requires inverting a high dimensional matrix at each iteration. We propose a general framework to approximate the natural gradient for the Wasserstein metric, by leveraging a dual formulation of the metric restricted to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Our approach leads to an estimator for gradient direction that can trade-off accuracy and computational cost, with theoretical guarantees. We verify its accuracy on simple examples, and show the advantage of using such an estimator in classification tasks on \texttt{Cifar10} and \texttt{Cifar100} empirically. 
10	Powerful generative models, particularly in Natural Language Modelling, are commonly trained by maximizing a variational lower bound on the data log likelihood. These models often suffer from poor use of their latent variable, with ad-hoc annealing factors used to encourage retention of information in the latent variable. We discuss an alternative and general approach to latent variable modelling, based on an objective that encourages a perfect reconstruction by tying a stochastic autoencoder with a variational autoencoder (VAE). This ensures by design that the latent variable captures information about the observations, whilst retaining the ability to generate well. Interestingly, although our model is fundamentally different to a VAE, the lower bound attained is identical to the standard VAE bound but with the addition of a simple pre-factor; thus, providing a formal interpretation of the commonly used, ad-hoc pre-factors in training VAEs.
10	This paper proposes Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder (DirVAE) using a Dirichlet prior for a continuous latent variable that exhibits the characteristic of the categorical probabilities. To infer the parameters of DirVAE, we utilize the stochastic gradient method by approximating the Gamma distribution, which is a component of the Dirichlet distribution, with the inverse Gamma CDF approximation. Additionally, we reshape the component collapsing issue by investigating two problem sources, which are decoder weight collapsing and latent value collapsing, and we show that DirVAE has no component collapsing; while Gaussian VAE exhibits the decoder weight collapsing and Stick-Breaking VAE shows the latent value collapsing. The experimental results show that 1) DirVAE models the latent representation result with the best log-likelihood compared to the baselines; and 2) DirVAE produces more interpretable latent values with no collapsing issues which the baseline models suffer from. Also, we show that the learned latent representation from the DirVAE achieves the best classification accuracy in the semi-supervised and the supervised classification tasks on MNIST, OMNIGLOT, and SVHN compared to the baseline VAEs. Finally, we demonstrated that the DirVAE augmented topic models show better performances in most cases.
10	Representation learning in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms focuses on extracting useful features for choosing good actions. Expressive representations are essential for learning well-performed policies. In this paper, we study the relationship between the state representation assigned by the state extractor and the performance of the RL agent. We observe that representations assigned by the better state extractor are more scattered than which assigned by the worse one. Moreover, RL agents achieving high performances always have high rank matrices which are composed by their representations. Based on our observations, we formally define expressiveness of the state extractor as the rank of the matrix composed by representations. Therefore, we propose to promote expressiveness so as to improve algorithm performances, and we call it Expressiveness Promoted DRL. We apply our method on both policy gradient and value-based algorithms, and experimental results on 55 Atari games show the superiority of our proposed method.
10	In geometric computer vision applications, multi-image feature matching gives more accurate and robust solutions compared to simple two-image matching. In this work, we formulate multi-image matching as a graph embedding problem, then use a Graph Neural Network to learn an appropriate embedding function for aligning image features. We use cycle consistency to train our network in an unsupervised fashion, since ground truth correspondence can be difficult or expensive to acquire. Geometric consistency losses are added to aid training, though unlike optimization based methods no geometric information is necessary at inference time. To the best of our knowledge, no other works have used graph neural networks for multi-image feature matching. Our experiments show that our method is competitive with other optimization based approaches.
10	"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used models for sequence data. Just like for feedforward networks, it has become common to build ""deep"" RNNs, i.e., stack multiple recurrent layers to obtain higher-level abstractions of the data. However, this works only for a handful of layers. Unlike feedforward networks, stacking more than a few recurrent units (e.g., LSTM cells) usually hurts model performance, the reason being vanishing or exploding gradients during training. We investigate the training of multi-layer RNNs and examine the magnitude of the gradients as they propagate through the network. We show that, depending on the structure of the basic recurrent unit, the gradients are systematically attenuated or amplified, so that with an increasing depth they tend to vanish, respectively explode. Based on our analysis we design a new type of gated cell that better preserves gradient magnitude, and therefore makes it possible to train deeper RNNs. We experimentally validate our design with five different sequence modelling tasks on three different datasets. The proposed stackable recurrent (STAR) cell allows for substantially deeper recurrent architectures, with improved performance."
01	Navigation is crucial for animal behavior and is assumed to require an internal representation of the external environment, termed a cognitive map. The precise form of this representation is often considered to be a metric representation of space. An internal representation, however, is judged by its contribution to performance on a given task, and may thus vary between different types of navigation tasks. Here we train a recurrent neural network that controls an agent performing several navigation tasks in a simple environment. To focus on internal representations, we split learning into a task-agnostic pre-training stage that modifies internal connectivity and a task-specific Q learning stage that controls the network's output. We show that pre-training shapes the attractor landscape of the networks, leading to either a continuous attractor, discrete attractors or a disordered state. These structures induce bias onto the Q-Learning phase, leading to a performance pattern across the tasks corresponding to metric and topological regularities. Our results show that, in recurrent networks, inductive bias takes the form of attractor landscapes -- which can be shaped by pre-training and analyzed using dynamical systems methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-metric representations are useful for navigation tasks.  
10	"Imitation Learning (IL) is a machine learning approach to learn a policy from a set of demonstrations. IL can be useful to kick-start learning before applying reinforcement learning (RL) but it can also be useful on its own, e.g. to learn to imitate human players in video games. However, a major limitation of current IL approaches is that they learn only a single ``""average"" policy based on a dataset that possibly contains demonstrations of numerous different types of behaviors. In this paper, we present a new approach called Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that instead learns a repertoire of behaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs with behavioral descriptions. The outcome of this approach is a single neural network policy conditioned on a behavior description that can be precisely modulated. We apply this approach to train a policy on 7,777 human demonstrations for the build-order planning task in StarCraft II. Dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to construct a low-dimensional behavioral space from the high-dimensional army unit composition of each demonstration. The results demonstrate that the learned policy can be effectively manipulated to express distinct behaviors. Additionally, by applying the UCB1 algorithm, the policy can adapt its behavior -in-between games- to reach a performance beyond that of the traditional IL baseline approach."
10	Auxiliary learning has been shown to improve the generalisation performance of a principal task. But typically, this requires manually-defined auxiliary tasks based on domain knowledge. In this paper, we consider that it may be possible to automatically learn these auxiliary tasks to best suit the principal task, towards optimum auxiliary tasks without any human knowledge. We propose a novel method, Meta Auxiliary Learning (MAXL), which we design for the task of image classification, where the auxiliary task is hierarchical sub-class image classification. The role of the meta learner is to determine sub-class target labels to train a multi-task evaluator, such that these labels improve the generalisation performance on the principal task. Experiments on three different CIFAR datasets show that MAXL outperforms baseline auxiliary learning methods, and is competitive even with a method which uses human-defined sub-class hierarchies. MAXL is self-supervised and general, and therefore offers a promising new direction towards automated generalisation.
10	Let us share the joy of our unprecedented discovery with you: Physical Geometry and Biological Geometry are the outcome of the physical laws and biological laws respectively, and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) has to be a combination of both design and learning instead of learning alone, with that we propose Artificial Design, a bio-physical inspired mathematical model for Hierarchical Multi-Agent Multi-Environment Model-agnostic Policy-agnostic Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMMMPDRL) based ASI by reusing and extending General Relativity and Universal Darwinism with Geometrization. With Artificial Design we solve Deep Reinforcement Learning blackbox puzzle in AI and ASI. By treating HMMMPDRL as multiverse regardless the mutual exclusiveness between Multi-Agent and Multi-Environment, we reuse General Relativity's 4-Dimensional Pseudo-Riemannian Manifold based SpaceTime Model for Reinforcement Learning part of HMMMPDRL,we also make a T-symmetry extension to General Relativity, replace N-Dimensional space with N-Dimensional GeneSpace, and formulate a N-Dimensional Riemannian Manifold based GeneSpace Model for Deep Learning part of HMMMPDRL, whereas Deep Learning architecture is adopted to approximate very complex state-action space composed environments in HMMMPDRL. By modeling ASI with Artificial Design rigorously in this way, we claim that intelligence, whether natural, artificial, or super-artificial like ASI, is just the geometry effect of N-Dimensional GeneSpace caused by Geometrization, and that paves the way in achieving ASI through Universal Design Automation of Artificial Design in theory. Of course, our Multiversal endeavor won't stop from there, endorse us to artificially co-accelerate human civilization in every possible way you might imagine. 
01	Generative adversarial nets (GANs) are widely used to learn the data sampling process and their performance may heavily depend on the loss functions, given a limited computational budget. This study revisits MMD-GAN that uses the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as the loss function for GAN and makes two contributions. First, we argue that the existing MMD loss function may discourage the learning of fine details in data as it attempts to contract the discriminator outputs of real data. To address this issue, we propose a repulsive loss function to actively learn the difference among the real data by simply rearranging the terms in MMD. Second, inspired by the hinge loss, we propose a bounded Gaussian kernel to stabilize the training of MMD-GAN with the repulsive loss function. The proposed methods are applied to the unsupervised image generation tasks on CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA, and LSUN bedroom datasets. Results show that the repulsive loss function significantly improves over the MMD loss at no additional computational cost and outperforms other representative loss functions. The proposed methods achieve an FID score of 16.21 on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a single DCGAN network and spectral normalization.
10	This paper proposes a novel method to detect anomalies in large datasets under a fully unsupervised setting. The key idea behind our algorithm is to learn the representation underlying normal data. To this end, we leverage the latest clusteringtechnique suitable for handling high dimensional data. This hypothesis provides a reliable starting point for normal data selection. We train an autoencoder from the normal data subset, and iterate between hypothesizing normal candidate subsetbased on clustering and representation learning. The reconstruction error from the learned autoencoder serves as a scoring function to assess the normality of the data. Experimental results on several public benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques and is comparable to semi-supervised techniques in most cases.
10	Counterfactual regret minimization (CRF) is a fundamental and effective technique for solving imperfect information games. However, the original CRF algorithm only works for discrete state and action spaces, and the resulting strategy is maintained as a tabular representation. Such tabular representation limits the method from being directly applied to large games and continuing to improve from a poor strategy profile. In this paper, we propose a double neural representation for the Imperfect Information Games, where one neural network represents the cumulative regret, and the other represents the average strategy. Furthermore, we adopt the counterfactual regret minimization algorithm to optimize this double neural representation. To make neural learning efficient, we also developed several novel techniques including a robust sampling method, mini-batch  Monte Carlo counterfactual regret minimization (MCCFR) and Monte Carlo counterfactual regret minimization plus (MCCFR+) which may be of independent interests. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed double neural algorithm converges significantly better than the reinforcement learning counterpart. 
10	Learned representations of source code enable various software developer tools, e.g., to detect bugs or to predict program properties. At the core of code representations often are word embeddings of identifier names in source code, because identifiers account for the majority of source code vocabulary and convey important semantic information. Unfortunately, there currently is no generally accepted way of evaluating the quality of word embeddings of identifiers, and current evaluations are biased toward specific downstream tasks. This paper presents IdBench, the first benchmark for evaluating to what extent word embeddings of identifiers represent semantic relatedness and similarity. The benchmark is based on thousands of ratings gathered by surveying 500 software developers. We use IdBench to evaluate state-of-the-art embedding techniques proposed for natural language, an embedding technique specifically designed for source code, and lexical string distance functions, as these are often used in current developer tools. Our results show that the effectiveness of embeddings varies significantly across different embedding techniques and that the best available embeddings successfully represent semantic relatedness. On the downside, no existing embedding provides a satisfactory representation of semantic similarities, e.g., because embeddings consider identifiers with opposing meanings as similar, which may lead to fatal mistakes in downstream developer tools. IdBench provides a gold standard to guide the development of novel embeddings that address the current limitations.
10	We propose an efficient online hyperparameter optimization method which uses a joint dynamical system to evaluate the gradient with respect to the hyperparameters. While similar methods are usually limited to hyperparameters with a smooth impact on the model, we show how to apply it to the probability of dropout in neural networks. Finally, we show its effectiveness on two distinct tasks.
10	In this work we explore a straightforward variational Bayes scheme for Recurrent Neural Networks.Firstly, we show that a simple adaptation of truncated backpropagation through time can yield good quality uncertainty estimates and superior regularisation at only a small extra computational cost during training, also reducing the amount of parameters by 80\%.Secondly, we demonstrate how a novel kind of posterior approximation yields further improvements to the performance of Bayesian RNNs. We incorporate local gradient information into the approximate posterior to sharpen it around the current batch statistics. We show how this technique is not exclusive to recurrent neural networks and can be applied more widely to train Bayesian neural networks.We also empirically demonstrate how Bayesian RNNs are superior to traditional RNNs on a language modelling benchmark and an image captioning task, as well as showing how each of these methods improve our model over a variety of other schemes for training them. We also introduce a new benchmark for studying uncertainty for language models so future methods can be easily compared.
10	Data augmentation is a widely used technique in many machine learning tasks, such as image classification, to virtually enlarge the training dataset size and avoid overfitting. Traditional data augmentation techniques for image classification tasks create new samples from the original training data by, for example, flipping, distorting, adding a small amount of noise to, or cropping a patch from an original image. In this paper, we introduce a simple but surprisingly effective data augmentation technique for image classification tasks. With our technique, named SamplePairing, we synthesize a new sample from one image by overlaying another image randomly chosen from the training data (i.e., taking an average of two images for each pixel). By using two images randomly selected from the training set, we can generate N^2 new samples from N training samples. This simple data augmentation technique significantly improved classification accuracy for all the tested datasets; for example, the top-1 error rate was reduced from 33.5% to 29.0% for the ILSVRC 2012 dataset with GoogLeNet and from 8.22% to 6.93% in the CIFAR-10 dataset. We also show that our SamplePairing technique largely improved accuracy when the number of samples in the training set was very small. Therefore, our technique is more valuable for tasks with a limited amount of training data, such as medical imaging tasks.
01	Decentralized training of deep learning models is a key element for enabling data privacy and on-device learning over networks, as well as for efficient scaling to large compute clusters. As current approaches are limited by network bandwidth, we propose the use of communication compression in the decentralized training context. We show that Choco-SGD achieves linear speedup in the number of workers for arbitrary high compression ratios on general non-convex functions, and non-IID training data.  We demonstrate the practical performance of the algorithm in two key scenarios: the training of deep learning models (i) over decentralized user devices, connected by a peer-to-peer network and (ii) in a datacenter. 
10	Simulation of molecular and crystal systems enables insight into interesting chemical properties that benefit processes ranging from drug discovery to material synthesis. However these simulations can be computationally expensive and time consuming despite the approximations through Density Functional Theory (DFT). We propose the Valence Interaction Message Passing Neural Network (VIMPNN) to approximate DFT's ground-state energy calculations. VIMPNN integrates physics prior knowledge such as the existence of different interatomic bounds to estimate more accurate energies. Furthermore, while many previous machine learning methods consider only stable systems, our proposed method is demonstrated on unstable systems at different atomic distances. VIMPNN predictions can be used to determine the stable configurations of systems, i.e. stable distance for atoms -- a necessary step for the future simulation of crystal growth for example. Our method is extensively evaluated on a augmented version of the QM9 dataset that includes unstable molecules, as well as a new dataset of infinite- and finite-size crystals, and is compared with the Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN). VIMPNN has comparable accuracy with DFT, while allowing for 5 orders of magnitude in computational speed up compared to DFT simulations, and produces more accurate and informative potential energy curves than MPNN for estimating stable configurations.
10	We propose a computationally efficient wrapper feature selection method - called Autoencoder and Model Based Elimination of features using Relevance and Redundancy scores (AMBER) - that uses a single ranker model along with autoencoders to perform greedy backward elimination of features. The ranker model is used to prioritize the removal of features that are not critical to the classification task, while the autoencoders are used to prioritize the elimination of correlated features. We demonstrate the superior feature selection ability of AMBER on 4 well known datasets corresponding to different domain applications via comparing the accuracies with other computationally efficient state-of-the-art feature selection techniques. Interestingly, we find that the ranker model that is used for feature selection does not necessarily have to be the same as the final classifier that is trained on the selected features. Finally, we hypothesize that overfitting the ranker model on the training set facilitates the selection of more salient features.
10	Unsupervised landmark learning is the task of learning semantic keypoint-likerepresentations without the use of expensive keypoint-level annotations. A popular approach is to factorize an image into a pose and appearance data stream, then to reconstruct the image from the factorized components. The pose representation should capture a set of consistent and tightly localized landmarks in order to facilitate reconstruction of the input image. Ultimately, we wish for our learned landmarks to focus on the foreground object of interest. However, the reconstruction task of the entire image forces the model to allocate landmarks to model the background. This work explores the effects of factorizing the reconstruction task into separate foreground and background reconstructions, conditioning only the foreground reconstruction on the unsupervised landmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed factorization results in landmarks that are focused on the foreground object of interest. Furthermore, the rendered background quality is also improved, as the background rendering pipeline no longer requires the ill-suited landmarks to model its pose and appearance. We demonstrate this improvement in the context of the video-prediction.
10	When automatically generating a sentence description for an image or video, it often remains unclear how well the generated caption is grounded, or if the model hallucinates based on priors in the dataset and/or the language model. The most common way of relating image regions with words in caption models is through an attention mechanism over the regions that are used as input to predict the next word. The model must therefore learn to predict the attentional weights without knowing the word it should localize. This is difficult to train without grounding supervision since recurrent models can propagate past information and there is no explicit signal to force the captioning model to properly ground the individual decoded words. In this work, we help the model to achieve this via a novel cyclical training regimen that forces the model to localize each word in the image after the sentence decoder generates it, and then reconstruct the sentence from the localized image region(s) to match the ground-truth. Our proposed framework only requires learning one extra fully-connected layer (the localizer), a layer that can be removed at test time. We show that our model significantly improves grounding accuracy without relying on grounding supervision or introducing extra computation during inference for both image and video captioning tasks.
10	Few-shot learning trains image classifiers over datasets with few examples per category. It poses challenges for the optimization algorithms, which typically require many examples to fine-tune the model parameters for new categories. Distance-learning-based approaches avoid the optimization issue by embedding the images into a metric space and applying the nearest neighbor classifier for new categories. In this paper, we propose to exploit the object-level relation to learn the image relation feature, which is converted into a distance directly.For a new category, even though its images are not seen by the model, some objects may appear in the training images. Hence, object-level relation is useful for inferring the relation of images from unseen categories. Consequently, our model generalizes well for new categories without fine-tuning.Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
10	In this work, we focus on the problem of grounding language by training an agentto follow a set of natural language instructions and navigate to a target objectin a 2D grid environment. The agent receives visual information through rawpixels and a natural language instruction telling what task needs to be achieved.Other than these two sources of information, our model does not have any priorinformation of both the visual and textual modalities and is end-to-end trainable.We develop an attention mechanism for multi-modal fusion of visual and textualmodalities that allows the agent to learn to complete the navigation tasks and alsoachieve language grounding. Our experimental results show that our attentionmechanism outperforms the existing multi-modal fusion mechanisms proposed inorder to solve the above mentioned navigation task. We demonstrate through thevisualization of attention weights that our model learns to correlate attributes ofthe object referred in the instruction with visual representations and also showthat the learnt textual representations are semantically meaningful as they followvector arithmetic and are also consistent enough to induce translation between instructionsin different natural languages. We also show that our model generalizeseffectively to unseen scenarios and exhibit zero-shot generalization capabilities.In order to simulate the above described challenges, we introduce a new 2D environmentfor an agent to jointly learn visual and textual modalities
01	Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs is an important step toward salable machine learning on real-world dynamic networks. The evolving nature of temporal dynamic graphs requires handling new nodes as well as capturing temporal patterns. The node embeddings, which are now functions of time, should represent both the static node features and the evolving topological structures. Moreover, node and topological features can be temporal as well, whose patterns the node embeddings should also capture. We propose the temporal graph attention (TGAT) layer to efficiently aggregate temporal-topological neighborhood features to learn the time-feature interactions. For TGAT, we use the self-attention mechanism as building block and develop a novel functional time encoding technique based on the classical Bochner's theorem from harmonic analysis. By stacking TGAT layers, the network recognizes the node embeddings as functions of time and is able to inductively infer embeddings for both new and observed nodes as the graph evolves. The proposed approach handles both node classification and link prediction task, and can be naturally extended to include the temporal edge features. We evaluate our method with transductive and inductive tasks under temporal settings with two benchmark and one industrial dataset. Our TGAT model compares favorably to state-of-the-art baselines as well as the previous temporal graph embedding approaches.
01	This paper introduces a novel method to perform transfer learning across domains and tasks, formulating it as a problem of learning to cluster. The key insight is that, in addition to features, we can transfer similarity information and this is sufficient to learn a similarity function and clustering network to perform both domain adaptation and cross-task transfer learning. We begin by reducing categorical information to pairwise constraints, which only considers whether two instances belong to the same class or not (pairwise semantic similarity). This similarity is category-agnostic and can be learned from data in the source domain using a similarity network. We then present two novel approaches for performing transfer learning using this similarity function. First, for unsupervised domain adaptation, we design a new loss function to regularize classification with a constrained clustering loss, hence learning a clustering network with the transferred similarity metric generating the training inputs. Second, for cross-task learning (i.e., unsupervised clustering with unseen categories), we propose a framework to reconstruct and estimate the number of semantic clusters, again using the clustering network. Since the similarity network is noisy, the key is to use a robust clustering algorithm, and we show that our formulation is more robust than the alternative constrained and unconstrained clustering approaches. Using this method, we first show state of the art results for the challenging cross-task problem, applied on Omniglot and ImageNet. Our results show that we can reconstruct semantic clusters with high accuracy. We then evaluate the performance of cross-domain transfer using images from the Office-31 and SVHN-MNIST tasks and present top accuracy on both datasets.  Our approach doesn't explicitly deal with domain discrepancy. If we combine with a domain adaptation loss, it shows further improvement.
10	In some important computer vision domains, such as medical or hyperspectral imaging, we care about the classification of tiny objects in large images. However, most Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification were developed using biased datasets that contain large objects, in mostly central image positions. To assess whether classical CNN architectures work well for tiny object classification we build a comprehensive testbed containing two datasets: one derived from MNIST digits and one from histopathology images. This testbed allows controlled experiments to stress-test CNN architectures with a broad spectrum of signal-to-noise ratios. Our observations indicate that: (1) There exists a limit to signal-to-noise below which CNNs fail to generalize and that this limit is affected by dataset size - more data leading to better performances; however, the amount of training data required for the model to generalize scales rapidly with the inverse of the object-to-image ratio (2) in general, higher capacity models exhibit better generalization; (3) when knowing the approximate object sizes, adapting receptive field is beneficial; and (4) for very small signal-to-noise ratio the choice of global pooling operation affects optimization, whereas for relatively large signal-to-noise values, all tested global pooling operations exhibit similar performance.
10	One approach to deal with the statistical inefficiency of neural networks is to rely on auxiliary losses that help to build useful representations. However, it is not always trivial to know if an auxiliary task will be helpful for the main task and when it could start hurting. We propose to use the cosine similarity between gradients of tasks as an adaptive weight to detect when an auxiliary loss is helpful to the main loss. We show that our approach is guaranteed to converge to critical points of the main task and demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed algorithm in a few domains: multi-task supervised learning on subsets of ImageNet, reinforcement learning on gridworld, and reinforcement learning on Atari games.
01	Class labels have been empirically shown useful in improving the sample quality of generative adversarial nets (GANs). In this paper, we mathematically study the properties of the current variants of GANs that make use of class label information. With class aware gradient and cross-entropy decomposition, we reveal how class labels and associated losses influence GAN's training. Based on that, we propose Activation Maximization Generative Adversarial Networks (AM-GAN) as an advanced solution. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to validate our analysis and evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, where AM-GAN outperforms other strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art Inception Score (8.91) on CIFAR-10. In addition, we demonstrate that, with the Inception ImageNet classifier, Inception Score mainly tracks the diversity of the generator, and there is, however, no reliable evidence that it can reflect the true sample quality. We thus propose a new metric, called AM Score, to provide more accurate estimation on the sample quality. Our proposed model also outperforms the baseline methods in the new metric.
10	In this paper, we study deep diagonal circulant neural networks, that is deep neural networks in which weight matrices are the product of diagonal and circulant ones.Besides making a theoretical analysis of their expressivity, we introduced principled techniques for training these models: we devise an initialization scheme and proposed a smart use of non-linearity functions in order to train deep diagonal circulant networks. Furthermore, we show that these networks outperform recently introduced deep networks with other types of structured layers. We conduct a thorough experimental study to compare the performance of deep diagonal circulant networks with state of the art models based on structured matrices and with dense models. We show that our models achieve better accuracy than other structured approaches while required 2x fewer weights as the next best approach. Finally we train deep diagonal circulant networks to build a compact and accurate models on a real world video classification dataset with over 3.8 million training examples. 
10	Encoding images as a series of high-level constructs, such as brush strokes or discrete shapes, can often be key to both human and machine understanding. In many cases, however, data is only available in pixel form. We present a method for generating images directly in a high-level domain (e.g.  brush strokes), without the need for real pairwise data.  Specifically, we train a ”canvas” network to imitate the mapping of high-level constructs to pixels, followed by a high-level ”drawing” network which is optimized through this mapping towards solving a desired image recreation or translation task.  We successfully discover sequential vector representations of symbols,  large sketches,  and 3D objects,  utilizing only pixel data.  We display applications of our method in image segmentation, and present several ablation studies comparing various configurations.
10	Despite the remarkable development of recent deep learning techniques, neural networks are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., methods that fool the neural networks with perturbations that are too small for human eyes to perceive. Many adversarial training methods were introduced as to solve this problem, using adversarial examples as a training data. However, these adversarial attack methods used in these techniques are fixed, making the model stronger only to attacks used in training, which is widely known as an overfitting problem. In this paper, we suggest a novel adversarial training approach. In addition to the classifier, our method adds another neural network that generates the most effective adversarial perturbation by finding the weakness of the classifier. This perturbation generator network is trained to produce perturbations that maximize the loss function of the classifier, and these adversarial examples train the classifier with a true label. In short, the two networks compete with each other, performing a minimax game. In this scenario, attack patterns created by the generator network are adaptively altered to the classifier, mitigating the overfitting problem mentioned above. We theoretically proved that our minimax optimization problem is equivalent to minimizing the adversarial loss after all. Beyond this, we proposed an evaluation method that could accurately compare a wide-range of adversarial algorithms. Experiments with various datasets show that our method outperforms conventional adversarial algorithms. 
01	We propose a new sample-efficient methodology, called Supervised Policy Update (SPU), for deep reinforcement learning. Starting with data generated by the current policy, SPU formulates and solves a constrained optimization problem in the non-parameterized proximal policy space. Using supervised regression, it then converts the optimal non-parameterized policy to a parameterized policy, from which it draws new samples. The methodology is general in that it applies to both discrete and continuous action spaces, and can handle a wide variety of proximity constraints for the non-parameterized optimization problem. We show how the Natural Policy Gradient and Trust Region Policy Optimization (NPG/TRPO) problems, and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) problem can be addressed by this methodology. The SPU implementation is much simpler than TRPO. In terms of sample efficiency, our extensive experiments show SPU outperforms TRPO in Mujoco simulated robotic tasks and outperforms PPO in Atari video game tasks.
10	"Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) are finding increasingly widespread use in many application domains. Despite outstanding progress, quantitative evaluation of such models often involves multiple distinct metrics to assess different desirable properties, such as image quality, conditional consistency, and intra-conditioning diversity. In this setting, model benchmarking becomes a challenge, as each metric may indicate a different ""best"" model. In this paper, we propose the Frechet Joint Distance (FJD), which is defined as the Frechet distance between joint distributions of images and conditioning, allowing it to implicitly capture the aforementioned properties in a single metric. We conduct proof-of-concept experiments on a controllable synthetic dataset, which consistently highlight the benefits of FJD when compared to currently established metrics. Moreover, we use the newly introduced metric to compare existing cGAN-based models for a variety of conditioning modalities (e.g. class labels, object masks, bounding boxes, images, and text captions). We show that FJD can be used as a promising single metric for model benchmarking."
10	We argue that symmetry is an important consideration in addressing the problemof systematicity and investigate two forms of symmetry relevant to symbolic processes. We implement this approach in terms of convolution and show that it canbe used to achieve effective generalisation in three toy problems: rule learning,composition and grammar learning.
10	Efficient exploration is essential to reinforcement learning in huge state space. Recent approaches to address this issue include the intrinsically motivated goal exploration process (IMGEP) and the maximum state entropy exploration (MSEE). In this paper, we disclose that goal-conditioned exploration behaviors in IMGEP can also maximize the state entropy, which bridges the IMGEP and the MSEE. From this connection, we propose a maximum entropy criterion for goal selection in goal-conditioned exploration, which results in the new exploration method novelty-pursuit. Novelty-pursuit performs the exploration in two stages: first, it selects a goal for the goal-conditioned exploration policy to reach the boundary of the explored region; then, it takes random actions to explore the non-explored region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in environments from simple maze environments, Mujoco tasks, to the long-horizon video game of SuperMarioBros. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches that use curiosity-driven exploration.
10	The quest for increased visual recognition performance has led to the development of highly complex neural networks with very deep topologies. To avoid high computing resource requirements of such complex networks and to enable operation on devices with limited resources, this paper introduces adaptive kernels for convolutional layers. Motivated by the non-linear perception response in human visual cells, the input image is used to define the weights of a dynamic kernel called Adaptive kernel. This new adaptive kernel is used to perform a second convolution of the input image generating the output pixel. Adaptive kernels enable accurate recognition with lower memory requirements; This is accomplished through reducing the number of kernels and the number of layers needed in the typical CNN configuration, in addition to reducing the memory used, increasing 2X the training speed and the number of activation function evaluations. Our experiments show a reduction of 70X in the memory used for MNIST, maintaining 99% accuracy and 16X memory reduction for CIFAR10 with 92.5% accuracy.
10	The integration of a  Knowledge Base (KB) into a neural dialogue agent is one of the key challenges in Conversational AI. Memory networks has proven to be effective to encode KB information into an external memory to thus generate more fluent and informed responses. Unfortunately, such memory becomes full of latent representations during training, so the most common strategy is to overwrite old memory entries randomly. In this paper, we question this approach and provide experimental evidence showing that conventional memory networks generate many redundant latent vectors resulting in overfitting and the need for larger memories. We introduce memory dropout as an automatic technique that encourages diversity in the latent space by 1) Aging redundant memories to increase their probability of being overwritten during training 2) Sampling new memories that summarize the knowledge acquired by redundant memories. This technique allows us to incorporate  Knowledge Bases to achieve state-of-the-art dialogue generation in the Stanford Multi-Turn Dialogue dataset. Considering the same architecture, its use provides an improvement of +2.2 BLEU points for the automatic  generation of responses and an increase of +8.1% in the recognition of named entities.
10	We present a formal measure-theoretical theory of neural networks (NN) built on {\it probability coupling theory}. Particularly, we present an algorithm framework, Hierarchical Measure Group and Approximate System (HMGAS), nicknamed S-System, of which NNs are special cases. In addition to many other results, the framework enables us to prove that 1) NNs implement {\it renormalization group (RG)} using information geometry, which points out that the large scale property to renormalize is dual Bregman divergence and completes the analog between NNs and RG; 2) and under a set of {\it realistic} boundedness and diversity conditions, for {\it large size nonlinear deep} NNs with a class of losses, including the hinge loss, all local minima are global minima with zero loss errors, using random matrix theory.
10	This paper introduces a new method to discover mislabeled training samples and to mitigate their impact on the training process of deep networks. At the heart of our algorithm lies the Area Under the Loss (AUL) statistic, which can be easily computed for each sample in the training set. We show that the AUL can use training dynamics to differentiate between (clean) samples that benefit from generalization and (mislabeled) samples that need to be “memorized”. We demonstrate that the estimated AUL score conditioned on clean vs. noisy is approximately Gaussian distributed and can be well estimated with a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The resulting GMM provides us with mixing coefficients that reveal the percentage of mislabeled samples in a data set as well as probability estimates that each individual training sample is mislabeled. We show that these probability estimates can be used to down-weight suspicious training samples and successfully alleviate the damaging impact of label noise. We demonstrate on the CIFAR10/100 datasets that our proposed approach is significantly more accurate and consistent across model architectures than all prior work.
01	Weight decay is one of the standard tricks in the neural network toolbox, but the reasons for its regularization effect are poorly understood, and recent results have cast doubt on the traditional interpretation in terms of $L_2$ regularization.Literal weight decay has been shown to outperform $L_2$ regularization for optimizers for which they differ. We empirically investigate weight decay for three optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, and K-FAC) and a variety of network architectures. We identify three distinct mechanisms by which weight decay exerts a regularization effect, depending on the particular optimization algorithm and architecture: (1) increasing the effective learning rate, (2) approximately regularizing the input-output Jacobian norm, and (3) reducing the effective damping coefficient for second-order optimization. Our results provide insight into how to improve the regularization of neural networks.
01	Unsupervised anomaly detection on multi- or high-dimensional data is of great importance in both fundamental machine learning research and industrial applications, for which density estimation lies at the core. Although previous approaches based on dimensionality reduction followed by density estimation have made fruitful progress, they mainly suffer from decoupled model learning with inconsistent optimization goals and incapability of preserving essential information in the low-dimensional space. In this paper, we present a Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM) for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our model utilizes a deep autoencoder to generate a low-dimensional representation and reconstruction error for each input data point, which is further fed into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Instead of using decoupled two-stage training and the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, DAGMM jointly optimizes the parameters of the deep autoencoder and the mixture model simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion, leveraging a separate estimation network to facilitate the parameter learning of the mixture model. The joint optimization, which well balances autoencoding reconstruction, density estimation of latent representation, and regularization, helps the autoencoder escape from less attractive local optima and further reduce reconstruction errors, avoiding the need of pre-training. Experimental results on several public benchmark datasets show that, DAGMM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, and achieves up to 14% improvement based on the standard F1 score.
10	  The problem of adversarial examples has shown that modern Neural Network (NN) models could be rather fragile. Among the most promising techniques to solve the problem, one is to require the model to be {\it $\epsilon$-adversarially robust} (AR); that is, to require the model not to change predicted labels when any given input examples are perturbed within a certain range. However, it is widely observed that such methods would lead to standard performance degradation, i.e., the degradation on natural examples.  In this work, we study the degradation through the regularization perspective.  We identify quantities from generalization analysis of NNs; with the identified quantities we empirically find that AR is achieved by regularizing/biasing NNs towards less confident solutions by making the changes in the feature space (induced by changes in the instance space) of most layers smoother uniformly in all directions; so to a certain extent, it prevents sudden change in prediction w.r.t.  perturbations. However, the end result of such smoothing concentrates samples around decision boundaries, resulting in less confident solutions, and leads to worse standard performance.  Our studies suggest that one might consider ways that build AR into NNs in a gentler way to avoid the problematic regularization.
10	Value iteration networks are an approximation of the value iteration (VI) algorithm implemented with convolutional neural networks to make VI fully differentiable. In this work, we study these networks in the context of robot motion planning, with a focus on applications to planetary rovers. The key challenging task in learning-based motion planning is to learn a transformation from terrain observations to a suitable navigation reward function. In order to deal with complex terrain observations and policy learning, we propose a value iteration recurrence, referred to as the soft value iteration network (SVIN). SVIN is designed to produce more effective training gradients through the value iteration network. It relies on a soft policy model, where the policy is represented with a probability distribution over all possible actions, rather than a deterministic policy that returns only the best action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in robot motion planning scenarios. In particular, we study the application of SVIN to very challenging problems in planetary rover navigation and present early training results on data gathered by the  Curiosity rover that is currently operating on Mars.
10	The digitization of data has resulted in making datasets available to millions of users in the form of relational databases and spreadsheet tables. However, a majority of these users come from diverse backgrounds and lack the programming expertise to query and analyze such tables. We present a system that allows for querying data tables using natural language questions, where the system translates the question into an executable SQL query. We use a deep sequence to sequence model in wich the decoder uses a simple type system of SQL expressions to structure the output prediction. Based on the type, the decoder either copies an output token from the input question using an attention-based copying mechanism or generates it from a fixed vocabulary. We also introduce a value-based loss function that transforms a distribution over locations to copy from into a distribution over the set of input tokens to improve training of our model. We evaluate our model on the recently released WikiSQL dataset and show that our model trained using only supervised learning significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art Seq2SQL model that uses reinforcement learning.
10	We develop a new algorithm for imitation learning from a single expert demonstration. In contrast to many previous one-shot imitation learning approaches, our algorithm does not assume access to more than one expert demonstration during the training phase. Instead, we leverage an exploration policy to acquire unsupervised trajectories, which are then used to train both an encoder and a context-aware imitation policy. The optimization procedures for the encoder, imitation learner, and exploration policy are all tightly linked. This linking creates a feedback loop wherein the exploration policy collects new demonstrations that challenge the imitation learner, while the encoder attempts to help the imitation policy to the best of its abilities. We evaluate our algorithm on 6 MujoCo robotics tasks.
10	Deep learning models have achieved huge success in numerous fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, unlike such fields, it is hard to apply traditional deep learning models on the graph data due to the ‘node-orderless’ property. Normally, adjacency matrices will cast an artificial and random node-order on the graphs, which renders the performance of deep mod- els on graph classification tasks extremely erratic, and the representations learned by such models lack clear interpretability. To eliminate the unnecessary node- order constraint, we propose a novel model named Isomorphic Neural Network (ISONN), which learns the graph representation by extracting its isomorphic features via the graph matching between input graph and templates. ISONN has two main components: graph isomorphic feature extraction component and classification component. The graph isomorphic feature extraction component utilizes a set of subgraph templates as the kernel variables to learn the possible subgraph patterns existing in the input graph and then computes the isomorphic features. A set of permutation matrices is used in the component to break the node-order brought by the matrix representation. Three fully-connected layers are used as the classification component in ISONN. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, the experimental results can demonstrate the effectiveness of ISONN, especially compared with both classic and state-of-the-art graph classification methods.
10	This paper considers probability distributions of penultimate activations in deep classiﬁcation networks. We ﬁrst identify a dual relation between the activations and the weights of the ﬁnal fully connected layer: learning the networks with the cross-entropy loss makes their (normalized) penultimate activations follow a von Mises-Fisher distribution for each class, which is parameterized by the weights of the ﬁnal fully-connected layer. Through this analysis, we derive a probability density function of penultimate activations per class. This generative model allows us to synthesize activations of classiﬁcation networks without feeding images forward through them. We also demonstrate through experiments that our generative model of penultimate activations can be applied to real-world applications such as knowledge distillation and class-conditional image generation.
10	Supervised learning with irregularly sampled time series have been a challenge to Machine Learning methods due to the obstacle of dealing with irregular time intervals. Some papers introduced recently recurrent neural network models that deals with irregularity, but most of them rely on complex mechanisms to achieve a better performance. This work propose a novel method to represent timestamps (hours or dates) as dense vectors using sinusoidal functions, called Time Embeddings. As a data input method it and can be applied to most machine learning models. The method was evaluated with two predictive tasks from MIMIC III, a dataset of irregularly sampled time series of electronic health records. Our tests showed an improvement to LSTM-based and classical machine learning models, specially with very irregular data.
01	 Recent breakthroughs of pretrained language models have shown the effectiveness of self-supervised learning for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In addition to standard syntactic and semantic NLP tasks, pretrained models achieve strong improvements on tasks that involve real-world knowledge, suggesting that large-scale language modeling could be an implicit method to capture knowledge. In this work, we further investigate the extent to which pretrained models such as BERT capture knowledge using a zero-shot fact completion task. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective weakly supervised pretraining objective, which explicitly forces the model to incorporate knowledge about real-world entities. Models trained with our new objective yield significant improvements on the fact completion task. When applied to downstream tasks, our model consistently outperforms BERT on four entity-related question answering datasets (i.e., WebQuestions, TriviaQA, SearchQA and Quasar-T) with an average 2.7 F1 improvements and a standard fine-grained entity typing dataset (i.e., FIGER) with 5.7 accuracy gains.
10	Adversarial examples remain an issue for contemporary neural networks. This paper draws on Background Check (Perello-Nieto et al., 2016), a technique in model calibration, to assist two-class neural networks in detecting adversarial examples, using the one dimensional difference between logit values as the underlying measure. This method interestingly tends to achieve the highest average recall on image sets that are generated with large perturbation vectors, which is unlike the existing literature on adversarial attacks (Cubuk et al., 2017). The proposed method does not need knowledge of the attack parameters or methods at training time, unlike a great deal of the literature that uses deep learning based methods to detect adversarial examples, such as Metzen et al. (2017), imbuing the proposed method with additional flexibility.
01	In this paper we approach two relevant deep learning topics: i) tackling of graph structured input data and ii) a better understanding and analysis of deep networks and related learning algorithms. With this in mind we focus on the topological classification of reachability in a particular subset of planar graphs (Mazes). Doing so, we are able to model the topology of data while staying in Euclidean space, thus allowing its processing with standard CNN architectures. We suggest a suitable architecture for this problem and show that it can express a perfect solution to the classification task. The shape of the cost function around this solution is also derived and, remarkably, does not depend on the size of the maze in the large maze limit. Responsible for this behavior are rare events in the dataset which strongly regulate the shape of the cost function near this global minimum. We further identify an obstacle to learning in the form of poorly performing local minima in which the network chooses to ignore some of the inputs. We further support our claims with training experiments and numerical analysis of the cost function on networks with up to $128$ layers.
10	We consider the problem of information compression from high dimensional data. Where many studies consider the problem of compression by non-invertible trans- formations, we emphasize the importance of invertible compression. We introduce new class of likelihood-based auto encoders with pseudo bijective architecture, which we call Pseudo Invertible Encoders. We provide the theoretical explanation of their principles. We evaluate Gaussian Pseudo Invertible Encoder on MNIST, where our model outperform WAE and VAE in sharpness of the generated images.
10	Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has shown the potential to solve traditional NP-hard problems recently. Previous studies have shown that NCO outperforms heuristic algorithms in many combinatorial optimization problems such as the routing problems. However, it is less efficient for more complicated problems such as packing, one type of optimization problem that  faces mutual conditioned action space. In this paper, we propose a Conditional Query Learning (CQL) method to handle the packing problem for both 2D and 3D settings. By embedding previous actions as a conditional query to the attention model, we design a fully end-to-end model and train it for 2D and 3D packing via reinforcement learning respectively. Through extensive experiments, the results show that our method could achieve lower bin gap ratio and variance for both 2D and 3D packing. Our model improves 7.2% space utilization ratio compared with genetic algorithm for 3D packing (30 boxes case), and reduces more than 10% bin gap ratio in almost every case compared with extant learning approaches. In addition, our model shows great scalability to packing box number. Furthermore, we provide a general test environment of 2D and 3D packing for learning algorithms. All source code of the model and the test environment is released.
10	A significant body of recent work has examined variational autoencoders as a powerful approach for tasks which involve modeling the distribution of complex data such as images and text. In this work, we present a framework for modeling multiple data sets which come from differing distributions but which share some common latent structure. By incorporating architectural constraints and using a mutual information regularized form of the variational objective, our method successfully models differing data populations while explicitly encouraging the isolation of the shared and private latent factors. This enables our model to learn useful shared structure across similar tasks and to disentangle cross-population representations in a weakly supervised way. We demonstrate the utility of our method on several applications including image denoising, sub-group discovery, and continual learning.
01	Control of complex systems involves both system identification and controller design. Deep neural networks have proven to be successful in many identification tasks, however, from model-based control perspective, these networks are difficult to work with because they are typically nonlinear and nonconvex. Therefore many systems are still identified and controlled based on simple linear models despite their poor representation capability.In this paper we bridge the gap between model accuracy and control tractability faced by neural networks, by explicitly constructing networks that are convex with respect to their inputs. We show that these input convex networks can be trained to obtain accurate models of complex physical systems. In particular, we design input convex recurrent neural networks to capture temporal behavior of dynamical systems. Then optimal controllers can be achieved via solving a convex model predictive control problem. Experiment results demonstrate the good potential of the proposed input convex neural network based approach in a variety of control applications. In particular we show that in the MuJoCo locomotion tasks, we could achieve over 10% higher performance using 5 times less time compared with state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning method; and in the building HVAC control example, our method achieved up to 20% energy reduction compared with classic linear models.
10	We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning approach to hierarchical text classification where documents are labeled by placing them at the right positions in a given hierarchy.While existing “global” methods construct hierarchical losses for model training, they either make “local” decisions at each hierarchy node or ignore the hierarchy structure during inference. To close the gap between training/inference and optimize holistic metrics in an end-to-end manner, we propose to learn a label assignment policy to determine where to place the documents and when to stop. The proposed method, HiLAP, optimizes holistic metrics over the hierarchy, makes inter-dependent decisions during inference, and can be combined with different text encoding models for end-to-end training.Experiments on three public datasets show that HiLAP yields an average improvement of 33.4% in Macro-F1 and 5.0% in Samples-F1, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.
10	When autonomous agents interact in the same environment, they must often cooperate to achieve their goals. One way for agents to cooperate effectively is to form a team, make a binding agreement on a joint plan, and execute it. However, when agents are self-interested, the gains from team formation must be allocated appropriately to incentivize agreement. Various approaches for multi-agent negotiation have been proposed, but typically only work for particular negotiation protocols. More general methods usually require human input or domain-specific data, and so do not scale. To address this, we propose a framework for training agents to negotiate and form teams using deep reinforcement learning. Importantly, our method makes no assumptions about the specific negotiation protocol, and is instead completely experience driven. We evaluate our approach on both non-spatial and spatially extended team-formation negotiation environments, demonstrating that our agents beat hand-crafted bots and reach negotiation outcomes consistent with fair solutions predicted by cooperative game theory. Additionally, we investigate how the physical location of agents influences negotiation outcomes.
10	Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method for reducing the computational over-head of deep network inference, in which the output of a teacher model is used to traina smaller, faster student model. Hint training (i.e., FitNets) extends KD by regressing astudent model’s intermediate representation to a teacher model’s intermediate representa-tion. In this work, we introduce bLock-wise Intermediate representation Training (LIT),a novel model compression technique that extends the use of intermediate represen-tations in deep network compression, outperforming KD and hint training. LIT has twokey ideas: 1) LIT trains a student of the same width (but shallower depth) as the teacherby directly comparing the intermediate representations, and 2) LIT uses the intermediaterepresentation from the previous block in the teacher model as an input to the current stu-dent block during training, avoiding unstable intermediate representations in the studentnetwork. We show that LIT provides substantial reductions in network depth withoutloss in accuracy — for example, LIT can compress a ResNeXt-110 to a ResNeXt-20(5.5×) on CIFAR10 and a VDCNN-29 to a VDCNN-9 (3.2×) on Amazon Reviewswithout loss in accuracy, outperforming KD and hint training in network size at a givenaccuracy. We also show that applying LIT to identical student/teacher architecturesincreases the accuracy of the student model above the teacher model, outperforming therecently-proposed Born Again Networks procedure on ResNet, ResNeXt, and VDCNN.Finally, we show that LIT can effectively compress GAN generators.
10	Nowadays, machine learning models are becoming a utility in many sectors. AI companies deliver pre-trained encapsulated models as application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers can combine with third party components, their models, and proprietary data, to create complex data products. This complexity and the lack of control and knowledge of the internals of these external components might cause unavoidable effects, such as lack of transparency, difficulty in auditability, and the emergence of uncontrolled potential risks. These issues are especially critical when practitioners use these components as black-boxes in new datasets. In order to provide actionable insights in this type of scenarios, in this work we propose the use of a wrapping deep learning model to enrich the output of a classification black-box with a measure of uncertainty. Given a black-box classifier, we propose a probabilistic neural network that works in parallel to the black-box and uses a Dirichlet layer as the fusion layer with the black-box.  This Dirichlet layer yields a distribution on top of the multinomial output parameters of the classifier and enables the estimation of aleatoric uncertainty for any data sample.  Based on the resulting uncertainty measure, we advocate for a rejection system that selects the more confident predictions, discarding those more uncertain, leading to an improvement in the trustability of the resulting system. We showcase the proposed technique and methodology in two practical scenarios, one for NLP and another for computer vision, where a simulated API based is applied to different domains. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the uncertainty computed by the wrapper and its high correlation to wrong predictions and misclassifications.
01	This paper proposes a class of well-conditioned neural networks in which a unit amount of change in the inputs causes at most a unit amount of change in the outputs or any of the internal layers. We develop the known methodology of controlling Lipschitz constants to realize its full potential in maximizing robustness, with a new regularization scheme for linear layers, new ways to adapt nonlinearities and a new loss function. With MNIST and CIFAR-10 classifiers, we demonstrate a number of advantages. Without needing any adversarial training, the proposed classifiers exceed the state of the art in robustness against white-box L2-bounded adversarial attacks. They generalize better than ordinary networks from noisy data with partially random labels. Their outputs are quantitatively meaningful and indicate levels of confidence and generalization, among other desirable properties.
10	This paper makes two contributions towards understanding how the hyperparameters of stochastic gradient descent affect the final training loss and test accuracy of neural networks. First, we argue that stochastic gradient descent exhibits two regimes with different behaviours; a noise dominated regime which typically arises for small or moderate batch sizes, and a curvature dominated regime which typically arises when the batch size is large. In the noise dominated regime, the optimal learning rate increases as the batch size rises, and the training loss and test accuracy are independent of batch size under a constant epoch budget. In the curvature dominated regime, the optimal learning rate is independent of batch size, and the training loss and test accuracy degrade as the batch size rises. We support these claims with experiments on a range of architectures including ResNets, LSTMs and autoencoders. We always perform a grid search over learning rates at all batch sizes. Second, we demonstrate that small or moderately large batch sizes continue to outperform very large batches on the test set, even when both models are trained for the same number of steps and reach similar training losses. Furthermore, when training Wide-ResNets on CIFAR-10 with a constant batch size of 64, the optimal learning rate to maximize the test accuracy only decays by a factor of 2 when the epoch budget is increased by a factor of 128, while the optimal learning rate to minimize the training loss decays by a factor of 16. These results confirm that the noise in stochastic gradients can introduce beneficial implicit regularization.
10	A large number of natural language processing tasks exist to analyze syntax, semantics, and information content of human language. These seemingly very different tasks are usually solved by specially designed architectures. In this paper, we provide the simple insight that a great variety of tasks can be represented in a single unified format consisting of labeling spans and relations between spans, thus a single task-independent model can be used across different tasks. We perform extensive experiments to test this insight on 10 disparate tasks as broad as dependency parsing (syntax), semantic role labeling (semantics), relation extraction (information content), aspect based sentiment analysis (sentiment), and many others, achieving comparable performance as state-of-the-art specialized models. We further demonstrate benefits in multi-task learning. We convert these datasets into a unified format to build a benchmark, which provides a holistic testbed for evaluating future models for generalized natural language analysis.
10	This paper presents two methods to disentangle and interpret contextual effects that are encoded in a pre-trained deep neural network. Unlike convolutional studies that visualize image appearances corresponding to the network output or a neural activation from a global perspective, our research aims to clarify how a certain input unit (dimension) collaborates with other units (dimensions) to constitute inference patterns of the neural network and thus contribute to the network output. The analysis of local contextual effects w.r.t. certain input units is of special values in real applications. In particular, we used our methods to explain the gaming strategy of the alphaGo Zero model in experiments, and our method successfully disentangled the rationale of each move during the game.
10	Measuring Mutual Information (MI) between high-dimensional, continuous, random variables from observed samples has wide theoretical and practical applications. Recent works have developed accurate MI estimators through provably low-bias approximations and tight variational lower bounds assuming abundant supply of samples, but require an unrealistic number of samples to guarantee statistical significance of the estimation. In this work, we focus on improving data efficiency and propose a Data-Efficient MINE Estimator (DEMINE) that can provide a tight lower confident interval of MI under limited data, through adding cross-validation to the MINE lower bound (Belghazi et al., 2018). Hyperparameter search is employed and a novel meta-learning approach with task augmentation is developed to increase robustness to hyperparamters, reduce overfitting and improve accuracy. With improved data-efficiency, our DEMINE estimator enables statistical testing of dependency at practical dataset sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DEMINE on synthetic benchmarks and a real world fMRI dataset, with application of inter-subject correlation analysis.
10	"Image segmentation aims at grouping pixels that belong to the same object or region. At the heart of image segmentation lies the problem of determining whether a pixel is inside or outside a region, which we denote as the ""insideness"" problem. Many Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) variants excel in segmentation benchmarks, but regarding insideness, they have not been well visualized or understood: What representations do DNNs use to address the long-range relationships of insideness? How do architectural choices affect the learning of these representations? In this paper, we take the reductionist approach by analyzing DNNs solving the insideness problem in isolation, i.e. determining the inside of closed (Jordan) curves. We demonstrate analytically that state-of-the-art feed-forward and recurrent architectures can implement solutions of the insideness problem for any given curve. Yet, only recurrent networks could  learn these general solutions when the training enforced a specific ""routine"" capable of breaking down the long-range relationships. Our results highlights the need for new training strategies that decompose the learning into appropriate stages, and that lead to the general class of solutions necessary for DNNs to understand insideness."
10	Imitation learning can reproduce policies by observing experts, which poses a problem regarding policy propriety. Policies, such as human, or policies on deployed robots, can all be cloned without consent from the owners. How can we protect our proprietary policies from cloning by an external observer? To answer this question we introduce a new reinforcement learning framework, where we train an ensemble of optimal policies, whose demonstrations are guaranteed to be useless for an external observer. We formulate this idea by a constrained optimization problem, where the objective is to improve proprietary policies, and at the same time deteriorate the virtual policy of an eventual external observer. We design a tractable algorithm to solve this new optimization problem by modifying the standard policy gradient algorithm. It appears such problem formulation admits plausible interpretations of confidentiality, adversarial behaviour, which enables a broader perspective of this work. We demonstrate explicitly the existence of such 'non-clonable' ensembles, providing a solution to the above optimization problem, which is calculated by our modified policy gradient algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first work regarding the protection and privacy of policies in Reinforcement Learning.
10	Automatically feature generation is a major topic of automated machine learning. Among various feature generation approaches, feature crossing, which takes cross-product of sparse features, is a promising way to effectively capture the interactions among categorical features in tabular data. Previous works on feature crossing try to search in the set of all the possible cross feature fields. This is obviously not efficient when the size of original feature fields is large. Meanwhile, some deep learning-based methods combines deep neural networks and various interaction components. However, due to the existing of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), only a few cross features can be explicitly generated by the interaction components. Recently, piece-wise interpretation of DNN has been widely studied, and the piece-wise interpretations are usually inconsistent in different samples. Inspired by this, we give a definition of interpretation inconsistency in DNN, and propose a novel method called CrossGO, which selects useful cross features according to the interpretation inconsistency. The whole process of learning feature crossing can be done via simply training a DNN model and a logistic regression (LR) model. CrossGO can generate compact candidate set of cross feature fields, and promote the efficiency of searching. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several real-world datasets. Cross features generated by CrossGO can empower a simple LR model achieving approximate or even better performances comparing with complex DNN models.
10	Minimum hyperspherical energy (MHE) has demonstrated its potential in regularizing neural networks and improving the generalization. MHE was inspired by the Thomson problem in physics where the distribution of multiple propelling electrons on a unit sphere can be modeled via minimizing some potential energy. Despite its practical effectiveness, MHE suffers from some difficulties in optimization as the dimensionality of the space becomes higher, therefore limiting the potential to improve network generalization. To address these problems, we propose the compressive minimum hyperspherical energy (CoMHE) as a more effective regularization for neural networks. Specifically, CoMHE utilizes a projection mapping to reduce the dimensionality of neurons and minimizes their hyperspherical energy. According to different constructions for the projection mapping, we propose two major variants: random projection CoMHE and angle-preserving CoMHE. As a novel extension, We further consider adversarial projection CoMHE and group CoMHE. We also provide some theoretical insights to justify the effectiveness. Our comprehensive experiments show that CoMHE consistently outperforms MHE by a considerable margin, and can be easily applied to improve different tasks such as image recognition and point cloud recognition.
01	Our understanding of reinforcement learning (RL) has been shaped by theoretical and empirical results that were obtained decades ago using tabular representations and linear function approximators. These results suggest that RL methods that use temporal differencing (TD) are superior to direct Monte Carlo estimation (MC). How do these results hold up in deep RL, which deals with perceptually complex environments and deep nonlinear models? In this paper, we re-examine the role of TD in modern deep RL, using specially designed environments that control for specific factors that affect performance, such as reward sparsity, reward delay, and the perceptual complexity of the task. When comparing TD with infinite-horizon MC, we are able to reproduce classic results in modern settings. Yet we also find that finite-horizon MC is not inferior to TD, even when rewards are sparse or delayed. This makes MC a viable alternative to TD in deep RL.
01	Stochastic AUC maximization has garnered an increasing interest due to better fit to imbalanced data classification. However, existing works are limited to stochastic AUC maximization with a linear predictive model, which restricts its predictive power when dealing with extremely complex data. In this paper, we consider stochastic AUC maximization problem with a deep neural network as the predictive model. Building on the saddle point reformulation of a surrogated loss of AUC, the problem can be cast into a {\it non-convex concave} min-max problem. The main contribution made in this paper is to make stochastic AUC maximization more practical for deep neural networks and big data with theoretical insights as well. In particular, we propose to explore Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) condition that has been proved and observed in deep learning, which enables us to develop new stochastic algorithms with even faster convergence rate and more practical step size scheme. An AdaGrad-style algorithm is also analyzed under the PL condition with adaptive convergence rate. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
10	Reliably transmitting messages despite information loss due to a noisy channel is a core problem of information theory.  One of the most important aspects of real world communication is that it may happen at varying levels of information transfer. The bandwidth-limited channel models this phenomenon.  In this study we consider learning joint coding with the bandwidth-limited channel.  Although, classical results suggest that it is asymptotically optimal to separate the sub-tasks of compression (source coding) and error correction (channel coding), it is well known that for finite block-length problems, and when there are restrictions to the computational complexity of coding, this optimality may not be achieved. Thus, we empirically compare the performance of joint and separate systems, and conclude that joint systems outperform their separate counterparts when coding is performed by flexible learnable function approximators such as neural networks.  Specifically, we cast the joint communication problem as a variational learning problem. To facilitate this, we introduce a differentiable and computationally efficient version of this channel.  We show that our design compensates for the loss of information by two mechanisms: (i) missing information is modelled by a prior model incorporated in the channel model, and (ii) sampling from the joint model is improved by auxiliary latent variables in the decoder. Experimental results justify the validity of our design decisions through improved distortion and FID scores.
01	In this paper, we conduct an intriguing experimental study about the physical adversarial attack on object detectors in the wild. In particular, we learn a camouflage pattern to hide vehicles from being detected by state-of-the-art convolutional neural network based detectors. Our approach alternates between two threads. In the first, we train a neural approximation function to imitate how a simulator applies a camouflage to vehicles and how a vehicle detector performs given images of the camouflaged vehicles. In the second, we minimize the approximated detection score by searching for the optimal camouflage. Experiments show that the learned camouflage can not only hide a vehicle from the image-based detectors under many test cases but also generalizes to different environments, vehicles, and object detectors.
10	We present a new methodology that constructs a family of \emph{positive definite kernels} from any given dissimilarity measure on structured inputs whose elements are either real-valued time series or discrete structures such as strings, histograms, and graphs. Our approach, which we call D2KE (from Distance to Kernel and Embedding), draws from the literature of Random Features.However, instead of deriving random feature maps from a user-defined kernel to approximate kernel machines, we build a kernel from a random feature map, that we specify given the distance measure. We further propose use of a finite number of random objects to produce a random feature embedding of each instance.We provide a theoretical analysis showing that D2KE enjoys better generalizability than universal Nearest-Neighbor estimates. On one hand, D2KE subsumes the widely-used \emph{representative-set method} as a special case, and relates to the well-known \emph{distance substitution kernel} in a limiting case. On the other hand, D2KE generalizes existing \emph{Random Features methods} applicable only to vector input representations to complex structured inputs of variable sizes. We conduct classification experiments over such disparate domains as time series, strings, and histograms (for texts and images), for which our proposed framework compares favorably to existing distance-based learning methods in terms of both testing accuracy and computational time.
10	This work examines batch reinforcement learning--the task of maximally exploiting a given batch of off-policy data, without further data collection. We demonstrate that due to errors introduced by extrapolation, standard off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms, such as DQN and DDPG, are only capable of learning with data correlated to their current policy, making them ineffective for most off-policy applications. We introduce a novel class of off-policy algorithms, batch-constrained reinforcement learning, which restricts the action space to force the agent towards behaving on-policy with respect to a subset of the given data. We extend this notion to deep reinforcement learning, and to the best of our knowledge, present the first continuous control deep reinforcement learning algorithm which can learn effectively from uncorrelated off-policy data.
01	Recent progress in variational inference has paid much attention to the flexibility of variational posteriors. One promising direction is to use implicit distributions, i.e., distributions without tractable densities as the variational posterior. However, existing methods on implicit posteriors still face challenges of noisy estimation and computational infeasibility when applied to models with high-dimensional latent variables. In this paper, we present a new approach named Kernel Implicit Variational Inference that addresses these challenges. As far as we know, for the first time implicit variational inference is successfully applied to Bayesian neural networks, which shows promising results on both regression and classification tasks.
10	Capturing spatiotemporal dynamics is an essential topic in video recognition. In this paper, we present learnable higher-order operation as a generic family of building blocks for capturing higher-order correlations from high dimensional input video space. We prove that several successful architectures for visual classification tasks are in the family of higher-order neural networks, theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates their underlying mechanism is higher-order.  On the task of video recognition, even using RGB only without fine-tuning with other video datasets, our higher-order models can achieve results on par with or better than the existing state-of-the-art methods on both Something-Something (V1 and V2) and Charades datasets.
01	The adversarial training procedure proposed by Madry et al. (2018) is one of the most effective methods to defend against adversarial examples in deep neural net- works (DNNs). In our paper, we shed some lights on the practicality and the hardness of adversarial training by showing that the effectiveness (robustness on test set) of adversarial training has a strong correlation with the distance between a test point and the manifold of training data embedded by the network. Test examples that are relatively far away from this manifold are more likely to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Consequentially, an adversarial training based defense is susceptible to a new class of attacks, the “blind-spot attack”, where the input images reside in “blind-spots” (low density regions) of the empirical distri- bution of training data but is still on the ground-truth data manifold. For MNIST, we found that these blind-spots can be easily found by simply scaling and shifting image pixel values. Most importantly, for large datasets with high dimensional and complex data manifold (CIFAR, ImageNet, etc), the existence of blind-spots in adversarial training makes defending on any valid test examples difficult due to the curse of dimensionality and the scarcity of training data. Additionally, we find that blind-spots also exist on provable defenses including (Kolter & Wong, 2018) and (Sinha et al., 2018) because these trainable robustness certificates can only be practically optimized on a limited set of training data.
10	Words in natural language follow a Zipfian distribution whereby some words are frequent but most are rare. Learning representations for words in the ``long tail'' of this distribution requires enormous amounts of data. Representations of rare words trained directly on end tasks are usually poor, requiring us to pre-train embeddings on external data, or treat all rare words as out-of-vocabulary words with a unique representation. We provide a method for predicting embeddings of rare words on the fly from small amounts of auxiliary data with a network trained end-to-end for the downstream task. We show that this improves results against baselines where embeddings are trained on the end task for reading comprehension, recognizing textual entailment and language modeling.
01	Recurrent neural networks have achieved excellent performance in many applications. However, on portable devices with limited resources, the models are often too large to deploy. For applications on the server with large scale concurrent requests, the latency during inference can also be very critical for costly computing resources. In this work, we address these problems by quantizing the network, both weights and activations, into multiple binary codes {-1,+1}. We formulate the quantization as an optimization problem. Under the key observation that once the quantization coefficients are fixed the binary codes can be derived efficiently by binary search tree, alternating minimization is then applied.  We test the quantization for two well-known RNNs, i.e., long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), on the language models. Compared with the full-precision counter part, by 2-bit quantization we can achieve ~16x memory saving and  ~6x real inference acceleration on CPUs, with only a reasonable loss in the accuracy. By 3-bit quantization, we can achieve almost no loss in the accuracy or even surpass the original model, with ~10.5x memory saving and ~3x real inference acceleration. Both results beat the exiting quantization works with large margins.  We extend our alternating quantization to image classification tasks. In both RNNs and feedforward neural networks, the method also achieves  excellent performance.
10	Machine learning systems often encounter Out-of-Distribution (OoD) errors when dealing with testing data coming from a different distribution from the one used for training. With their growing use in critical applications, it becomes important to develop systems that are able to accurately quantify its predictive uncertainty and screen out these anomalous inputs. However, unlike standard learning tasks, there is currently no well established guiding principle for designing architectures that can accurately quantify uncertainty. Moreover, commonly used OoD detection approaches are prone to errors and even sometimes assign higher likelihoods to OoD samples. To address these problems, we first seek to identify guiding principles for designing uncertainty-aware architectures, by proposing Neural Architecture Distribution Search (NADS). Unlike standard neural architecture search methods which seek for a single best performing architecture, NADS searches for a distribution of architectures that perform well on a given task, allowing us to identify building blocks common among all uncertainty aware architectures. With this formulation, we are able to optimize a stochastic outlier detection objective and construct an ensemble of models to perform OoD detection. We perform multiple OoD detection experiments and observe that our NADS performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art OoD detection methods.
01	"Adversarial training is one of the main defenses against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous study on diagnosing elements of large-scale adversarial training on ImageNet, which reveals two intriguing properties. First, we study the role of normalization. Batch normalization (BN) is a crucial element for achieving state-of-the-art performance on many vision tasks, but we show it may prevent networks from obtaining strong robustness in adversarial training. One unexpected observation is that, for models trained with BN, simply removing clean images from training data largely boosts adversarial robustness, i.e., 18.3%. We relate this phenomenon to the hypothesis that clean images and adversarial images are drawn from two different domains. This two-domain hypothesis may explain the issue of BN when training with a mixture of clean and adversarial images, as estimating normalization statistics of this mixture distribution is challenging. Guided by this two-domain hypothesis, we show disentangling the mixture distribution for normalization, i.e., applying separate BNs to clean and adversarial images for statistics estimation, achieves much stronger robustness. Additionally, we find that enforcing BNs to behave consistently at training and testing can further enhance robustness.Second, we study the role of network capacity. We find our so-called ""deep"" networks are still shallow for the task of adversarial learning. Unlike traditional classification tasks where accuracy is only marginally improved by adding more layers to ""deep"" networks (e.g., ResNet-152), adversarial training exhibits a much stronger demand on deeper networks to achieve higher adversarial robustness. This robustness improvement can be observed substantially and consistently even by pushing the network capacity to an unprecedented scale, i.e., ResNet-638.  "
10	We target the problem of finding a local minimum in non-convex finite-sum minimization. Towards this goal, we first prove that the trust region method with inexact gradient and Hessian estimation can achieve a convergence rate of order $\mathcal{O}({1}/{k^{2/3}})$ as long as those differential estimations are sufficiently accurate.Combining such result with a novel Hessian estimator, we propose a sample-efficient stochastic trust region (STR) algorithm which finds an $(\epsilon, \sqrt{\epsilon})$-approximate local minimum within $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({\sqrt{n}}/{\epsilon^{1.5}})$ stochastic Hessian oracle queries. This improves the state-of-the-art result by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1/6})$. Finally,  we also develop Hessian-free STR algorithms which achieve the lowest runtime complexity. Experiments verify theoretical conclusions and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
01	A generally intelligent learner should generalize to more complex tasks than it has previously encountered, but the two common paradigms in machine learning -- either training a separate learner per task or training a single learner for all tasks -- both have difficulty with such generalization because they do not leverage  the compositional structure of the task distribution. This paper introduces the compositional problem graph as a broadly applicable formalism to relate tasks of different complexity in terms of problems with shared subproblems. We propose the compositional generalization problem for measuring how readily old knowledge can be reused and hence built upon. As a first step for tackling compositional generalization, we introduce the compositional recursive learner, a domain-general framework for learning algorithmic procedures for composing representation transformations, producing a learner that reasons about what computation to execute by making analogies to previously seen problems. We show on a symbolic and a high-dimensional domain that our compositional approach can generalize to more complex problems than the learner has previously encountered, whereas baselines that are not explicitly compositional do not.
10	Deep neural networks were shown to be vulnerable to crafted adversarial perturbations, and thus bring serious safety problems. To solve this problem, we proposed $\text{AE-GAN}_\text{+sr}$, a framework for purifying input images by searching a closest natural reconstruction with little computation. We first build a reconstruction network AE-GAN, which adapted auto-encoder by introducing adversarial loss to the objective function. In this way, we can enhance the generative ability of decoder and preserve the abstraction ability of encoder to form a self-organized latent space. In the inference time, when given an input, we will start a search process in the latent space which aims to find the closest reconstruction to the given image on the distribution of normal data. The encoder can provide a good start point for the searching process, which saves much computation cost. Experiments show that our method is robust against various attacks and can reach comparable even better performance to similar methods with much fewer computations.
10	For the challenging semantic image segmentation task the best performing modelshave traditionally combined the structured modelling capabilities of ConditionalRandom Fields (CRFs) with the feature extraction power of CNNs. In more recentworks however, CRF post-processing has fallen out of favour. We argue that thisis mainly due to the slow training and inference speeds of CRFs, as well as thedifficulty of learning the internal CRF parameters. To overcome both issues wepropose to add the assumption of conditional independence to the framework offully-connected CRFs. This allows us to reformulate the inference in terms ofconvolutions, which can be implemented highly efficiently on GPUs.Doing sospeeds up inference and training by two orders of magnitude. All parameters ofthe convolutional CRFs can easily be optimized using backpropagation. Towardsthe goal of facilitating further CRF research we have made our implementationspublicly available.
01	With the proliferation of specialized neural network processors that operate on low-precision integers, the performance of Deep Neural Network inference becomes increasingly dependent on the result of quantization. Despite plenty of prior work on the quantization of weights or activations for neural networks, there is still a wide gap between the software quantizers and the low-precision accelerator implementation, which degrades either the efficiency of networks or that of the hardware for the lack of software and hardware coordination at design-phase. In this paper, we propose a learned linear symmetric quantizer for integer neural network processors, which not only quantizes neural parameters and activations to low-bit integer but also accelerates hardware inference by using batch normalization fusion and low-precision accumulators (e.g., 16-bit) and multipliers (e.g., 4-bit). We use a unified way to quantize weights and activations, and the results outperform many previous approaches for various networks such as AlexNet, ResNet, and lightweight models like MobileNet while keeping friendly to the accelerator architecture. Additional, we also apply the method to object detection models and witness high performance and accuracy in YOLO-v2. Finally, we deploy the quantized models on our specialized integer-arithmetic-only DNN accelerator to show the effectiveness of the proposed quantizer. We show that even with linear symmetric quantization, the results can be better than asymmetric or non-linear methods in 4-bit networks. In evaluation, the proposed quantizer induces less than 0.4\% accuracy drop in ResNet18, ResNet34, and AlexNet when quantizing the whole network as required by the integer processors.
10	"Modern neural network architectures often generalize well despite containing many more parameters than the size of the training dataset. This paper explores the generalization capabilities of neural networks trained via gradient descent. We develop a data-dependent optimization and generalization theory which leverages the low-rank structure of the Jacobian matrix associated with the network. Our results help demystify why training and generalization is easier on clean and structured datasets and harder on noisy and unstructured datasets as well as how the network size affects the evolution of the train and test errors during training. Specifically, we use a control knob to split the Jacobian spectum into ``information"" and ``nuisance"" spaces associated with the large and small singular values. We show that over the information space learning is fast and one can quickly train a model with zero training loss that can also generalize well. Over the nuisance space training is slower and early stopping can help with generalization at the expense of some bias. We also show that the overall generalization capability of the network is controlled by how well the labels are aligned with the information space. A key feature of our results is that even constant width neural nets can provably generalize for sufficiently nice datasets. We conduct various numerical experiments on deep networks that corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that: (i) the Jacobian of typical neural networks exhibit low-rank structure with a few large singular values and many small ones leading to a low-dimensional information space, (ii) over the information space learning is fast and most of the labels falls on this space, and (iii) label noise falls on the nuisance space and impedes optimization/generalization."
10	We explore some mathematical features of the loss landscape of overparameterized neural networks.  A priori one might imagine that the loss function looks like a typical function from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$ - in particular, nonconvex, with discrete global minima.  In this paper, we prove that in at least one important way, the loss function of an overparameterized neural network does not look like a typical function.  If a neural net has $n$ parameters and is trained on $d$ data points, with $n>d$, we show that the locus $M$ of global minima of $L$ is usually not discrete, but rather an $n-d$ dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  In practice, neural nets commonly have orders of magnitude more parameters than data points, so this observation implies that $M$ is typically a very high-dimensional subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
10	Artificial neural networks have revolutionized many areas of computer science in recent years, providing solutions to a number of previously unsolved problems.On the other hand, for many problems, classic algorithms exist, which typically exceed the accuracy and stability of neural networks.To combine these two concepts, we present a new kind of neural networks—algorithmic neural networks (AlgoNets).These networks integrate smooth versions of classic algorithms into the topology of neural networks.A forward AlgoNet includes algorithmic layers into existing architectures to enhance performance and explainability while a backward AlgoNet enables solving inverse problems without or with only weak supervision.In addition, we present the algonet package, a PyTorch based library that includes, inter alia, a smoothly evaluated programming language, a smooth 3D mesh renderer, and smooth sorting algorithms.
10	Data augmentation techniques, e.g., flipping or cropping, which systematically enlarge the training dataset by explicitly generating more training samples, are effective in improving the generalization performance of deep neural networks. In the supervised setting, a common practice for data augmentation is to assign the same label to all augmented samples of the same source. However, if the augmentation results in large distributional discrepancy among them (e.g., rotations), forcing their label invariance may be too difficult to solve and often hurts the performance. To tackle this challenge, we suggest a simple yet effective idea of learning the joint distribution of the original and self-supervised labels of augmented samples. The joint learning framework is easier to train, and enables an aggregated inference combining the predictions from different augmented samples for improving the performance. Further, to speed up the aggregation process, we also propose a knowledge transfer technique, self-distillation, which transfers the knowledge of augmentation into the model itself. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our data augmentation framework on various fully-supervised settings including the few-shot and imbalanced classification scenarios.
01	This paper addresses the problem of incremental domain adaptation (IDA) in natural language processing (NLP). We assume each domain comes one after another, and that we could only access data in the current domain. The goal of IDA is  to build a unified model performing well on all the domains that we have encountered. We adopt the recurrent neural network (RNN) widely used in NLP, but augment it with a directly parameterized memory bank, which is retrieved by an attention mechanism at each step of RNN transition. The memory bank provides a natural way of IDA: when adapting our model to a new domain, we progressively add new slots to the memory bank, which increases the number of parameters, and thus the model capacity. We learn the new memory slots and fine-tune existing parameters by back-propagation. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly better performance than fine-tuning alone. Compared with expanding hidden states, our approach is more robust for old domains, shown by both empirical and theoretical results. Our model also outperforms previous work of IDA including elastic weight consolidation and progressive neural networks in the experiments.
01	We address two challenges of probabilistic topic modelling in order to better estimatethe probability of a word in a given context, i.e., P(wordjcontext) : (1) NoLanguage Structure in Context: Probabilistic topic models ignore word order bysummarizing a given context as a “bag-of-word” and consequently the semanticsof words in the context is lost. In this work, we incorporate language structureby combining a neural autoregressive topic model (TM) with a LSTM based languagemodel (LSTM-LM) in a single probabilistic framework. The LSTM-LMlearns a vector-space representation of each word by accounting for word orderin local collocation patterns, while the TM simultaneously learns a latent representationfrom the entire document. In addition, the LSTM-LM models complexcharacteristics of language (e.g., syntax and semantics), while the TM discoversthe underlying thematic structure in a collection of documents. We unite two complementaryparadigms of learning the meaning of word occurrences by combininga topic model and a language model in a unified probabilistic framework, namedas ctx-DocNADE. (2) Limited Context and/or Smaller training corpus of documents:In settings with a small number of word occurrences (i.e., lack of context)in short text or data sparsity in a corpus of few documents, the application of TMsis challenging. We address this challenge by incorporating external knowledgeinto neural autoregressive topic models via a language modelling approach: weuse word embeddings as input of a LSTM-LM with the aim to improve the wordtopicmapping on a smaller and/or short-text corpus. The proposed DocNADEextension is named as ctx-DocNADEe.We present novel neural autoregressive topic model variants coupled with neurallanguage models and embeddings priors that consistently outperform state-of-theartgenerative topic models in terms of generalization (perplexity), interpretability(topic coherence) and applicability (retrieval and classification) over 6 long-textand 8 short-text datasets from diverse domains.
10	To construct representations for natural language sequences, information from two main sources needs to be captured: (i) semantic meaning of individual words, and (ii) their compositionality. These two types of information are usually represented in the form of word embeddings and compositional functions, respectively. For the latter, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been considered. There has not been a rigorous evaluation regarding the relative importance of each component to different text-representation-based tasks; i.e., how important is the modeling capacity of word embeddings alone, relative to the added value of a compositional function? In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparative study between Simple Word Embeddings-based Models (SWEMs), with no compositional parameters, relative to employing word embeddings within RNN/CNN-based models. Surprisingly, SWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered. Moreover, in a new SWEM setup, we propose to employ a max-pooling operation over the learned word-embedding matrix of a given sentence. This approach is demonstrated to extract complementary features relative to the averaging operation standard to SWEMs, while endowing our model with better interpretability. To further validate our observations, we examine the information utilized by different models to make predictions, revealing interesting properties of word embeddings.
10	Exploration strategy design is one of the challenging problems in reinforcement learning~(RL), especially when the environment contains a large state space or sparse rewards. During exploration, the agent tries to discover novel areas or high reward~(quality) areas. In most existing methods, the novelty and quality in the neighboring area of the current state are not well utilized to guide the exploration of the agent. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel RL framework, called \underline{c}lustered \underline{r}einforcement \underline{l}earning~(CRL), for efficient exploration in RL. CRL adopts clustering to divide the collected states into several clusters, based on which a bonus reward reflecting both novelty and quality in the neighboring area~(cluster) of the current state is given to the agent. Experiments on several continuous control tasks and several Atari-2600 games show that CRL can outperform other state-of-the-art methods to achieve the best performance in most cases.
10	Motivated by applications to unsupervised learning, we consider the problem of measuring mutual information. Recent analysis has shown that naive kNN estimators of mutual information have serious statistical limitations motivating more refined methods. In this paper we prove that serious statistical limitations are inherent to any measurement method. More specifically, we show that any distribution-free high-confidence lower bound on mutual information cannot be larger than $O(\ln N)$ where $N$ is the size of the data sample. We also analyze the Donsker-Varadhan lower bound on KL divergence in particular and show that, when simple statistical considerations are taken into account, this bound can never produce a high-confidence value larger than $\ln N$. While large high-confidence lower bounds are impossible, in practice one can use estimators without formal guarantees. We suggest expressing mutual information as a difference of entropies and using cross entropy as an entropy estimator.  We observe that, although cross entropy is only an upper bound on entropy, cross-entropy estimates converge to the true cross entropy at the rate of $1/\sqrt{N}$.
10	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used in state-of-the-art models in domains such as speech recognition, machine translation, and language modelling. Sparsity is a technique to reduce compute and memory requirements of deep learning models. Sparse RNNs are easier to deploy on devices and high-end server processors. Even though sparse operations need less compute and memory relative to their dense counterparts, the speed-up observed by using sparse operations is less than expected on different hardware platforms. In order to address this issue, we investigate two different approaches to induce block sparsity in RNNs: pruning blocks of weights in a layer and using group lasso regularization with pruning to create blocks of weights with zeros. Using these techniques, we can create block-sparse RNNs with sparsity ranging from 80% to 90% with a small loss in accuracy. This technique allows us to reduce the model size by roughly 10x. Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to recover this loss in accuracy while maintaining high block sparsity and reducing the overall parameter count. Our technique works with a variety of block sizes up to 32x32. Block-sparse RNNs eliminate overheads related to data storage and irregular memory accesses while increasing hardware efficiency compared to unstructured sparsity.
10	We present methodology for using dynamic evaluation to improve neural sequence models. Models are adapted to recent history via a gradient descent based mechanism, causing them to assign higher probabilities to re-occurring sequential patterns. Dynamic evaluation outperforms existing adaptation approaches in our comparisons. Dynamic evaluation improves the state-of-the-art word-level perplexities on the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 datasets to 51.1 and 44.3 respectively, and the state-of-the-art character-level cross-entropies on the text8 and Hutter Prize datasets to 1.19 bits/char and 1.08 bits/char respectively.
10	"Recently, there is regained interest in large batch training of neural networks, both of theory and practice. New insights and methods allowed certain models to be trained using large batches with no adverse impact on performance. Most works focused on accelerating wall clock training time by modifying the learning rate schedule, without introducing accuracy degradation. We propose to use large batch training to boost accuracy and accelerate convergence by combining it with data augmentation. Our method, ""batch augmentation"", suggests using multiple instances of each sample at the same large batch. We show empirically that this simple yet effective method improves convergence and final generalization accuracy. We further suggest possible reasons for its success."
01	Variational approaches based on neural networks are showing promise for estimating mutual information (MI) between high dimensional variables. However, they can be difficult to use in practice due to poorly understood bias/variance tradeoffs. We theoretically show that, under some conditions, estimators such as MINE exhibit variance that could grow exponentially with the true  amount of underlying MI. We also empirically demonstrate that existing estimators fail to satisfy basic self-consistency properties of MI, such as data processing and additivity under independence. Based on a unified perspective of variational approaches, we develop a new estimator that focuses on variance reduction. Empirical results on standard benchmark tasks demonstrate that our proposed estimator exhibits improved bias-variance trade-offs on standard benchmark tasks.
10	Robust Reinforcement Learning aims to find the optimal policy with some degree of robustness to environmental dynamics. Existing learning algorithms usually enable the robustness though disturbing the current state or simulated environmental parameters in a heuristic way, which lack quantified robustness to the system dynamics (i.e.  transition probability).  To overcome this issue, we leverage Wasserstein distance to measure the disturbance to the reference transition probability. With Wasserstein distance, we are able to connect transition probability disturbance to the state disturbance, and reduces an infinite-dimensional optimization problem to a finite-dimensional risk-aware problem. Through the derived risk-aware optimal Bellman equation,  we first show the existence of optimal robust policies,  provide  a  sensitivity  analysis  for  the  perturbations,  and  then  design  a novel robust learning algorithm—WassersteinRobustAdvantageActor-Critic algorithm (WRA2C). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified in theCart-Pole environment.
10	Human-computer conversation systems have attracted much attention in Natural Language Processing. Conversation systems can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (namely a query) in a large conversational repository and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches synthesize new replies. Both ways have certain advantages but suffer from their own disadvantages. We propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based conversation system. The retrieved candidates, in addition to the original query, are fed to a reply generator via a neural network, so that the model is aware of more information. The generated reply together with the retrieved ones then participates in a re-ranking process to find the final reply to output. Experimental results show that such an ensemble system outperforms each single module by a large margin.
10	L1 and L2 regularizers are critical tools in machine learning due to their ability to simplify solutions. However, imposing strong L1 or L2 regularization with gradient descent method easily fails, and this limits the generalization ability of the underlying neural networks. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate how and why training fails for strong regularization. Specifically, we examine how gradients change over time for different regularization strengths and provide an analysis why the gradients diminish so fast. We find that there exists a tolerance level of regularization strength, where the learning completely fails if the regularization strength goes beyond it. We propose a simple but novel method, Delayed Strong Regularization, in order to moderate the tolerance level. Experiment results show that our proposed approach indeed achieves strong regularization for both L1 and L2 regularizers and improves both accuracy and sparsity on public data sets. Our source code is published.
10	Inspired by the advances in biological science, the study of sparse binary projection models has attracted considerable recent research attention. The models project dense input samples into a higher-dimensional space and output sparse binary data representations after Winner-Take-All competition, subject to the constraint that the projection matrix is also sparse and binary. Following the work along this line, we developed a supervised-WTA model when training samples with both input and output representations are available, from which the optimal projection matrix can be obtained with a simple, efficient yet effective algorithm. We further extended the model and the algorithm to an unsupervised setting where only the input representation of the samples is available. In a series of empirical evaluation on similarity search tasks, the proposed models reported significantly improved results over the state-of-the-art methods in both search accuracy and running time. The successful results give us strong confidence that the work provides a highly practical tool to real world applications.
10	This paper proposes Metagross (Meta Gated Recursive Controller), a new neural sequence modeling unit. Our proposed unit is characterized by recursive parameterization of its gating functions, i.e., gating mechanisms of Metagross are controlled by instances of itself, which are repeatedly called in a recursive fashion. This can be interpreted as a form of meta-gating and recursively parameterizing a recurrent model. We postulate that our proposed inductive bias provides modeling benefits pertaining to learning with inherently hierarchically-structured sequence data (e.g., language, logical or music tasks). To this end, we conduct extensive experiments on recursive logic tasks (sorting, tree traversal, logical inference), sequential pixel-by-pixel classification, semantic parsing, code generation, machine translation and polyphonic music modeling, demonstrating the widespread utility of the proposed approach, i.e., achieving state-of-the-art (or close) performance on all tasks.
10	Lead bias is a common phenomenon in news summarization, where early parts of an article often contain the most salient information. While many algorithms exploit this fact in summary generation, it has a detrimental effect on teaching the model to discriminate and extract important information. We propose that the lead bias can be leveraged in a simple and effective way in our favor to pretrain abstractive news summarization models on large-scale unlabelled corpus: predicting the leading sentences using the rest of an article. Via careful data cleaning and filtering, our transformer-based pretrained model without any finetuning achieves remarkable results over various news summarization tasks. With further finetuning, our model outperforms many competitive baseline models. For example, the pretrained model without finetuning outperforms pointer-generator network on CNN/DailyMail dataset. The finetuned model obtains 3.2% higher ROUGE-1, 1.6% higher ROUGE-2 and 2.1% higher ROUGE-L scores than the best baseline model on XSum dataset.
10	In unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), classifiers for the target domain (TD) are trained with clean labeled data from the source domain (SD) and unlabeled data from TD. However, in the wild, it is hard to acquire a large amount of perfectly clean labeled data in SD given limited budget. Hence, we consider a new, more realistic and more challenging problem setting, where classifiers have to be trained with noisy labeled data from SD and unlabeled data from TD---we name it wildly UDA (WUDA). We show that WUDA ruins all UDA methods if taking no care of label noise in SD, and to this end, we propose a Butterfly framework, a powerful and efficient solution to WUDA. Butterfly maintains four models (e.g., deep networks) simultaneously, where two take care of all adaptations (i.e., noisy-to-clean, labeled-to-unlabeled, and SD-to-TD-distributional) and then the other two can focus on classification in TD. As a consequence, Butterfly possesses all the conceptually necessary components for solving WUDA. Experiments demonstrate that under WUDA, Butterfly significantly outperforms existing baseline methods.
10	We present a novel regularization strategy for training neural networks which we call ``BitNet''. The parameters of neural networks are usually unconstrained and have a dynamic range dispersed over a real valued range. Our key idea is to control the expressive power of the network by dynamically quantizing the range and set of values that the parameters can take. We formulate this idea using a novel end-to-end approach  that regularizes a typical classification loss function. Our regularizer is inspired by the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. For each layer of the network, our approach optimizes a translation and scaling factor along with integer-valued parameters. We empirically compare BitNet to an equivalent unregularized model on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. We show that BitNet converges faster to a superior quality solution. Additionally, the resulting model is significantly smaller in size due to the use of integer instead of floating-point parameters.
10	We present the ADaptive Adversarial Imitation Learning (ADAIL) algorithm for learning adaptive policies that can be transferred between environments of varying dynamics, by imitating a small number of demonstrations collected from a single source domain. This problem is important in robotic learning because in real world scenarios 1) reward functions are hard to obtain, 2) learned policies from one domain are difficult to deploy in another due to varying source to target domain statistics, 3) collecting expert demonstrations in multiple environments where the dynamics are known and controlled is often infeasible. We address these constraints by building upon recent advances in adversarial imitation learning; we condition our policy on a learned dynamics embedding and we employ a domain-adversarial loss to learn a dynamics-invariant discriminator. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on simulated control tasks with varying environment dynamics and the learned adaptive agent outperforms several recent baselines.
10	The existing graph neural networks (GNNs) based on the spectral graph convolutional operator have been criticized for its performance degradation, which is especially common for the models with deep architectures. In this paper, we further identify the suspended animation problem with the existing GNNs. Such a problem happens when the model depth reaches the suspended animation limit, and the model will not respond to the training data any more and become not learnable. Analysis about the causes of the suspended animation problem with existing GNNs will be provided in this paper, whereas several other peripheral factors that will impact the problem will be reported as well. To resolve the problem, we introduce the GRESNET (Graph Residual Network) framework in this paper, which creates extensively connected highways to involve nodes’ raw features or intermediate representations throughout the graph for all the model layers. Different from the other learning settings, the extensive connections in the graph data will render the existing simple residual learning methods fail to work. We prove the effectiveness of the introduced new graph residual terms from the norm preservation perspective, which will help avoid dramatic changes to the node’s representations between sequential layers. Detailed studies about the GRESNET framework for many existing GNNs, including GCN, GAT and LOOPYNET, will be reported in the paper with extensive empirical experiments on real-world benchmark datasets.
10	The goal of lifetime clustering is to develop an inductive model that maps subjects into $K$ clusters according to their underlying (unobserved) lifetime distribution. We introduce a neural-network based lifetime clustering model that can find cluster assignments by directly maximizing the divergence between the empirical lifetime distributions of the clusters. Accordingly, we define a novel clustering loss function over the lifetime distributions (of entire clusters) based on a tight upper bound of the two-sample Kuiper test p-value. The resultant model is robust to the modeling issues associated with the unobservability of termination signals, and does not assume proportional hazards. Our results in real and synthetic datasets show significantly better lifetime clusters (as evaluated by C-index, Brier Score, Logrank score and adjusted Rand index) as compared to competing approaches.
10	Reinforcement  Learning  (RL) problem can be solved in two different ways - the Value function-based approach and the policy optimization-based approach - to eventually arrive at an optimal policy for the given environment. One of the recent breakthroughs in reinforcement learning is the use of deep neural networks as function approximators to approximate the value function or q-function in a reinforcement learning scheme. This has led to results with agents automatically learning how to play games like alpha-go showing better-than-human performance. Deep Q-learning networks (DQN) and  Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are two such methods that have shown state-of-the-art results in recent times. Among the many variants of RL, an important class of problems is where the state and action spaces are continuous --- autonomous robots, autonomous vehicles, optimal control are all examples of such problems that can lend themselves naturally to reinforcement based algorithms, and have continuous state and action spaces. In this paper, we adapt and combine approaches such as DQN and DDPG in novel ways to outperform the earlier results for continuous state and action space problems.  We believe these results are a valuable addition to the fast-growing body of results on Reinforcement Learning, more so for continuous state and action space problems.
01	In this paper we introduce a simple, robust approach to hierarchically training an agent in the setting of sparse reward tasks.The agent is split into a low-level and a high-level policy. The low-level policy only accesses internal, proprioceptive dimensions of the state observation. The low-level policies are trained with a simple reward that encourages changing the values of the non-proprioceptive dimensions. Furthermore, it is induced to be periodic with the use a ``phase function.'' The high-level policy is trained using a sparse, task-dependent reward, and operates by choosing which of the low-level policies to run at any given time. Using this approach, we solve difficult maze and navigation tasks with sparse rewards using the Mujoco Ant and Humanoid agents and show improvement over recent hierarchical methods. 
10	State of the art visual relation detection methods mostly rely on object information extracted from RGB images such as predicted class probabilities, 2D bounding boxes and feature maps. In this paper, we argue that the 3D positions of objects in space can provide additional valuable information about object relations. This information helps not only to detect spatial relations, such as \textit{standing behind}, but also non-spatial relations, such as \textit{holding}. Since 3D information of a scene is not easily accessible, we propose incorporating a pre-trained RGB-to-Depth model within visual relation detection frameworks. We discuss different feature extraction strategies from depth maps and show their critical role in relation detection.Our experiments confirm that the performance of state-of-the-art visual relation detection approaches can significantly be improved by utilizing depth map information.
10	As deep CNN classifier performance using ground-truth labels has begun to asymptote at near-perfect levels, a key aim for the field is to extend training paradigms to capture further useful structure in natural image data and improve model robustness and generalization. In this paper, we present a novel natural image benchmark for making this extension, which we call CIFAR10H. This new dataset comprises a human-derived, full distribution over labels for each image of the CIFAR10 test set, offering the ability to assess the generalization of state-of-the-art CIFAR10 models, as well as investigate the effects of including this information in model training. We show that classification models trained on CIFAR10 do not generalize as well to our dataset as it does to traditional extensions, and that models fine-tuned using our label information are able to generalize better to related datasets, complement popular data augmentation schemes, and provide robustness to adversarial attacks. We explain these improvements in terms of better empirical approximations to the expected loss function over natural images and their categories in the visual world.
10	We present a new approach for efficient exploration which leverages a low-dimensional encoding of the environment learned with a combination of model-based and model-free objectives. Our approach uses intrinsic rewards that are based on a weighted distance of nearest neighbors in the low dimensional representational space to gauge novelty.We then leverage these intrinsic rewards for sample-efficient exploration with planning routines in representational space.One key element of our approach is that we perform more gradient steps in-between every environment step in order to ensure the model accuracy. We test our approach on a number of maze tasks, as well as a control problem and show that our exploration approach is more sample-efficient compared to strong baselines. 
01	We present a representation for describing transition models in complex uncertain domains using relational rules.  For any action, a rule selects a set of relevant objects and computes a distribution over properties of just those objects in the resulting state given their properties in the previous state.  An iterative greedy algorithm is used to construct a set of deictic references that determine which objects are relevant in any given state.   Feed-forward neural networks are used to learn the transition distribution on the relevant objects' properties.  This strategy is demonstrated to be both more versatile and more sample efficient than learning a monolithic transition model in a simulated domain in which a robot pushes stacks of objects on a cluttered table.
01	Character-based neural machine translation (NMT) models alleviate out-of-vocabulary issues, learn morphology, and move us closer to completely end-to-end translation systems.  Unfortunately, they are also very brittle and easily falter when presented with noisy data. In this paper, we confront NMT models with synthetic and natural sources of noise. We find that state-of-the-art models fail to translate even moderately noisy texts that humans have no trouble comprehending. We explore two approaches to increase model robustness: structure-invariant word representations and robust training on noisy texts. We find that a model based on a character convolutional neural network is able to simultaneously learn representations robust to multiple kinds of noise. 
10	In this paper, we propose a novel regularization method, RotationOut, for neural networks. Different from Dropout that handles each neuron/channel independently, RotationOut regards its input layer as an entire vector and introduces regularization by randomly rotating the vector. RotationOut can also be used in convolutional layers and recurrent layers with a small modification.We further use a noise analysis method to interpret the difference between RotationOut and Dropout in co-adaptation reduction. Using this method, we also show how to use RotationOut/Dropout together with Batch Normalization. Extensive experiments in vision and language tasks are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Codes will be available.
01	The huge size of deep networks hinders their use in small computing devices. In this paper, we consider compressing the network by weight quantization. We extend a recently proposed loss-aware weight binarization scheme to ternarization, with possibly different scaling parameters for the positive and negative weights, and m-bit (where m > 2) quantization. Experiments on feedforward and recurrent neural networks show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art weight quantization algorithms, and is as accurate (or even more accurate) than the full-precision network.
10	Animals develop novel skills not only through the interaction with the environment but also from the influence of the others. In this work we model the social influence into the scheme of reinforcement learning, enabling the agents to learn both from the environment and from their peers. Specifically, we first define a metric to measure the distance between policies then quantitatively derive the definition of uniqueness. Unlike previous precarious joint optimization approaches, the social uniqueness motivation in our work is imposed as a constraint to encourage the agent to learn a policy different from the existing agents while still solve the primal task. The resulting algorithm, namely Interior Policy Differentiation (IPD), brings about performance improvement as well as a collection of policies that solve a given task with distinct behaviors
10	Models parameterized by deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results  in  many  domains.  These  models  are  usually  trained  using  the  maximum likelihood principle with a finite set of observations. However, training deep probabilistic models with maximum likelihood can lead to the issue we refer to as input forgetting. In deep generative latent-variable models, input forgetting corresponds to posterior collapse---a phenomenon in which the latent variables are driven independent from the observations. However input forgetting can happen even in the absence of latent variables.  We attribute input forgetting in deep probabilistic models to the finite sample dilemma of maximum likelihood.  We formalize this problem and propose a learning criterion---termed reflective likelihood---that explicitly prevents input forgetting. We empirically observe that the proposed criterion significantly outperforms the maximum likelihood objective when used in classification under a skewed class distribution.  Furthermore, the reflective likelihood objective prevents posterior collapse when used to train stochastic auto-encoders with amortized inference.  For example in a neural topic modeling experiment, the reflective likelihood objective leads to better quantitative and qualitative results than the variational auto-encoder and the importance-weighted auto-encoder.
10	Multi-stage training and knowledge transfer from a large-scale pretrain task to various fine-tune end tasks have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), with state-of-the-art performances constantly being improved. In this paper, we develop a multi-stage influence function score to track predictions from a finetune model all the way back to the pretrain data. With this score, we can identify the pretrain examples in the pretrain task that contribute most to a prediction in the fine-tune task. The proposed multi-stage influence function generalizes the original influence function for a single model in Koh et al 2017, thereby enabling influence computation through both pretrain and fine-tune models. We test our proposed method in various experiments to show its effectiveness and potential applications.
01	Adversarial training is a principled approach for training robust neural networks. Despite of tremendous successes in practice, its theoretical properties still remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide new theoretical insights of gradient descent based adversarial training by studying its computational properties, specifically on its implicit bias. We take the binary classification task on linearly separable data as an illustrative example, where the loss asymptotically attains its infimum as the parameter diverges to infinity along certain directions. Specifically, we show that for any fixed iteration $T$, when the adversarial perturbation during training has proper bounded L2 norm,  the classifier learned by gradient descent based adversarial training converges in direction to the maximum L2 norm margin classifier at the rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, significantly faster than the rate $O(1/\log T}$ of training with clean data. In addition, when the adversarial perturbation during training has bounded Lq norm, the resulting classifier converges in direction to a maximum mixed-norm margin classifier, which has a natural interpretation of robustness, as being the maximum L2 norm margin classifier under worst-case bounded Lq norm perturbation to the data.  Our findings provide theoretical backups for adversarial training that it indeed promotes robustness against adversarial perturbation.
10	We develop a reinforcement learning based search assistant which can assist users through a set of actions and sequence of interactions to enable them realize their intent. Our approach caters to subjective search where the user is seeking digital assets such as images which is fundamentally different from the tasks which have objective and limited search modalities. Labeled conversational data is generally not available in such search tasks and training the agent through human interactions can be time consuming. We propose a stochastic virtual user which impersonates a real user and can be used to sample user behavior efficiently to train the agent which accelerates the bootstrapping of the agent. We develop A3C algorithm based context preserving architecture which enables the agent to provide contextual assistance to the user. We compare the A3C agent with Q-learning and evaluate its performance on average rewards and state values it obtains with the virtual user in validation episodes. Our experiments show that the agent learns to achieve higher rewards and better states.
01	Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms have achieved great success on many challenging benchmarks (e.g., Computer Go). However, they generally require a large number of rollouts, making their applications costly. Furthermore, it is also extremely challenging to parallelize MCTS due to its inherent sequential nature: each rollout heavily relies on the statistics (e.g., node visitation counts) estimated from previous simulations to achieve an effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In spite of these difficulties, we develop an algorithm, WU-UCT, to effectively parallelize MCTS, which achieves linear speedup and exhibits only limited performance loss with an increasing number of workers. The key idea in WU-UCT is a set of statistics that we introduce to track the number of on-going yet incomplete simulation queries (named as unobserved samples). These statistics are used to modify the UCT tree policy in the selection steps in a principled manner to retain effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff when we parallelize the most time-consuming expansion and simulation steps. Experiments on a proprietary benchmark and the Atari Game benchmark demonstrate the linear speedup and the superior performance of WU-UCT comparing to existing techniques.
10	Neural networks are known to be a class of highly expressive functions able to fit even random input-output mappings with 100% accuracy. In this work we present properties of neural networks that complement this aspect of expressivity. By using tools from Fourier analysis, we show that deep ReLU networks are biased towards low frequency functions, meaning that they cannot have local fluctuations without affecting their global behavior. Intuitively, this property is in line with the observation that over-parameterized networks find simple patterns that generalize across data samples. We also investigate how the shape of the data manifold affects expressivity by showing evidence that learning high frequencies gets easier with increasing manifold complexity, and present a theoretical understanding of this behavior. Finally, we study the robustness of the frequency components with respect to parameter perturbation, to develop the intuition that the parameters must be finely tuned to express high frequency functions.
01	Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is notoriously challenging. We propose and study an architectural modification, self-modulation, which improves GAN performance across different data sets, architectures, losses, regularizers, and hyperparameter settings. Intuitively, self-modulation allows the intermediate feature maps of a generator to change as a function of the input noise vector. While reminiscent of other conditioning techniques, it requires no labeled data. In a large-scale empirical study we observe a relative decrease of 5%-35% in FID. Furthermore, all else being equal, adding this modification to the generator leads to improved performance in 124/144 (86%) of the studied settings. Self-modulation is a simple architectural change that requires no additional parameter tuning, which suggests that it can be applied readily to any GAN.
10	Despite the recent success of Lipschitz regularization in stabilizing GAN training, the exact reason of its effectiveness remains poorly understood. It is commonly believed that the main function of K-Lipschitz regularization is to restrict the L2-norm of the neural network gradient to be smaller than a threshold K (e.g. K=1) such that || grad f || <= K. While in this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive fact that under typical GAN setups, the choice of K does not matter. This finding suggests that instead of keeping the neural network gradients small, an even more important function of Lipschitz regularization is its restriction on the domain and interval of attainable gradient values of the loss function. This avoids the bias of the loss function over input samples. Empirically, we verify our proposition on the MNIST, CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets.
01	The vulnerabilities of deep neural networks against adversarial examples have become a significant concern for deploying these models in sensitive domains. Devising a definitive defense against such attacks is proven to be challenging, and the methods relying on detecting adversarial samples are only valid when the attacker is oblivious to the detection mechanism. In this paper we present an adversarial example detection method that provides performance guarantee to norm constrained adversaries. The method is based on the idea of training adversarial robust subspace detectors using generative adversarial training (GAT). The novel GAT objective presents a saddle point problem similar to that of GANs; it has the same convergence property, and consequently supports the learning of class conditional distributions. We demonstrate that the saddle point problem could be reasonably solved by PGD attack, and further use the learned class conditional generative models to define generative detection/classification models that are both robust and more interpretable. We provide comprehensive evaluations of the above methods, and demonstrate their competitive performances and compelling properties on adversarial detection and robust classification problems.
10	Experience replay (ER) is crucial for attaining high data-efficiency in off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL).  ER entails the recall of experiences obtained in past iterations to compute gradient estimates for the current policy. However, the accuracy of such updates may deteriorate when the policy diverges from past behaviors, possibly undermining the effectiveness of ER. Previous off-policy RL algorithms mitigated this issue by tuning their hyper-parameters in order to abate policy changes. We propose ReF-ER, a method for active management of experiences in the Replay Memory (RM). ReF-ER forgets experiences that would be too unlikely with the current policy and constrains policy changes within a trust region of the behaviors in the RM. We couple ReF-ER with Q-learning, deterministic policy gradient and off-policy gradient methods to show that ReF-ER reliably improves the performance of continuous-action off-policy RL. We complement ReF-ER with a novel off-policy actor-critic algorithm (RACER) for continuous-action control. RACER employs a computationally efficient closed-form approximation of the action values and is shown to be highly competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark problems, while being robust to large hyper-parameter variations.
10	Large-batch SGD is important for scaling training of deep neural networks. However, without fine-tuning hyperparameter schedules, the generalization of the model may be hampered.We propose to use batch augmentation: replicating instances of samples within the same batch with different data augmentations. Batch augmentation acts as a regularizer and an accelerator, increasing both generalization and performance scaling for a fixed budget of optimization steps. We analyze the effect of batch augmentation on gradient variance and show that it empirically improves convergence for a wide variety of networks and datasets. Our results show that batch augmentation reduces the number of necessary SGD updates to achieve the same accuracy as the state-of-the-art.Overall, this simple yet effective method enables faster training and better generalization by allowing more computational resources to be used concurrently.
01	The dynamics of DNNs during gradient descent is described by the so-called Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). In this article, we show that the NTK allows one to gain precise insight into the Hessian of the cost of DNNs: we obtain a full characterization of the asymptotics of the spectrum of the Hessian, at initialization and during training. 
10	Recent years have witnessed two seemingly opposite developments of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). On one hand, increasing the density of CNNs by adding cross-layer connections achieve higher accuracy. On the other hand, creating sparsity structures through regularization and pruning methods enjoys lower computational costs. In this paper, we bridge these two by proposing a new network structure with locally dense yet externally sparse connections. This new structure uses dense modules, as basic building blocks and then sparsely connects these modules via a novel algorithm during the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the locally dense yet externally sparse structure could acquire competitive performance on benchmark tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet) while keeping the network structure slim.
10	Current end-to-end deep learning driving models have two problems: (1) Poorgeneralization ability of unobserved driving environment when diversity of train-ing driving dataset is limited (2) Lack of accident explanation ability when drivingmodels don’t work as expected. To tackle these two problems, rooted on the be-lieve that knowledge of associated easy task is benificial for addressing difficulttask, we proposed a new driving model which is composed of perception modulefor see and think and driving module for behave, and trained it with multi-taskperception-related basic knowledge and driving knowledge stepwisely.  Specifi-cally segmentation map and depth map (pixel level understanding of images) wereconsidered as what & where and how far knowledge for tackling easier driving-related perception problems before generating final control commands for difficultdriving task. The results of experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of multi-task perception knowledge for better generalization and accident explanation abil-ity. With our method the average sucess rate of finishing most difficult navigationtasks in untrained city of CoRL test surpassed current benchmark method for 15percent in trained weather and 20 percent in untrained weathers.
10	In colored graphs, node classes are often associated with either their neighbors class or with information not incorporated in the graph associated with each node. We here propose that node classes are also associated with topological features of the nodes. We use this association to improve Graph machine learning in general and specifically, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). First, we show that even in the absence of any external information on nodes, a good accuracy can be obtained on the prediction of the node class using either topological features, or using the neighbors class as an input to a GCN. This accuracy is slightly less than the one that can be obtained using content based GCN.Secondly, we show that explicitly adding the topology as an input to the GCN does not improve the accuracy when combined with external information on nodes. However,  adding an additional adjacency matrix with edges between distant nodes with similar topology to the GCN does significantly improve its accuracy, leading to results better than all state of the art methods in multiple datasets. 
01	High-performance Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in many real-world applications e.g., cloud prediction APIs. Recent advances in model functionality stealing attacks via black-box access (i.e., inputs in, predictions out) threaten the business model of such applications, which require a lot of time, money, and effort to develop. Existing defenses take a passive role against stealing attacks, such as by truncating predicted information. We find such passive defenses ineffective against DNN stealing attacks. In this paper, we propose the first defense which actively perturbs predictions targeted at poisoning the training objective of the attacker. We find our defense effective across a wide range of challenging datasets and DNN model stealing attacks, and additionally outperforms existing defenses. Our defense is the first that can withstand highly accurate model stealing attacks for tens of thousands of queries, amplifying the attacker's error rate up to a factor of 85$\times$ with minimal impact on the utility for benign users.
10	Activity of populations of sensory neurons carries stimulus information in both the temporal and the spatial dimensions. This poses the question of how to compactly represent all the information that the population codes carry across all these dimensions. Here, we developed an analytical method to factorize a large number of retinal ganglion cells' spike trains into a robust low-dimensional representation that captures efficiently both their spatial and temporal information. In particular, we extended previously used single-trial space-by-time tensor decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization to efficiently discount pre-stimulus baseline activity. On data recorded from retinal ganglion cells with strong pre-stimulus baseline, we showed that in situations were the stimulus elicits a strong change in firing rate, our extensions yield a boost in stimulus decoding performance. Our results thus suggest that taking into account the baseline can be important for finding a compact information-rich representation of neural activity.
10	Meta-learning has recently achieved success in many optimization problems. In general, a meta learner g(.) could be learned for a base model f(.) on a variety of tasks, such that it can be more efficient on a new task. In this paper, we make some key modifications to enhance the performance of meta-learning models. (1) we leverage different meta-strategies for different modules to optimize them separately: we use conservative “slow learners” on low-level basic feature representation layers and “fast learners” on high-level task-specific layers; (2) Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis on why the proposed approach works, based on a case study on a two-layer MLP. We evaluate our model on synthetic MLP regression, as well as low-shot learning tasks on Omniglot and ImageNet benchmarks. We demonstrate that our approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
10	Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) provide an elegant and versatile way to sample sets of items that balance the point-wise quality with the set-wise diversity of selected items. For this reason, they have gained prominence in many machine learning applications that rely on subset selection. However, sampling from a DPP over a ground set of size N is a costly operation, requiring in general an O(N^3) preprocessing cost and an O(Nk^3) sampling cost for subsets of size k. We approach this problem by introducing DppNets: generative deep models that produce DPP-like samples for arbitrary ground sets.  We develop an inhibitive attention mechanism based on transformer networks that captures a notion of dissimilarity between feature vectors.  We show theoretically that such an approximation is sensible as it maintains the guarantees of inhibition or dissimilarity that makes DPP so powerful and unique.  Empirically, we demonstrate that samples from our model receive high likelihood under the more expensive DPP alternative.
01	Generative Adversarial Networks are one of the leading tools in generative modeling, image editing and content creation. However, they are hard to train as they require a delicate balancing act between two deep networks fighting a never ending duel. Some of the most promising adversarial models today minimize a Wasserstein objective. It is smoother and more stable to optimize. In this paper, we show that the Wasserstein distance is just one out of a large family of objective functions that yield these properties. By making the discriminator of a GAN robust to adversarial attacks we can turn any GAN objective into a smooth and stable loss. We experimentally show that any GAN objective, including Wasserstein GANs, benefit from adversarial robustness both quantitatively and qualitatively. The training additionally becomes more robust to suboptimal choices of hyperparameters, model architectures, or objective functions.
01	Word embedding is a powerful tool in natural language processing. In this paper we consider the problem of word embedding composition \--- given vector representations of two words, compute a vector for the entire phrase. We give a generative model that can capture specific syntactic relations between words. Under our model, we prove that the correlations between three words (measured by their PMI) form a tensor that has an approximate low rank Tucker decomposition. The result of the Tucker decomposition gives the word embeddings as well as a core tensor, which can be used to produce better compositions of the word embeddings. We also complement our theoretical results with experiments that verify our assumptions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the new composition method.
10	The use of deep learning for a wide range of data problems has increased the need for understanding and diagnosing these models, and deep learning interpretation techniques have become an essential tool for data analysts. Although numerous model interpretation methods have been proposed in recent years, most of these procedures are based on heuristics with little or no theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for saliency estimation for black box computer vision models. We build a model-agnostic estimation procedure that is statistically consistent and passes the saliency checks of Adebayo et al. (2018). Our method requires solving a linear program, whose solution can be efficiently computed in polynomial time. Through our theoretical analysis, we establish an upper bound on the number of model evaluations needed to recover the region of importance with high probability, and build a new perturbation scheme for estimation of local gradients that is shown to be more efficient than the commonly used random perturbation schemes. Validity of the new method is demonstrated through sensitivity analysis.
10	Linear Programs (LPs) are a fundamental class of optimization problems with a wide variety of applications. Fast algorithms for solving LPs are the workhorse of many combinatorial optimization algorithms, especially those involving integer programming. One popular method to solve LPs is the simplex method which, at each iteration, traverses the surface of the polyhedron of feasible solutions. At each vertex of the polyhedron, one of several heuristics chooses the next neighboring vertex, and these vary in accuracy and computational cost. We use deep value-based reinforcement learning to learn a pivoting strategy that at each iteration chooses between two of the most popular pivot rules -- Dantzig and steepest edge. Because the latter is typically more accurate and computationally costly than the former, we assign a higher wall time-based cost to steepest edge iterations than Dantzig iterations. We optimize this weighted cost on a neural net architecture designed for the simplex algorithm. We obtain between 20% to 50% reduction in the gap between weighted iterations of the individual pivoting rules, and the best possible omniscient policies for LP relaxations of randomly generated instances of five-city Traveling Salesman Problem. 
10	Long training times have increasingly become a burden for researchers by slowing down the pace of innovation, with some models taking days or weeks to train. In this paper, a new, general technique is presented that aims to speed up the training process by using a thinned-down training dataset. By leveraging autoencoders and the unique properties of embedding spaces, we are able to filter training datasets to include only those samples that matter the most. Through evaluation on a standard CIFAR-10 image classification task, this technique is shown to be effective. With this technique, training times can be reduced with a minimal loss in accuracy. Conversely, given a fixed training time budget, the technique was shown to improve accuracy by over 50%. This technique is a practical tool for achieving better results with large datasets and limited computational budgets.
10	Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions, explore the given environments, and reach the desired target locations. These step-by-step navigational instructions are extremely useful in navigating new environments which the agent does not know about previously. Most recent works that study VLN observe a significant performance drop when tested on unseen environments (i.e., environments not used in training), indicating that the neural agent models are highly biased towards training environments. Although this issue is considered as one of major challenges in VLN research, it is still under-studied and needs a clearer explanation. In this work, we design novel diagnosis experiments via environment re-splitting and feature replacement, looking into possible reasons of this environment bias. We observe that neither the language nor the underlying navigational graph, but the low-level visual appearance conveyed by ResNet features directly affects the agent model and contributes to this environment bias in results. According to this observation, we explore several kinds of semantic representations which contain less low-level visual information, hence the agent learned with these features could be better generalized to unseen testing environments. Without modifying the baseline agent model and its training method, our explored semantic features significantly decrease the performance gap between seen and unseen on multiple datasets (i.e., 8.6% to 0.2% on R2R, 23.9% to 0.1% on R4R, and 3.74 to 0.17 on CVDN) and achieve competitive unseen results to previous state-of-the-art models.
10	    Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in a variety of tasks in  computer vision and beyond. One of the major obstacles hindering the ubiquitous use of CNNs for inference on low-power edge devices is their high computational complexity and memory bandwidth requirements. The latter often dominates the energy footprint on modern hardware. In this paper, we introduce a lossy transform coding approach, inspired by image and video compression, designed to reduce the memory bandwidth due to the storage of intermediate activation calculation results. Our method does not require fine-tuning the network weights and halves the data transfer volumes to the main memory by compressing feature maps, which are highly correlated, with variable length coding. Our method outperform previous approach in term of the number of bits per value with minor accuracy degradation on ResNet-34 and MobileNetV2. We analyze the performance of our approach on a variety of CNN architectures and demonstrate that FPGA implementation of ResNet-18 with our approach results in a reduction of around 40% in the memory energy footprint, compared to quantized network, with negligible impact on accuracy. When allowing accuracy degradation of up to 2%, the reduction of 60% is achieved. A reference implementation}accompanies the paper.
10	More accurate machine learning models often demand more computation and memory at test time, making them difficult to deploy on CPU- or memory-constrained devices. Model compression (also known as distillation) alleviates this burden by training a less expensive student model to mimic the expensive teacher model while maintaining most of the original accuracy. However, when fresh data is unavailable for the compression task, the teacher's training data is typically reused, leading to suboptimal compression. In this work, we propose to augment the compression dataset with synthetic data from a generative adversarial network (GAN) designed to approximate the training data distribution. Our GAN-assisted model compression (GAN-MC) significantly improves student accuracy for expensive models such as deep neural networks and large random forests on both image and tabular datasets. Building on these results, we propose a comprehensive metric—the Compression Score—to evaluate the quality of synthetic datasets based on their induced model compression performance. The Compression Score captures both data diversity and discriminability, and we illustrate its benefits over the popular Inception Score in the context of image classification.
01	Despite the state-of-the-art accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in various classification problems, their deployment onto resource constrained edge computing devices remains challenging due to their large size and complexity. Several recent studies have reported remarkable results in reducing this complexity through quantization of DNN models. However, these studies usually do not consider the changes in the loss function when performing quantization, nor do they take the different importances of DNN model parameters to the accuracy into account. We address these issues in this paper by proposing a new method, called adaptive quantization, which simplifies a trained DNN model by finding a unique, optimal precision for each network parameter such that the increase in loss is minimized. The optimization problem at the core of this method iteratively uses the loss function gradient to determine an error margin for each parameter and assigns it a precision accordingly. Since this problem uses linear functions, it is computationally cheap and, as we will show, has a closed-form approximate solution. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR, and SVHN datasets showed that the proposed method can achieve near or better than state-of-the-art reduction in model size with similar error rates. Furthermore, it can achieve compressions close to floating-point model compression methods without loss of accuracy.
10	"The Transformer architecture is widely used in natural language processing. Despite its success, the design principle of the Transformer remains elusive. In this paper, we provide a novel perspective towards understanding the architecture: we show that the Transformer can be mathematically interpreted as a numerical Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver for a convection-diffusion equation in a multi-particle dynamic system. In particular, how words in a sentence are abstracted into contexts by passing through the layers of the Transformer can be interpreted as approximating multiple particles' movement in the space using the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme and the Euler's method. Given this ODE's perspective, the rich literature of numerical analysis can be brought to guide us in designing effective structures beyond the Transformer. As an example, we propose to replace the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme by the Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme, a scheme that is more commonly used and with much lower local truncation errors. The Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme suggests that the self-attention and position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) sub-layers should not be treated equally. Instead, in each layer, two position-wise FFN sub-layers should be used, and the self-attention sub-layer is placed in between. This leads to a brand new architecture. Such an FFN-attention-FFN layer is ""Macaron-like"", and thus we call the network with this new architecture the Macaron Net. Through extensive experiments, we show that the Macaron Net is superior to the Transformer on both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. The reproducible code can be found on http://anonymized"
01	The performance of graph neural nets (GNNs) is known to gradually decrease with increasing number of layers. This decay is partly attributed to oversmoothing, where repeated graph convolutions eventually make node embeddings indistinguishable. We take a closer look at two different interpretations, aiming to quantify oversmoothing. Our main contribution is PairNorm, a novel normalization layer that is based on a careful analysis of the graph convolution operator, which prevents all node embeddings from becoming too similar. What is more, PairNorm is fast, easy to implement without any change to network architecture nor any additional parameters, and is broadly applicable to any GNN. Experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate that PairNorm makes deeper GCN, GAT, and SGC models more robust against oversmoothing, and significantly boosts performance for a new problem setting that benefits from deeper GNNs. Code is available at https://github.com/LingxiaoShawn/PairNorm.
10	We propose an implementation of GNN that predicts and imitates the motion be- haviors from observed swarm trajectory data. The network’s ability to capture interaction dynamics in swarms is demonstrated through transfer learning. We finally discuss the inherent availability and challenges in the scalability of GNN, and proposed a method to improve it with layer-wise tuning and mixing of data enabled by padding.
01	Learning to control an environment without hand-crafted rewards or expert data remains challenging and is at the frontier of reinforcement learning research. We present an unsupervised learning algorithm to train agents to achieve perceptually-specified goals using only a stream of observations and actions. Our agent simultaneously learns a goal-conditioned policy and a goal achievement reward function that measures how similar a state is to the goal state. This dual optimization leads to a co-operative game, giving rise to a learned reward function that reflects similarity in controllable aspects of the environment instead of distance in the space of observations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our agent to learn, in an unsupervised manner, to reach a diverse set of goals on three domains -- Atari, the DeepMind Control Suite and DeepMind Lab.
01	Short-and-sparse deconvolution (SaSD) is the problem of extracting localized, recurring motifs in signals with spatial or temporal structure. Variants of this problem arise in applications such as image deblurring, microscopy, neural spike sorting, and more. The problem is challenging in both theory and practice, as natural optimization formulations are nonconvex. Moreover, practical deconvolution problems involve smooth motifs (kernels) whose spectra decay rapidly, resulting in poor conditioning and numerical challenges. This paper is motivated by recent theoretical advances \citep{zhang2017global,kuo2019geometry}, which characterize the optimization landscape of a particular nonconvex formulation of SaSD. This is used to derive a provable algorithm that exactly solves certain non-practical instances of the SaSD problem. We leverage the key ideas from this theory (sphere constraints, data-driven initialization) to develop a practical algorithm, which performs well on data arising from a range of application areas. We highlight key additional challenges posed by the ill-conditioning of real SaSD problems and suggest heuristics (acceleration, continuation, reweighting) to mitigate them. Experiments demonstrate the performance and generality of the proposed method.
10	In anomaly detection (AD), one seeks to identify whether a test sample is abnormal,  given a data set of normal samples.   A recent and promising approach to AD relies on deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs),for unsupervised learning of the normal data distribution. In semi-supervised AD (SSAD), the data also includes a small sample of labeled anomalies. In this work,we propose two variational methods for training VAEs for SSAD. The intuitive idea in both methods is to train the encoder to ‘separate’ between latent vectors for normal and outlier data. We show that this idea can be derived from principled probabilistic formulations of the problem, and propose simple and effective algorithms.  Our methods can be applied to various data types, as we demonstrate on SSAD datasets ranging from natural images to astronomy and medicine, and can be combined with any VAE model architecture. When comparing to state-of-the-art SSAD methods that are not specific to particular data types, we obtain marked improvement in outlier detection.
10	While pre-training and fine-tuning, e.g., BERT~\citep{devlin2018bert}, GPT-2~\citep{radford2019language}, have achieved great success in language understanding and generation tasks, the pre-trained models are usually too big for online deployment in terms of both memory cost and inference speed, which hinders them from practical online usage. In this paper, we propose LightPAFF, a Lightweight Pre-training And Fine-tuning Framework that leverages two-stage knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a big teacher model to a lightweight student model in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. In this way the lightweight model can achieve similar accuracy as the big teacher model, but with much fewer parameters and thus faster online inference speed. LightPAFF can support different pre-training methods (such as BERT, GPT-2 and MASS~\citep{song2019mass}) and be applied to many downstream tasks. Experiments on three language understanding tasks, three language modeling tasks and three sequence to sequence generation tasks demonstrate that while achieving similar accuracy with the big BERT, GPT-2 and MASS models, LightPAFF reduces the model size by nearly 5x and improves online inference speed by 5x-7x.
10	Scaling end-to-end reinforcement learning to control real robots from vision presents a series of challenges, in particular in terms of sample efficiency. Against end-to-end learning, state representation learning can help learn a compact, efficient and relevant representation of states that speeds up policy learning, reducing the number of samples needed, and that is easier to interpret. We evaluate several state representation learning methods on goal based robotics tasks and propose a new unsupervised model that stacks representations and combines strengths of several of these approaches. This method encodes all the relevant features, performs on par or better than end-to-end learning, and is robust to hyper-parameters change.
10	Many goal-oriented dialog tasks, especially ones in which the dialog system has to interact with external knowledge sources such as databases, have to handle a large number of Named Entities (NEs). There are at least two challenges in handling NEs using neural methods in such settings: individual NEs may occur only rarely making it hard to learn good representations of them, and many of the Out Of Vocabulary words that occur during test time may be NEs. Thus, the need to interact well with these NEs has emerged as a serious challenge to building neural methods for goal-oriented dialog tasks. In this paper, we propose a new neural method for this problem, and present empirical evaluations on a structured Question answering task and three related goal-oriented dialog tasks that show that our proposed method can be effective in interacting with NEs in these settings.
10	In this paper, we design a generic framework for learning a robust text classification model that achieves accuracy comparable to standard full models under test-timebudget constraints. We take a different approach from existing methods and learn to dynamically delete a large fraction of unimportant words by a low-complexity selector such that the high-complexity classifier only needs to process a small fraction of important words. In addition, we propose a new data aggregation method to train the classifier, allowing it to make accurate predictions even on fragmented sequence of words. Our end-to-end method achieves state-of-the-art performance while its computational complexity scales linearly with the small fraction of important words in the whole corpus. Besides, a single deep neural network classifier trained by our framework can be dynamically tuned to different budget levels at inference time.
01	Answerer in Questioner's Mind (AQM) is an information-theoretic framework that has been recently proposed for task-oriented dialog systems. AQM benefits from asking a question that would maximize the information gain when it is asked. However, due to its intrinsic nature of explicitly calculating the information gain, AQM has a limitation when the solution space is very large. To address this, we propose AQM+ that can deal with a large-scale problem and ask a question that is more coherent to the current context of the dialog. We evaluate our method on GuessWhich, a challenging task-oriented visual dialog problem, where the number of candidate classes is near 10K. Our experimental results and ablation studies show that AQM+ outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a remarkable margin with a reasonable approximation. In particular, the proposed AQM+ reduces more than 60% of error as the dialog proceeds, while the comparative algorithms diminish the error by less than 6%. Based on our results, we argue that AQM+ is a general task-oriented dialog algorithm that can be applied for non-yes-or-no responses. 
10	The power of neural networks lies in their ability to generalize to unseen data, yet the underlying reasons for this phenomenon remain elusive. Numerous rigorous attempts have been made to explain generalization, but available bounds are still quite loose, and analysis does not always lead to true understanding. The goal of this work is to make generalization more intuitive. Using visualization methods, we discuss the mystery of generalization, the geometry of loss landscapes, and how the curse (or, rather, the blessing) of dimensionality causes optimizers to settle into minima that generalize well. 
01	Humans learn to solve tasks of increasing complexity by building on top of previously acquired knowledge. Typically, there exists a natural progression in the tasks that we learn – most do not require completely independent solutions, but can be broken down into simpler subtasks. We propose to represent a solver for each task as a neural module that calls existing modules (solvers for simpler tasks) in a functional program-like manner. Lower modules are a black box to the calling module, and communicate only via a query and an output. Thus, a module for a new task learns to query existing modules and composes their outputs in order to produce its own output. Our model effectively combines previous skill-sets, does not suffer from forgetting, and is fully differentiable. We test our model in learning a set of visual reasoning tasks, and demonstrate improved performances in all tasks by learning progressively. By evaluating the reasoning process using human judges, we show that our model is more interpretable than an attention-based baseline.
10	We tackle the problem of modeling sequential visual phenomena. Given examples of a phenomena that can be divided into discrete time steps, we aim to take an input from any such time and realize this input at all other time steps in the sequence. Furthermore, we aim to do this \textit{without} ground-truth aligned sequences --- avoiding the difficulties needed for gathering aligned data. This generalizes the unpaired image-to-image problem from generating pairs to generating sequences. We extend cycle consistency to \textit{loop consistency} and alleviate difficulties associated with learning in the resulting long chains of computation. We show competitive results compared to existing image-to-image techniques when modeling several different data sets including the Earth's seasons and aging of human faces.
10	In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting samples that are not drawn from the training distribution, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, in classification. Many previous studies have attempted to solve this problem by regarding samples with low classification confidence as OOD examples using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, on difficult datasets or models with low classification ability, these methods incorrectly regard in-distribution samples close to the decision boundary as OOD samples. This problem arises because their approaches use only the features close to the output layer and disregard the uncertainty of the features. Therefore, we propose a method that extracts the uncertainties of features in each layer of DNNs using a reparameterization trick and combines them. In experiments, our method outperforms the existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance on several datasets and classification models. For example, our method increases the AUROC score of prior work (83.8%) to 99.8% in DenseNet on the CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.
10	We propose Noisy Information Bottlenecks (NIB) to limit mutual information between learned parameters and the data through noise. We show why this benefits generalization and allows mitigation of model overfitting both for supervised and unsupervised learning, even for arbitrarily complex architectures. We reinterpret methods including the Variational Autoencoder, beta-VAE, network weight uncertainty and a variant of dropout combined with weight decay as special cases of our approach, explaining and quantifying regularizing properties and vulnerabilities within information theory.
10	In reinforcement learning (RL) research, it is common to assume access to direct online interactions with the environment. However in many real-world applications, access to the environment is limited to a fixed offline dataset of logged experience. In such settings, standard RL algorithms have been shown to diverge or otherwise yield poor performance.  Accordingly, much recent work has suggested a number of remedies to these issues.  In this work, we introduce a general framework, behavior regularized actor critic (BRAC), to empirically evaluate recently proposed methods  as well as a number of simple baselines across a variety of offline continuous control tasks. Surprisingly, we find that many of the technical complexities introduced in recent methods are unnecessary to achieve strong performance. Additional ablations provide insights into which design choices matter most in the offline RL setting.
10	To perform robot manipulation tasks, a low-dimensional state of the environment typically needs to be estimated. However, designing a state estimator can sometimes be difficult, especially in environments with deformable objects. An alternative is to learn an end-to-end policy that maps directly from high-dimensional sensor inputs to actions. However, if this policy is trained with reinforcement learning, then without a state estimator, it is hard to specify a reward function based on high-dimensional observations. To meet this challenge, we propose a simple indicator reward function for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning: we only give a positive reward when the robot's observation exactly matches a target goal observation. We show that by relabeling the original goal with the achieved goal to obtain positive rewards (Andrychowicz et al., 2017), we can learn with the indicator reward function even in continuous state spaces. We propose two methods to further speed up convergence with indicator rewards: reward balancing and reward filtering. We show comparable performance between our method and an oracle which uses the ground-truth state for computing rewards. We show that our method can perform complex tasks in continuous state spaces such as rope manipulation from RGB-D images, without knowledge of the ground-truth state.
10	Existing methods for AI-generated artworks still struggle with generating high-quality stylized content, where high-level semantics are preserved, or separating fine-grained styles from various artists. We propose a novel Generative Adversarial Disentanglement Network which can disentangle two complementary factors of variations when only one of them is labelled in general, and fully decompose complex anime illustrations into style and content in particular. Training such model is challenging, since given a style, various content data may exist but not the other way round. Our approach is divided into two stages, one that encodes an input image into a style independent content, and one based on a dual-conditional generator. We demonstrate the ability to generate high-fidelity anime portraits with a fixed content and a large variety of styles from over a thousand artists, and vice versa, using a single end-to-end network and with applications in style transfer. We show this unique capability as well as superior output to the current state-of-the-art.
10	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received tremendous attention recently due to their power in handling graph data for different downstream tasks across different application domains. The key of GNN is its graph convolutional filters, and recently various kinds of filters are designed. However, there still lacks in-depth analysis on (1) Whether there exists a best filter that can perform best on all graph data; (2) Which graph properties will influence the optimal choice of graph filter; (3) How to design appropriate filter adaptive to the graph data. In this paper, we focus on addressing the above three questions. We first propose a novel assessment tool to evaluate the effectiveness of graph convolutional filters for a given graph. Using the assessment tool, we find out that there is no single filter as a `silver bullet' that perform the best on all possible graphs. In addition, different graph structure properties will influence the optimal graph convolutional filter's design choice. Based on these findings, we develop Adaptive Filter Graph Neural Network (AFGNN), a simple but powerful model that can adaptively learn task-specific filter. For a given graph, it leverages graph filter assessment as regularization and learns to combine from a set of base filters. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can indeed learn an appropriate filter and perform well on graph tasks.
01	In this paper, we study the implicit regularization of the gradient descent algorithm in homogeneous neural networks, including fully-connected and convolutional neural networks with ReLU or LeakyReLU activations. In particular, we study the gradient descent or gradient flow (i.e., gradient descent with infinitesimal step size) optimizing the logistic loss or cross-entropy loss of any homogeneous model (possibly non-smooth), and show that if the training loss decreases below a certain threshold, then we can define a smoothed version of the normalized margin which increases over time. We also formulate a natural constrained optimization problem related to margin maximization, and prove that both the normalized margin and its smoothed version converge to the objective value at a KKT point of the optimization problem. Our results generalize the previous results for logistic regression with one-layer or multi-layer linear networks, and provide more quantitative convergence results with weaker assumptions than previous results for homogeneous smooth neural networks. We conduct several experiments to justify our theoretical finding on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Finally, as margin is closely related to robustness, we discuss potential benefits of training longer for improving the robustness of the model.
10	Our work offers a new method for domain translation from semantic label mapsand Computer Graphic (CG) simulation edge map images to photo-realistic im-ages. We train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in a conditional way togenerate a photo-realistic version of a given CG scene. Existing architectures ofGANs still lack the photo-realism capabilities needed to train DNNs for computervision tasks, we address this issue by embedding edge maps, and training it in anadversarial mode. We also offer an extension to our model that uses our GANarchitecture to create visually appealing and temporally coherent videos.
01	We present sketch-rnn, a recurrent neural network able to construct stroke-based drawings of common objects. The model is trained on a dataset of human-drawn images representing many different classes. We outline a framework for conditional and unconditional sketch generation, and describe new robust training methods for generating coherent sketch drawings in a vector format.
10	Inspired by the combination of feedforward and iterative computations in the visual cortex, and taking advantage of the ability of denoising autoencoders to estimate the score of a joint distribution, we propose a novel approach to iterative inference for capturing and exploiting the complex joint distribution of output variables conditioned on some input variables. This approach is applied to image pixel-wise segmentation, with the estimated conditional score used to perform gradient ascent towards a mode of the estimated conditional distribution. This extends previous work on score estimation by denoising autoencoders to the case of a conditional distribution, with a novel use of a corrupted feedforward predictor replacing Gaussian corruption. An advantage of this approach over more classical ways to perform iterative inference for structured outputs, like conditional random fields (CRFs), is that it is not any more necessary to define an explicit energy function linking the output variables. To keep computations tractable, such energy function parametrizations are typically fairly constrained, involving only a few neighbors of each of the output variables in each clique. We experimentally find that the proposed iterative inference from conditional score estimation by conditional denoising autoencoders performs better than comparable models based on CRFs or those not using any explicit modeling of the conditional joint distribution of outputs.
10	Variational Bayesian Inference is a popular methodology for approximating posterior distributions in Bayesian neural networks. Recent work developing this class of methods has explored ever richer parameterizations of the approximate posterior in the hope of improving performance. In contrast, here we share a curious experimental finding that suggests instead restricting the variational distribution to a more compact parameterization. For a variety of deep Bayesian neural networks trained using Gaussian mean-field variational inference, we find that the posterior standard deviations consistently exhibits strong low-rank structure after convergence. This means that by decomposing these variational parameters into a low-rank factorization, we can make our variational approximation more compact without decreasing the models' performance. What's more, we find that such factorized parameterizations are easier to train since they improve the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradient estimates of the variational lower bound, resulting in faster convergence.
10	Training reinforcement learning policies in partially observable domains with sparse reward signal is an important and open problem for the research community. In this paper, we introduce a new sequence-level intrinsic novelty model to tackle the challenge of training reinforcement learning policies in sparse rewarded partially observable domains. First, we propose a new reasoning paradigm to infer the novelty for the partially observable states, which is built upon forward dynamics prediction. Different from conventional approaches that perform self-prediction or one-step forward prediction, our proposed approach engages open-loop multi-step prediction, which enables the difficulty of novelty prediction to flexibly scale and thus results in high-quality novelty scores. Second, we propose a novel dual-LSTM architecture to facilitate the sequence-level reasoning over the partially observable state space.  Our proposed architecture efficiently synthesizes information from an observation sequence and an action sequence to derive meaningful latent representations for inferring the novelty for states. To evaluate the efficiency of our proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on several challenging 3D navigation tasks from ViZDoom and DeepMind Lab. We also present results on two hard-exploration domains from Atari 2600 series in Appendix to demonstrate our proposed approach could generalize beyond partially observable navigation tasks. Overall, the experiment results reveal that our proposed intrinsic novelty model could outperform several state-of-the-art curiosity baselines with considerable significance in the testified domains.
10	We introduce a new normalization technique that exhibits the fast convergence properties of batch normalization using a transformation of layer weights instead of layer outputs. The proposed technique keeps the contribution of positive and negative weights to the layer output in equilibrium. We validate our method on a set of standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10/100, SVHN and ILSVRC 2012 ImageNet.
01	Structured prediction energy networks (SPENs; Belanger & McCallum 2016) use neural network architectures to define energy functions that can capture arbitrary dependencies among parts of structured outputs. Prior work used gradient descent for inference, relaxing the structured output to a set of continuous variables and then optimizing the energy with respect to them. We replace this use of gradient descent with a neural network trained to approximate structured argmax inference. This“inference network” outputs continuous values that we treat as the output structure. We develop large-margin training criteria for joint training of the structured energy function and inference network. On multi-label classification we report speed-upsof 10-60x compared to (Belanger et al., 2017) while also improving accuracy. For sequence labeling with simple structured energies, our approach performs comparably to exact inference while being much faster at test time. We then demonstrate improved accuracy by augmenting the energy with a “label language model” that scores entire output label sequences, showing it can improve handling of long-distance dependencies in part-of-speech tagging. Finally, we show how inference networks can replace dynamic programming for test-time inference in conditional random fields, suggestive for their general use for fast inference in structured settings.
01	Understanding the loss surface of a neural network is fundamentally important to the understanding of deep learning. This paper presents how piecewise linear activation functions substantially shape the loss surfaces of neural networks. We first prove that {\it the loss surfaces of many neural networks have infinite spurious local minima} which are defined as the local minima with higher empirical risks than the global minima. Our result demonstrates that the networks with piecewise linear activations possess substantial differences to the well-studied linear neural networks. This result holds for any neural network with arbitrary depth and arbitrary piecewise linear activation functions (excluding linear functions) under most loss functions in practice. Essentially, the underlying assumptions are consistent with most practical circumstances where the output layer is narrower than any hidden layer. In addition, the loss surface of a neural network with piecewise linear activations is partitioned into multiple smooth and multilinear cells by nondifferentiable boundaries. The constructed spurious local minima are concentrated in one cell as a valley: they are connected with each other by a continuous path, on which empirical risk is invariant. Further for one-hidden-layer networks, we prove that all local minima in a cell constitute an equivalence class; they are concentrated in a valley; and they are all global minima in the cell.
10	We present a new family of objective functions, which we term the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB). These objectives are motivated by the Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) criterion. We demonstrate the application of CEB to classification tasks. We show that CEB gives: well-calibrated predictions; strong detection of challenging out-of-distribution examples and powerful whitebox adversarial examples; and substantial robustness to those adversaries. Finally, we report that CEB fails to learn from information-free datasets, providing a possible resolution to the problem of generalization observed in Zhang et al. (2016).
10	We consider the following central question in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL): How can we use implicit human feedback to accelerate and optimize the training of a DRL algorithm? State-of-the-art methods rely on any human feedback to be provided explicitly, requiring the active participation of humans (e.g., expert labeling, demonstrations, etc.). In this work, we investigate an alternative paradigm, where non-expert humans are silently observing (and assessing) the agent interacting with the environment. The human's intrinsic reactions to the agent's behavior is sensed as implicit feedback by placing electrodes on the human scalp and monitoring what are known as event-related electric potentials. The implicit feedback is then used to augment the agent's learning in the RL tasks. We develop a system to obtain and accurately decode the implicit human feedback (specifically error-related event potentials) for state-action pairs in an Atari-type environment. As a baseline contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of capturing error-potentials  of a human observer watching an agent learning to play several different Atari-games using an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap, and then decoding the signals appropriately and using them as an auxiliary reward function to a DRL algorithm with the intent of accelerating its learning of the game. Building atop the baseline, we then make the following novel contributions in our work:(i) We argue that the definition of error-potentials is generalizable across different environments; specifically we show that error-potentials of an observer can be learned for a specific game, and the definition used as-is for another game without requiring re-learning of the error-potentials.  (ii) We propose two different frameworks to combine recent advances in DRL into the error-potential based feedback system in a sample-efficient manner, allowing humans to provide implicit feedback while training in the loop, or prior to the training of the RL agent.(iii) Finally, we scale the implicit human feedback (via ErrP) based RL to reasonably complex environments (games) and demonstrate the significance of our approach through synthetic and real user experiments.
10	Recent work in network quantization has substantially reduced the time and space complexity of neural network inference, enabling their deployment on embedded and mobile devices with limited computational and memory resources. However, existing quantization methods often represent all weights and activations with the same precision (bit-width). In this paper, we explore a new dimension of the design space: quantizing different layers with different bit-widths. We formulate this problem as a neural architecture search problem and propose a novel differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework to efficiently explore its exponential search space with gradient-based optimization. Experiments show we surpass the state-of-the-art compression of ResNet on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Our quantized models with 21.1x smaller model size or 103.9x lower computational cost can still outperform baseline quantized or even full precision models.
10	Adaptive moment methods have been remarkably successful for optimization under the presence of high dimensional or sparse gradients, in parallel to this, adaptive sampling probabilities for SGD have allowed optimizers to improve convergence rates by prioritizing examples to learn efficiently. Numerous applications in the past have implicitly combined adaptive moment methods with adaptive probabilities yet the theoretical guarantees of such procedures have not been explored. We formalize double adaptive stochastic gradient methods DASGrad as an optimization technique and analyze its convergence improvements in a stochastic convex optimization setting, we provide empirical validation of our findings with convex and non convex objectives. We observe that the benefits of the method increase with the model complexity and variability of the gradients, and we explore the resulting utility in extensions to transfer learning. 
01	We propose a novel, projection based way to incorporate the conditional information into the discriminator of GANs that respects the role of the conditional information in the underlining probabilistic model. This approach is in contrast with most frameworks of conditional GANs used in application today, which use the conditional information by concatenating the (embedded) conditional vector to the feature vectors. With this modification, we were able to significantly improve the quality of the class conditional image generation on ILSVRC2012 (ImageNet) dataset from the current state-of-the-art result, and we achieved this with a single pair of a discriminator and a generator. We were also able to extend the application to super-resolution and succeeded in producing highly discriminative super-resolution images. This new structure also enabled high quality category transformation based on parametric functional transformation of conditional batch normalization layers in the generator.
10	We consider the problem of improving kernel approximation via feature maps. These maps arise as Monte Carlo approximation to integral representations of kernel functions and scale up kernel methods for larger datasets. We propose to use more efficient numerical integration technique to obtain better estimates of the integrals compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Our approach allows to use information about the integrand to enhance approximation and facilitates fast computations. We derive the convergence behavior and conduct an extensive empirical study that supports our hypothesis.
01	Neural program synthesis from input-output examples has attracted an increasing interest from both the machine learning and the programming language community. Most existing neural program synthesis approaches employ an encoder-decoder architecture, which uses an encoder to compute the embedding of the given input-output examples, as well as a decoder to generate the program from the embedding following a given syntax. Although such approaches achieve a reasonable performance on simple tasks such as FlashFill, on more complex tasks such as Karel, the state-of-the-art approach can only achieve an accuracy of around 77%. We observe that the main drawback of existing approaches is that the semantic information is greatly under-utilized. In this work, we propose two simple yet principled techniques to better leverage the semantic information, which are execution-guided synthesis and synthesizer ensemble. These techniques are general enough to be combined with any existing encoder-decoder-style neural program synthesizer. Applying our techniques to the Karel dataset, we can boost the accuracy from around 77% to more than 90%.
10	Recent studies in attention modules have enabled higher performance in computer vision tasks by capturing global contexts and accordingly attending important features. In this paper, we propose a simple and highly parametrically efficient module named Tree-structured Attention Module (TAM) which recursively encourages neighboring channels to collaborate in order to produce a spatial attention map as an output. Unlike other attention modules which try to capture long-range dependencies at each channel, our module focuses on imposing non-linearities be- tween channels by utilizing point-wise group convolution. This module not only strengthens representational power of a model but also acts as a gate which controls signal flow. Our module allows a model to achieve higher performance in a highly parameter-efficient manner. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our module with extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN datasets. With our proposed attention module employed, ResNet50 and ResNet101 models gain 2.3% and 1.2% accuracy improvement with less than 1.5% parameter over- head. Our PyTorch implementation code is publicly available.
10	It is important to collect credible training samples $(x,y)$ for building data-intensive learning systems (e.g., a deep learning system). In the literature, there is a line of studies on eliciting distributional information from self-interested agents who hold a relevant information.  Asking people to report complex distribution $p(x)$, though theoretically viable, is challenging in practice. This is primarily due to the heavy cognitive loads required for human agents to reason and report this high dimensional information. Consider the example where we are interested in building an image classifier via first collecting a certain category of  high-dimensional image data. While classical elicitation results apply to eliciting a complex and generative (and continuous) distribution $p(x)$ for this image data, we are interested in eliciting samples $x_i \sim p(x)$ from agents. This paper introduces a deep learning aided method to incentivize credible sample contributions from selfish and rational agents. The challenge to do so is to design an incentive-compatible score function to score each reported sample to induce truthful reports, instead of an arbitrary or even adversarial one. We show that with accurate estimation of a certain $f$-divergence function we are able to achieve approximate incentive compatibility in eliciting truthful samples. We then present an efficient estimator with theoretical guarantee via studying the variational forms of $f$-divergence function. Our work complements the literature of information elicitation via introducing the problem of \emph{sample elicitation}.  We also show a connection between this sample elicitation problem and $f$-GAN, and how this connection can help reconstruct an estimator of the distribution based on collected samples.
10	State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) typically have tens of millions of parameters, which might not fit into the upper levels of the memory hierarchy, thus increasing the inference time and energy consumption significantly, and prohibiting their use on edge devices such as mobile phones. The compression of DNN models has therefore become an active area of research recently, with \emph{connection pruning} emerging as one of the most successful strategies. A very natural approach is to prune connections of DNNs via $\ell_1$ regularization, but recent empirical investigations have suggested that this does not work as well in the context of DNN compression. In this work, we revisit this simple strategy and analyze it rigorously, to show that: (a) any \emph{stationary point} of an $\ell_1$-regularized layerwise-pruning objective has its number of non-zero elements bounded by the number of penalized prediction logits, regardless of the strength of the regularization; (b) successful pruning highly relies on an accurate optimization solver, and there is a trade-off between compression speed and distortion of prediction accuracy, controlled by the strength of regularization. Our theoretical results thus suggest that $\ell_1$ pruning could be successful provided we use an accurate optimization solver. We corroborate this in our experiments, where we show that simple $\ell_1$ regularization with an Adamax-L1(cumulative) solver gives pruning ratio competitive to the state-of-the-art.
10	Variational autoencoders (VAEs) defined over SMILES string and graph-based representations of molecules promise to improve the optimization of molecular properties, thereby revolutionizing the pharmaceuticals and materials industries. However, these VAEs are hindered by the non-unique nature of SMILES strings and the computational cost of graph convolutions. To efficiently pass messages along all paths through the molecular graph, we encode multiple SMILES strings of a single molecule using a set of stacked recurrent neural networks, harmonizing hidden representations of each atom between SMILES representations, and use attentional pooling to build a final fixed-length latent representation. By then decoding to a disjoint set of SMILES strings of the molecule, our All SMILES VAE learns an almost bijective mapping between molecules and latent representations near the high-probability-mass subspace of the prior. Our SMILES-derived but molecule-based latent representations significantly surpass the state-of-the-art in a variety of fully- and semi-supervised property regression and molecular property optimization tasks.
10	We consider the problem of fair and robust model training in the presence of data poisoning. Ensuring fairness usually involves a tradeoff against accuracy, so if the data poisoning is mistakenly viewed as additional bias to be fixed, the accuracy will be sacrificed even more. We demonstrate that this phenomenon indeed holds for state-of-the-art model fairness techniques. We then propose FR-GAN, which holistically performs fair and robust model training using generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first use a generator that attempts to classify examples as accurately as possible. In addition, we deploy two discriminators: (1) a fairness discriminator that predicts the sensitive attribute from classification results and (2) a robustness discriminator that distinguishes examples and predictions from a clean validation set. Our framework respects all the prominent fairness measures: disparate impact, equalized odds, and equal opportunity. Also, FR-GAN optimizes fairness without requiring the knowledge of prior statistics of the sensitive attributes. In our experiments, FR-GAN shows almost no decrease in fairness and accuracy in the presence of data poisoning unlike other state-of-the-art fairness methods, which are vulnerable. In addition, FR-GAN can be adjusted using parameters to maintain reasonable accuracy and fairness even if the validation set is too small or unavailable.
10	Unsupervised representation learning holds the promise of exploiting large amount of available unlabeled data to learn general representations. A promising technique for unsupervised learning is the framework of Variational Auto-encoders (VAEs). However, unsupervised representations learned by VAEs are significantly outperformed by those learned by supervising for recognition. Our hypothesis is that to learn useful representations for recognition the model needs to be encouraged to learn about repeating and consistent patterns in data. Drawing inspiration from the mid-level representation discovery work, we propose PatchVAE, that reasons about images at patch level. Our key contribution is a bottleneck formulation in a VAE framework that encourages mid-level style representations. Our experiments demonstrate that representations learned by our method perform much better on the recognition tasks compared to those learned by vanilla VAEs.
10	Deep reinforcement learning requires a heavy price in terms of sample efficiency and overparameterization in the neural networks used for function approximation. In this work, we employ tensor factorization in order to learn more compact representations for reinforcement learning policies. We show empirically that in the low-data regime, it is possible to learn online policies with 2 to 10 times less total coefficients, with little to no loss of performance. We also leverage progress in second order optimization, and use the theory of wavelet scattering to further reduce the number of learned coefficients, by foregoing learning the topmost convolutional layer filters altogether. We evaluate our results on the Atari suite against recent baseline algorithms that represent the state-of-the-art in data efficiency, and get comparable results with an order of magnitude gain in weight parsimony.
01	This paper presents a phenomenon in neural networks that we refer to as local elasticity. Roughly speaking, a classifier is said to be locally elastic if its prediction at a feature vector x' is not significantly perturbed, after the classifier is updated via stochastic gradient descent at a (labeled) feature vector x that is dissimilar to x' in a certain sense. This phenomenon is shown to persist for neural networks with nonlinear activation functions through extensive simulations on real-life and synthetic datasets, whereas this is not observed in linear classifiers. In addition, we offer a geometric interpretation of local elasticity using the neural tangent kernel (Jacot et al., 2018). Building on top of local elasticity, we obtain pairwise similarity measures between feature vectors, which can be used for clustering in conjunction with K-means. The effectiveness of the clustering algorithm on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in turn corroborates the hypothesis of local elasticity of neural networks on real-life data. Finally, we discuss some implications of local elasticity to shed light on several intriguing aspects of deep neural networks.
10	Many methods have been developed to represent knowledge graph data, which implicitly exploit low-rank latent structure in the data to encode known information and enable unknown facts to be inferred. To predict whether a relationship holds between entities, their embeddings are typically compared in the latent space following a relation-specific mapping. Whilst link prediction has steadily improved, the latent structure, and hence why such models capture semantic information, remains unexplained. We build on recent theoretical interpretation of word embeddings as a basis to consider an explicit structure for representations of relations between entities. For identifiable relation types, we are able to predict properties and justify the relative performance of leading knowledge graph representation methods, including their often overlooked ability to make independent predictions.
10	Stochastic neural networks (SNNs) are currently topical, with several paradigms being actively investigated including dropout, Bayesian neural networks, variational information bottleneck (VIB) and noise regularized learning. These neural network variants impact several major considerations, including generalization, network compression, and robustness against adversarial attack and label noise. However, many existing networks are complicated and expensive to train, and/or only address one or two of these practical considerations. In this paper we propose a simple and effective stochastic neural network (SE-SNN) architecture for discriminative learning by directly modeling activation uncertainty and encouraging high activation variability. Compared to existing SNNs, our SE-SNN is simpler to implement and faster to train, and produces state of the art results on network compression by pruning,  adversarial defense and learning with label noise.
01	We study the problem of learning similarity functions over very large corpora using neural network embedding models. These models are typically trained using SGD with random sampling of unobserved pairs, with a sample size that grows quadratically with the corpus size, making it expensive to scale.We propose new efficient methods to train these models without having to sample unobserved pairs. Inspired by matrix factorization, our approach relies on adding a global quadratic penalty and expressing this term as the inner-product of two generalized Gramians. We show that the gradient of this term can be efficiently computed by maintaining estimates of the Gramians, and develop variance reduction schemes to improve the quality of the estimates. We conduct large-scale experiments that show a significant improvement both in training time and generalization performance compared to sampling methods.
10	There is a stark disparity between the learning rate schedules used in the practice of large scale machine learning and what are considered admissible learning rate schedules prescribed in the theory of stochastic approximation. Recent results, such as in the 'super-convergence' methods which use oscillating learning rates, serve to emphasize this point even more.One plausible explanation is that non-convex neural network training procedures are better suited to the use of fundamentally different learning rate  schedules, such as the ``cut the learning rate every constant number of epochs'' method (which more closely resembles an exponentially decaying learning rate schedule); note that this widely used schedule is in stark contrast to the polynomial decay schemes prescribed in the stochastic approximation literature, which are indeed shown to be (worst case) optimal for classes of convex optimization problems.The main contribution of this work shows that the picture is far more nuanced, where we do not even need to move to non-convex optimization to show other learning rate schemes can be far more effective. In fact, even for the simple case of stochastic linear regression with a fixed time horizon, the rate achieved by any polynomial decay scheme is sub-optimal compared to the statistical minimax rate (by a factor of condition number); in contrast the ```''cut the learning rate every constant number of epochs'' provides an exponential improvement (depending only logarithmically on the condition number) compared to any polynomial decay scheme.  Finally, it is important to ask if our theoretical insights are somehow fundamentally tied to quadratic loss minimization (where we have circumvented minimax lower bounds for more general convex optimization problems)? Here, we conjecture that recent results which make the gradient norm small at a near optimal rate, for both convex and non-convex optimization, may also provide more insights into learning rate schedules used in practice.
10	Deep convolutional  neural networks are known to specialize in distilling compact and robust prior from a large amount of data. We are interested in applying deep networks in the absence of training dataset. In this paper, we introduce deep audio prior (DAP)  which leverages the structure of a network and the temporal information in a single audio file. Specifically, we demonstrate that a randomly-initialized neural network can be used with carefully designed audio prior to tackle challenging audio problems such as universal blind source separation, interactive audio editing, audio texture synthesis, and audio co-separation.To understand the robustness of the deep audio prior, we construct a benchmark dataset Universal-150 for universal sound source separation with a diverse set of sources. We show superior audio results than previous work on both qualitatively and quantitative evaluations. We also perform thorough ablation study to validate our design choices.
10	This paper proposes a new model for document embedding. Existing approaches either require complex inference or use recurrent neural networks that are difficult to parallelize. We take a different route and use recent advances in language modeling to develop a convolutional neural network embedding model. This allows us to train deeper architectures that are fully parallelizable. Stacking layers together increases the receptive filed allowing each successive layer to model increasingly longer range semantic dependences within the document. Empirically we demonstrate superior results on two publicly available benchmarks. Full code will be released with the final version of this paper.
10	We propose laconic classification as a novel way to understand and compare the performance of diverse image classifiers. The goal in this setting is to minimise the amount of information (aka. entropy) required in individual test images to maintain correct classification. Given a classifier and a test image, we compute an approximate minimal-entropy positive image for which the classifier provides a correct classification, becoming incorrect upon any further reduction. The notion of entropy offers a unifying metric that allows to combine and compare the effects of various types of reductions (e.g., crop, colour reduction, resolution reduction) on classification performance, in turn generalising similar methods explored in previous works. Proposing two complementary frameworks for computing the minimal-entropy positive images of both human and machine classifiers, in experiments over the ILSVRC test-set, we find that machine classifiers are more sensitive entropy-wise to reduced resolution (versus cropping or reduced colour for machines, as well as reduced resolution for humans), supporting recent results suggesting a texture bias in the ILSVRC-trained models used. We also find, in the evaluated setting, that humans classify the minimal-entropy positive images of machine models with higher precision than machines classify those of humans.
10	Asynchronous distributed methods are a popular way to reduce the communication and synchronization costs of large-scale optimization. Yet, for all their success, little is known about their convergence guarantees in the challenging case of general non-smooth, non-convex objectives, beyond cases where closed-form proximal operator solutions are available.This is all the more surprising since these objectives are the ones appearing in the training of deep neural networks.In this paper, we introduce the first convergence analysis covering asynchronous methods in the case of general non-smooth, non-convex objectives. Our analysis applies to stochastic sub-gradient descent methods both with and without block variable partitioning, and both with and without momentum. It is phrased in the context of a general probabilistic model of asynchronous scheduling accurately adapted to modern hardware properties. We validate our analysis experimentally in the context of training deep neural network architectures. We show their overall successful asymptotic convergence as well as exploring how momentum, synchronization, and partitioning all affect performance.
01	Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is a powerful and practical approach for learning sequential decision-making policies. Different from Reinforcement Learning (RL), GAIL takes advantage of demonstration data by experts (e.g., human), and learns both the policy and reward function of the unknown environment. Despite the significant empirical progresses, the theory behind GAIL is still largely unknown. The major difficulty comes from the underlying temporal dependency of the demonstration data and the minimax computational formulation of GAIL without convex-concave structure. To bridge such a gap between theory and practice, this paper investigates the theoretical properties of GAIL. Specifically, we show: (1) For GAIL with general reward parameterization, the generalization can be guaranteed as long as the class of the reward functions is properly controlled; (2) For GAIL, where the reward is parameterized as a reproducing kernel function, GAIL can be efficiently solved by stochastic first order optimization algorithms, which attain sublinear convergence to a stationary solution. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results on statistical and computational guarantees of imitation learning with reward/policy function ap- proximation. Numerical experiments are provided to support our analysis.
10	In this paper, we propose a nonlinear unsupervised metric learning framework to boost of the performance of clustering algorithms. Under our framework, nonlinear distance metric learning and manifold embedding are integrated and conducted simultaneously to increase the natural separations among data samples. The metric learning component is implemented through feature space transformations, regulated by a nonlinear deformable model called Coherent Point Drifting (CPD). Driven by CPD, data points can get to a higher level of linear separability, which is subsequently picked up by the manifold embedding component to generate well-separable sample projections for clustering. Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art solutions in unsupervised metric learning.
01	Natural question generation (QG) aims to generate questions from a passage and an answer. Previous works on QG either (i) ignore the rich structure information hidden in text, (ii) solely rely on cross-entropy loss that leads to issues like exposure bias and inconsistency between train/test measurement, or (iii) fail to fully exploit the answer information. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based graph-to-sequence (Graph2Seq) model for QG. Our model consists of a Graph2Seq generator with a novel Bidirectional Gated Graph Neural Network based encoder to embed the passage, and a hybrid evaluator with a mixed objective combining both cross-entropy and RL losses to ensure the generation of syntactically and semantically valid text. We also introduce an effective Deep Alignment Network for incorporating the answer information into the passage at both the word and contextual levels. Our model is end-to-end trainable and achieves new state-of-the-art scores, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin on the standard SQuAD benchmark.
01	We propose a simple yet highly effective method that addresses the mode-collapse problem in the Conditional Generative  Adversarial  Network (cGAN). Although conditional distributions are multi-modal (i.e., having many modes) in practice, most cGAN approaches tend to learn an overly simplified distribution where an input is always mapped to a single output regardless of variations in latent code. To address such issue, we propose to explicitly regularize the generator to produce diverse outputs depending on latent codes. The proposed regularization is simple, general, and can be easily integrated into most conditional GAN objectives. Additionally, explicit regularization on generator allows our method to control a balance between visual quality and diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three conditional generation tasks: image-to-image translation, image inpainting, and future video prediction. We show that simple addition of our regularization to existing models leads to surprisingly diverse generations, substantially outperforming the previous approaches for multi-modal conditional generation specifically designed in each individual task.
10	A fundamental goal in deep learning is the characterization of trainability and generalization of neural networks as a function of their architecture and hyperparameters. In this paper, we discuss these challenging issues in the context of wide neural networks at large depths where we will see that the situation simplifies considerably. To do this, we leverage recent advances that have separately shown: (1) that in the wide network limit, random networks before training are Gaussian Processes governed by a kernel known as the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel, (2) that at large depths the spectrum of the NNGP kernel simplifies considerably and becomes ``weakly data-dependent'', and (3) that gradient descent training of wide neural networks is described by a kernel called the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) that is related to the NNGP. Here we show that by combining the in the large depth limit the spectrum of the NTK simplifies in much the same way as that of the NNGP kernel. By analyzing this spectrum, we arrive at a precise characterization of trainability and generalization across a range of architectures including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We find that there are large regions of hyperparameter space where networks will train but will fail to generalize, in contrast with several recent results. By comparing CNNs with- and without-global average pooling, we show that CNNs without average pooling have very nearly identical learning dynamics to FCNs while CNNs with pooling contain a correction that alters its generalization performance. We perform a thorough empirical investigation of these theoretical results and finding excellent agreement on real datasets.
10	This paper proposes a new method to drastically speed up deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) training for problems that have the property of \textit{state-action permissibility} (SAP). Two types of permissibility are defined under SAP. The first type says that after an action $a_t$ is performed in a state $s_t$ and the agent reaches the new state $s_{t+1}$, the agent can decide whether the action $a_t$ is \textit{permissible} or \textit{not permissible} in state $s_t$. The second type says that even without performing the action $a_t$ in state $s_t$, the agent can already decide whether $a_t$ is permissible or not in $s_t$. An action is not permissible in a state if the action can never lead to an optimal solution and thus should not be tried. We incorporate the proposed SAP property into two state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms to guide their state-action exploration. Results show that the SAP guidance can markedly speed up training.
10	The incorporation of prior knowledge into learning is essential in achieving good performance based on small noisy samples. Such knowledge is often incorporated through the availability of related data arising from domains and tasks similar to the one of current interest. Ideally one would like to allow both the data for the current task and for previous related tasks to self-organize the learning system in such a way that commonalities and differences between the tasks are learned in a data-driven fashion. We develop a framework for learning multiple tasks simultaneously, based on sharing features that are common to all tasks, achieved through the use of a modular deep feedforward neural network consisting of shared branches, dealing with the common features of all tasks, and private branches, learning the specific unique aspects of each task. Once an appropriate weight sharing architecture has been established, learning takes place through standard algorithms for feedforward networks, e.g., stochastic gradient descent and its variations. The method deals with meta-learning (such as domain adaptation, transfer and multi-task learning) in a unified fashion, and can easily deal with data arising from different types of sources. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of learning in domain adaptation and transfer learning setups, and provide evidence for the flexible and task-oriented representations arising in the network.
10	Answering questions about data can require understanding what parts of an input X influence the response Y. Finding such an understanding can be built by testing relationships between variables through a machine learning model. For example, conditional randomization tests help determine whether a variable relates to the response given the rest of the variables. However, randomization tests require users to specify test statistics. We formalize a class of proper test statistics that are guaranteed to select a feature when it provides information about the response even when the rest of the features are known. We show that f-divergences provide a broad class of proper test statistics. In the class of f-divergences, the KL-divergence yields an easy-to-compute proper test statistic that relates to the AMI. Questions of feature importance can be asked at the level of an individual sample.  We show that estimators from the same AMI test can also be used to find important features in a particular instance. We provide an example to show that perfect predictive models are insufficient for instance-wise feature selection. We evaluate our method on several simulation experiments, on a genomic dataset, a clinical dataset for hospital readmission, and on a subset of classes in ImageNet. Our method outperforms several baselines in various simulated datasets, is able to identify biologically significant genes, can select the most important predictors of a hospital readmission event, and is able to identify distinguishing features in an image-classification task. 
01	We present a learning-based approach to detect and fix a broad range of bugs in Javascript programs. We frame the problem in terms of learning a sequence of graph transformations: given a buggy program modeled by a graph structure, our model makes a sequence of predictions including the position of bug nodes and corresponding graph edits to produce a fix. Unlike previous works that use deep neural networks, our approach targets bugs that are more complex and semantic in nature (i.e.~bugs that require adding or deleting statements to fix). We have realized our approach in a tool called HOPPITY. By training on 290,715 Javascript code change commits on Github, HOPPITY correctly detects and fixes bugs in 9,490 out of 36,361 programs in an end-to-end fashion. Given the bug location and type of the fix, HOPPITY also outperforms the baseline approach by a wide margin.
10	We introduce Neural Markov Logic Networks (NMLNs), a statistical relational learning system that borrows ideas from Markov logic. Like Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), NMLNs are an exponential-family model for modelling distributions over possible worlds, but unlike MLNs, they do not rely on explicitly specified first-order logic rules. Instead, NMLNs learn an implicit representation of such rules as a neural network that acts as a potential function on fragments of the relational structure. Interestingly, any MLN can be represented as an NMLN. Similarly to recently proposed Neural theorem provers (NTPs) (Rocktaschel at al. 2017), NMLNs can exploit embeddings of constants but, unlike NTPs, NMLNs work well also in their absence. This is extremely important for predicting in settings other than the transductive one. We showcase the potential of NMLNs on knowledge-base completion tasks and on generation of molecular (graph) data.
01	Progress in probabilistic generative models has accelerated, developing richer models with neural architectures, implicit densities, and with scalable algorithms for their Bayesian inference. However, there has been limited progress in models that capture causal relationships, for example, how individual genetic factors cause major human diseases. In this work, we focus on two challenges in particular: How do we build richer causal models, which can capture highly nonlinear relationships and interactions between multiple causes? How do we adjust for latent confounders, which are variables influencing both cause and effect and which prevent learning of causal relationships? To address these challenges, we synthesize ideas from causality and modern probabilistic modeling. For the first, we describe implicit causal models, a class of causal models that leverages neural architectures with an implicit density. For the second, we describe an implicit causal model that adjusts for confounders by sharing strength across examples. In experiments, we scale Bayesian inference on up to a billion genetic measurements. We achieve state of the art accuracy for identifying causal factors: we significantly outperform the second best result by an absolute difference of 15-45.3%.
10	Reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to effectively learn tasks in a variety of static, deterministic, and  simplistic environments, but their application to environments which are characteristic of dynamic lifelong settings encountered in the real world has been limited. Understanding the impact of specific environmental properties on the learning dynamics of reinforcement learning algorithms is important as we want to align the environments in which we develop our algorithms with the real world, and this is strongly coupled with the type of intelligence which can be learned. In this work, we study what we refer to as ecological reinforcement learning: the interaction between properties of the environment and the reinforcement learning agent. To this end, we introduce environments with characteristics that we argue better reflect natural environments: non-episodic learning, uninformative ``fundamental drive'' reward signals, and natural dynamics that cause the environment to change even when the agent fails to take intelligent actions. We show these factors can have a profound effect on the learning progress of reinforcement learning algorithms. Surprisingly, we find that these seemingly more challenging learning conditions can often make reinforcement learning agents learn more effectively. Through this study, we hope to shift the focus of the community towards learning in realistic, natural environments with dynamic elements.
01	While many option discovery methods have been proposed to accelerate exploration in reinforcement learning, they are often heuristic. Recently, covering options was proposed to discover a set of options that provably reduce the upper bound of the environment's cover time, a measure of the difficulty of exploration. Covering options are computed using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian, but they are constrained to tabular tasks and are not applicable to tasks with large or continuous state-spaces. We introduce deep covering options, an online method that extends covering options to large state spaces,  automatically discovering task-agnostic options that encourage exploration. We evaluate our method in several challenging sparse-reward domains and we show that our approach identifies less explored regions of the state-space and successfully generates options to visit these regions, substantially improving both the exploration and the total accumulated reward.
01	We consider  the use of Deep Learning methods for modeling complex phenomena like those occurring in natural physical processes. With the large amount of data gathered on these phenomena the data intensive paradigm could begin to challenge more traditional approaches elaborated over the years in fields like maths or physics. However, despite considerable successes in a variety of application domains, the machine learning field is not yet ready to handle the level of complexity required by such problems. Using an example application, namely Sea Surface Temperature Prediction, we show how general background knowledge gained from the physics could be used as a guideline for designing efficient Deep Learning models. In order to motivate the approach and to assess its generality we demonstrate a formal link between the solution of a class of differential equations underlying a large family of physical phenomena and the proposed model. Experiments and comparison with series of baselines including a state of the art numerical approach is then provided.
10	Neural language models have achieved great success in many NLP tasks, to a large extent, due to the ability to capture contextual dependencies among terms in a text. While many efforts have been devoted to empirically explain the connection between the network hyperparameters and the ability to represent the contextual dependency, the theoretical analysis is relatively insufficient. Inspired by the recent research on the use of tensor space to explain the neural network architecture, we explore the interpretable mechanism for neural language models. Specifically, we define the concept of separation rank in the language modeling process, in order to theoretically measure the degree of contextual dependencies in a sentence. Then, we show that the lower bound of such a separation rank can reveal the quantitative relation between the network structure (e.g. depth/width) and the modeling ability for the contextual dependency. Especially, increasing the depth of the neural network can be more effective to improve the ability of modeling contextual dependency. Therefore, it is important to design an adaptive network to compute the adaptive depth in a task. Inspired by Adaptive Computation Time (ACT), we design an adaptive recurrent network based on the separation rank to model contextual dependency. Experiments on various NLP tasks have verified the proposed theoretical analysis. We also test our adaptive recurrent neural network in the sentence classification task, and the experiments show that it can achieve better results than the traditional bidirectional LSTM.
10	We hypothesize that end-to-end neural image captioning systems work seemingly well because they exploit and learn ‘distributional similarity’ in a multimodal feature space, by mapping a test image to similar training images in this space and generating a caption from the same space. To validate our hypothesis, we focus on the ‘image’ side of image captioning, and vary the input image representation but keep the RNN text generation model of a CNN-RNN constant. We propose a sparse bag-of-objects vector as an interpretable representation to investigate our distributional similarity hypothesis. We found that image captioning models (i) are capable of separating structure from noisy input representations; (ii) experience virtually no significant performance loss when a high dimensional representation is compressed to a lower dimensional space; (iii) cluster images with similar visual and linguistic information together; (iv) are heavily reliant on test sets with a similar distribution as the training set; (v) repeatedly generate the same captions by matching images and ‘retrieving’ a caption in the joint visual-textual space. Our experiments all point to one fact: that our distributional similarity hypothesis holds. We conclude that, regardless of the image representation, image captioning systems seem to match images and generate captions in a learned joint image-text semantic subspace.
01	We address the problem of learning structured policies for continuous control. In traditional reinforcement learning, policies of agents are learned by MLPs which take the concatenation of all observations from the environment as input for predicting actions. In this work, we propose NerveNet to explicitly model the structure of an agent, which naturally takes the form of a graph. Specifically, serving as the agent's policy network, NerveNet first propagates information over the structure of the agent and then predict actions for different parts of the agent. In the experiments, we first show that our NerveNet is comparable to state-of-the-art methods on standard MuJoCo environments. We further propose our customized reinforcement learning environments for benchmarking two types of structure transfer learning tasks, i.e., size and disability transfer. We demonstrate that policies learned by NerveNet are significantly better than policies learned by other models and are able to transfer even in a zero-shot setting.
10	Existing unsupervised video-to-video translation methods fail to produce translated videos which are frame-wise realistic, semantic information preserving and video-level consistent. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised video-to-video translation model. Our model decomposes the style and the content, uses specialized encoder-decoder structure and propagates the inter-frame information through bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) units. The style-content decomposition mechanism enables us to achieve long-term style-consistent video translation results as well as provides us with a good interface for modality flexible translation. In addition, by changing the input frames and style codes incorporated in our translation, we propose a video interpolation loss, which captures temporal information within the sequence to train our building blocks in a self-supervised manner. Our model can produce photo-realistic, spatio-temporal consistent translated videos in a multimodal way. Subjective and objective experimental results validate the superiority of our model over the existing methods.
01	To make deep neural networks feasible in resource-constrained environments (such as mobile devices), it is beneficial to quantize models by using low-precision weights. One common technique for quantizing neural networks is the straight-through gradient method, which enables back-propagation through the quantization mapping. Despite its empirical success, little is understood about why the straight-through gradient method works.Building upon a novel observation that the straight-through gradient method is in fact identical to the well-known Nesterov’s dual-averaging algorithm on a quantization constrained optimization problem, we propose a more principled alternative approach, called ProxQuant , that formulates quantized network training as a regularized learning problem instead and optimizes it via the prox-gradient method. ProxQuant does back-propagation on the underlying full-precision vector and applies an efficient prox-operator in between stochastic gradient steps to encourage quantizedness. For quantizing ResNets and LSTMs, ProxQuant outperforms state-of-the-art results on binary quantization and is on par with state-of-the-art on multi-bit quantization. We further perform theoretical analyses showing that ProxQuant converges to stationary points under mild smoothness assumptions, whereas variants such as lazy prox-gradient method can fail to converge in the same setting.
10	Batch normalization (BN) is often used in an attempt to stabilize and accelerate training in deep neural networks. In many cases it indeed decreases the number of parameter updates required to achieve low training error. However, it also reduces robustness to small adversarial input perturbations and common corruptions by double-digit percentages, as we show on five standard datasets. Furthermore, we find that substituting weight decay for BN is sufficient to nullify a relationship between adversarial vulnerability and the input dimension. A recent mean-field analysis found that BN induces gradient explosion when used on multiple layers, but this cannot fully explain the vulnerability we observe, given that it occurs already for a single BN layer. We argue that the actual cause is the tilting of the decision boundary with respect to the nearest-centroid classifier along input dimensions of low variance. As a result, the constant introduced for numerical stability in the BN step acts as an important hyperparameter that can be tuned to recover some robustness at the cost of standard test accuracy. We explain this mechanism explicitly on a linear ``toy model and show in experiments that it still holds for nonlinear ``real-world models.
10	Loss functions play a pivotal role in deep metric learning (DML). A large variety of loss functions have been proposed in DML recently. However, it remains difficult to answer this question: what are the intrinsic differences among these loss functions?This paper answers this question by proposing a unified perspective to rethink deep metric loss functions. We show theoretically that most DML methods in deep metric learning, in view of  gradient equivalence, are essentially weight assignment strategies of training pairs. Based on this unified view, we revisit several typical DML methods and disclose their hidden drawbacks. Moreover, we point out the key components of an effective DML approach which drives us to propose our weight assignment framework. We evaluate our method on image retrieval tasks, and show that it outperforms  the state-of-the-art DML approaches by a significant margin on the CUB-200-2011, Cars-196, Stanford Online Products and In-Shop Clothes Retrieval datasets. 
10	Design of reliable systems must guarantee stability against input perturbations. In machine learning, such guarantee entails preventing overfitting and ensuring robustness of models against corruption of input data. In order to maximize stability, we analyze and develop a computationally efficient implementation of Jacobian regularization that increases classification margins of neural networks. The stabilizing effect of the Jacobian regularizer leads to significant improvements in robustness, as measured against both random and adversarial input perturbations, without severely degrading generalization properties on clean data.
10	 Standard compression algorithms work by mapping an image to discrete code using an encoder from which the original image can be reconstructed through a decoder. This process, due to the quantization step, is inherently non-differentiable so these algorithms must rely on approximate methods to train the encoder and decoder end-to-end. In this paper, we present an innovative framework for lossy image compression which is able to circumvent the quantization step by relying on a non-deterministic compression codec. The decoder maps the input image to a distribution in continuous space from which a sample can be encoded with expected code length being the relative entropy to the encoding distribution, i.e. it is bits-back efficient. The result is a principled, end-to-end differentiable compression framework that can be straight-forwardly trained using standard gradient-based optimizers. To showcase the efficiency of our method, we apply it to lossy image compression by training Probabilistic Ladder Networks (PLNs) on the CLIC 2018 dataset and show that their rate-distortion curves on the Kodak dataset are competitive with the state-of-the-art on low bitrates.
01	Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have made significant strides in performance on applications such as Go and Atari games. However, developing practical methods to balance exploration and exploitation in complex domains remains largely unsolved. Thompson Sampling and its extension to reinforcement learning provide an elegant approach to exploration that only requires access to posterior samples of the model. At the same time, advances in approximate Bayesian methods have made posterior approximation for flexible neural network models practical. Thus, it is attractive to consider approximate Bayesian neural networks in a Thompson Sampling framework. To understand the impact of using an approximate posterior on Thompson Sampling, we benchmark well-established and recently developed methods for approximate posterior sampling combined with Thompson Sampling over a series of contextual bandit problems. We found that many approaches that have been successful in the supervised learning setting underperformed in the sequential decision-making scenario. In particular, we highlight the challenge of adapting slowly converging uncertainty estimates to the online setting.
01	This paper addresses the scalability challenge of architecture search by formulating the task in a differentiable manner. Unlike conventional approaches of applying evolution or reinforcement learning over a discrete and non-differentiable search space, our method is based on the continuous relaxation of the architecture representation, allowing efficient search of the architecture using gradient descent. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 show that our algorithm excels in discovering high-performance convolutional architectures for image classification and recurrent architectures for language modeling, while being orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art non-differentiable techniques.
01	One of the long-standing challenges in Artificial Intelligence for learning goal-directed behavior is to build a single agent which can solve multiple tasks. Recent progress in multi-task learning for goal-directed sequential problems has been in the form of distillation based learning wherein a student network learns from multiple task-specific expert networks by mimicking the task-specific policies of the expert networks. While such approaches offer a promising solution to the multi-task learning problem, they require supervision from large expert networks which require extensive data and computation time for training.In this work, we propose an efficient multi-task learning framework which solves multiple goal-directed tasks in an on-line setup without the need for expert supervision. Our work uses active learning principles to achieve multi-task learning by sampling the harder tasks more than the easier ones. We propose three distinct models under our active sampling framework. An adaptive method with extremely competitive multi-tasking performance. A UCB-based meta-learner which casts the problem of picking the next task to train on as a multi-armed bandit problem. A meta-learning method that casts the next-task picking problem as a full Reinforcement Learning problem and uses actor-critic methods for optimizing the multi-tasking performance directly. We demonstrate results in the Atari 2600 domain on seven multi-tasking instances: three 6-task instances, one 8-task instance, two 12-task instances and one 21-task instance.
10	Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units have the ability to memorise and use long-term dependencies between inputs to generate predictions on time series data. We introduce the concept of modifying the cell state (memory) of LSTMs using rotation matrices parametrised by a new set of trainable weights. This addition shows significant increases of performance on some of the tasks from the bAbI dataset.
10	We present a neural framework for learning associations between interrelated groups of words such as the ones found in Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structures. Our model induces a joint function-specific word vector space, where vectors of e.g. plausible SVO compositions lie close together. The model retains information about word group membership even in the joint space, and can thereby effectively be applied to a number of tasks reasoning over the SVO structure. We show the robustness and versatility of the proposed framework by reporting state-of-the-art results on the tasks of estimating selectional preference (i.e., thematic fit) and event similarity. The results indicate that the combinations of representations learned with our task-independent model outperform task-specific architectures from prior work, while reducing the number of parameters by up to 95%. The proposed framework is versatile and holds promise to support learning function-specific representations beyond the SVO structures.
10	Many works have been proposed in the literature to capture the dynamics of diffusion in networks. While some of them define graphical markovian models to extract temporal relationships between node infections in networks, others consider diffusion episodes as sequences of infections via recurrent neural models. In this paper we propose a model at the crossroads of these two extremes, which embeds the history of diffusion in infected nodes as hidden continuous states. Depending on the trajectory followed by the content before reaching a given node, the distribution of influence probabilities may vary. However, content trajectories  are usually hidden in the data, which induces challenging learning problems. We propose a topological recurrent neural model which exhibits good experimental performances for diffusion modelling and prediction. 
10	Recent work by Jacot et al. (2018) has showed that training a neural network of any kind with gradient descent in parameter space is equivalent to kernel gradient descent in function space with respect to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). Lee et al. (2019) built on this result to show that the output of a neural network trained using full batch gradient descent can be approximated by a linear model for wide networks. In parallel, a recent line of studies ( Schoenhols et al. (2017), Hayou et al. (2019)) suggested that a special initialization known as the Edge of Chaos leads to good performance. In this paper, we bridge the gap between this two concepts and show the impact of the initialization and the activation function on the NTK as the network depth becomes large. We provide experiments illustrating our theoretical results.
10	"While neural networks can be trained to map from one specific dataset to another, they usually do not learn a generalized transformation that can extrapolate accurately outside the space of training. For instance, a generative adversarial network (GAN) exclusively trained to transform images of cars from light to dark might not have the same effect on images of horses. This is because neural networks are good at generation within the manifold of the data that they are trained on. However, generating new samples outside of the manifold or extrapolating ""out-of-sample"" is a much harder problem that has been less well studied. To address this, we introduce a technique called neuron editing that learns how neurons encode an edit for a particular transformation in a latent space. We use an autoencoder to decompose the variation within the dataset into activations of different neurons and generate transformed data by defining an editing transformation on those neurons. By performing the transformation in a latent trained space, we encode fairly complex and non-linear transformations to the data with much simpler distribution shifts to the neuron's activations. We showcase our technique on image domain/style transfer and two biological applications: removal of batch artifacts representing unwanted noise and modeling the effect of drug treatments to predict synergy between drugs."
01	Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance in many computer vision tasks. Most state-of-the-art~(SOTA) semantic segmentation and object detection approaches reuse neural network architectures designed for image classification as the backbone, commonly pre-trained on ImageNet. However, performance gains can be achieved by designing network architectures specifically for detection and segmentation, as shown by recent neural architecture search (NAS) research for detection and segmentation. One major challenge though, is that ImageNet pre-training of the search space representation (a.k.a. super network) or the searched networks incurs huge computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fast Neural Network Adaptation (FNA) method, which can adapt both the architecture and parameters of a seed network (e.g. a high performing manually designed backbone) to become a network with different depth, width, or kernels via a Parameter Remapping technique, making it possible to utilize NAS for detection/segmentation tasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we conduct FNA on MobileNetV2 to obtain new networks for both segmentation and detection that clearly out-perform existing networks designed both manually and by NAS. The total computation cost of FNA is significantly less than SOTA segmentation/detection NAS approaches: 1737$\times$ less than DPC, 6.8$\times$ less than Auto-DeepLab and 7.4$\times$ less than DetNAS.

10	System identification of complex and nonlinear systems is a central problem for model predictive control and model-based reinforcement learning. Despite their complexity, such systems can often be approximated well by a set of linear dynamical systems if broken into appropriate subsequences. This mechanism not only helps us find good approximations of dynamics, but also gives us deeper insight into the underlying system. Leveraging Bayesian inference and Variational Autoencoders, we show how to learn a richer and more meaningful state space, e.g. encoding joint constraints and collisions with walls in a maze, from partial and high-dimensional observations. This representation translates into a gain of accuracy of the learned dynamics which we showcase on various simulated tasks.
10	"As the pace of deep learning innovation accelerates, it becomes increasingly important to organize the space of problems by relative difficultly.  Looking to other fields for inspiration, we see analogies to the Chomsky Hierarchy in computational linguistics and time and space complexity in theoretical computer science.As a complement to prior theoretical work on the data and computational requirements of learning, this paper presents an empirical approach. We introduce a methodology for measuring validation error scaling with data and model size and test tasks in natural language, vision, and speech domains. We find that power-law validation error scaling exists across a breadth of factors and that model size scales sublinearly with data size, suggesting that simple learning theoretic models offer insights into the scaling behavior of realistic deep learning settings, and providing a new perspective on how to organize the space of  problems. We measure the power-law exponent---the ""steepness"" of the learning curve---and propose using this metric to sort problems by degree of difficulty.  There is no data like more data, but some tasks are more effective at taking advantage of more data.  Those that are more effective are easier on the proposed scale. Using this approach, we can observe that studied tasks in speech and vision domains scale faster than those in the natural language domain, offering insight into the observation that progress in these areas has proceeded more rapidly than in natural language."
10	Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a promising technique for automatic neural network design. However, existing NAS approaches often utilize manually designed action space, which is not directly related to the performance metric to be optimized (e.g., accuracy). As a result, using manually designed action space to perform NAS often leads to sample-inefficient explorations of architectures and thus can be sub-optimal. In order to improve sample efficiency, this paper proposes Latent Action Neural Architecture Search (LaNAS) that learns actions to recursively partition the search space into good or bad regions that contain networks with concentrated performance metrics, i.e., low variance. During the search phase, as different architecture search action sequences lead to regions of different performance, the search efficiency can be significantly improved by biasing towards the good regions. On the largest NAS dataset NASBench-101, our experimental results demonstrated that LaNAS is 22x, 14.6x, 12.4x, 6.8x, 16.5x more sample-efficient than Random Search, Regularized Evolution, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Neural Architecture Optimization, and Bayesian Optimization, respectively. When applied to the open domain, LaNAS achieves 98.0% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 75.0% top1 accuracy on ImageNet in only 803 samples, outperforming SOTA AmoebaNet with 33x fewer samples.
10	We propose a probabilistic framework for domain adaptation that blends both generative and discriminative modeling in a principled way. Under this framework, generative and discriminative models correspond to specific choices of the prior over parameters. This provides us a very general way to interpolate between generative and discriminative extremes through different choices of priors. By maximizing both the marginal and the conditional log-likelihoods, models derived from this framework can use both labeled instances from the source domain as well as unlabeled instances from \emph{both} source and target domains. Under this framework, we show that the popular reconstruction loss of autoencoder corresponds to an upper bound of the negative marginal log-likelihoods of unlabeled instances, where marginal distributions are given by proper kernel density estimations. This provides a way to interpret the empirical success of autoencoders in domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. We instantiate our framework using neural networks, and build a concrete model,  \emph{DAuto}. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DAuto on text, image and speech datasets, showing that it outperforms related competitors when domain adaptation is possible.
10	We propose negative sampling as an approach to improve the notoriously bad out-of-distribution likelihood estimates of Variational Autoencoder models. Our model pushes latent images of negative samples away from the prior. When the source of negative samples is an auxiliary dataset, such a model can vastly improve on baselines when evaluated on OOD detection tasks. Perhaps more surprisingly, we present a fully unsupervised variant that can also significantly improve detection performance: using the output of the generator as a source of negative samples results in a fully unsupervised model that can be interpreted as adversarially trained.
10	We review the limitations of BLEU and ROUGE -- the most popular metrics used to assess reference summaries against hypothesis summaries, and introduce JAUNE:  a set of criteria for what a good metric should behave like and propose concrete ways to use recent Transformers-based Language Models to assess reference summaries against hypothesis summaries.
01	Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been successfully applied to multiple artificial intelligence areas and shows better performance compared with hand-designed networks. However, the existing NAS methods only target a specific task. Most of them usually do well in searching an architecture for single task but are troublesome for multiple datasets or multiple tasks. Generally, the architecture for a new task is either searched from scratch, which is neither efficient nor flexible enough for practical application scenarios, or borrowed from the ones searched on other tasks, which might be not optimal. In order to tackle the transferability of NAS and conduct fast adaptation of neural architectures, we propose a novel Transferable Neural Architecture Search method based on meta-learning in this paper, which is termed as T-NAS. T-NAS learns a meta-architecture that is able to adapt to a new task quickly through a few gradient steps, which makes the transferred architecture suitable for the specific task. Extensive experiments show that T-NAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot learning and comparable performance in supervised learning but with 50x less searching cost, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.
01	Hypernetworks are meta neural networks that generate weights for a main neural network in an end-to-end differentiable manner. Despite extensive applications ranging from multi-task learning to Bayesian deep learning, the problem of optimizing hypernetworks has not been studied to date. We observe that classical weight initialization methods like Glorot & Bengio (2010) and He et al. (2015), when applied directly on a hypernet, fail to produce weights for the mainnet in the correct scale. We develop principled techniques for weight initialization in hypernets, and show that they lead to more stable mainnet weights, lower training loss, and faster convergence.
10	Models based on the Transformer architecture have achieved better accuracy than models based on competing architectures. A unique feature of the Transformer is its universal application of a self-attention mechanism, which allows for free information flow at arbitrary distances. In this paper, we provide two alternative views of the attention mechanism: one from the probabilistic view via the Gaussian mixture model, the other from the optimization view via optimal transport. Following these insights, we propose a new attention scheme that requires normalization on both the upper and lower layers, called the doubly-normalized attention scheme. We analyze the properties of both the original and the new attention schemes, and find that the doubly-normalized attention mechanism directly mitigates two unwanted effects: it resolves the explaining-away effect and alleviates mode collapse. We conduct empirical studies that quantify numerical advantages for the doubly-normalized attention model, as well as for a hybrid model that dynamically combines both attention schemes to achieve improved performance on several well-known benchmarks.
01	DeConvNet, Guided BackProp, LRP, were invented to better understand deep neural networks. We show that these methods do not produce the theoretically correct explanation for a linear model. Yet they are used on multi-layer networks with millions of parameters. This is a cause for concern since linear models are simple neural networks. We argue that explanation methods for neural nets should work reliably in the limit of  simplicity, the linear models. Based on our analysis of linear models we propose a generalization that yields two explanation techniques (PatternNet and PatternAttribution) that are theoretically sound for linear models and produce improved explanations for deep networks.
10	We consider statistical learning problems, when the distribution $P'$ of the training observations $Z'_1,\; \ldots,\; Z'_n$ differs from the distribution $P$ involved in the risk one seeks to minimize (referred to as the \textit{test distribution}) but is still defined on the same measurable space as $P$ and dominates it. In the unrealistic case where the likelihood ratio $\Phi(z)=dP/dP'(z)$ is known, one may straightforwardly extends the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) approach to this specific \textit{transfer learning} setup using the same idea as that behind Importance Sampling, by minimizing a weighted version of the empirical risk functional computed from the 'biased' training data $Z'_i$ with weights $\Phi(Z'_i)$. Although the \textit{importance function} $\Phi(z)$ is generally unknown in practice, we show that, in various situations frequently encountered in practice, it takes a simple form and can be directly estimated from the $Z'_i$'s and some auxiliary information on the statistical population $P$. By means of linearization techniques, we then prove that the generalization capacity of the approach aforementioned is preserved when plugging the resulting estimates of the $\Phi(Z'_i)$'s into the  weighted empirical risk. Beyond these theoretical guarantees, numerical results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of the approach promoted in this article.
01	We present a provable, sampling-based approach for generating compact Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by identifying and removing redundant filters from an over-parameterized network. Our algorithm uses a small batch of input data points to assign a saliency score to each filter and constructs an importance sampling distribution where filters that highly affect the output are sampled with correspondingly high probability. In contrast to existing filter pruning approaches, our method is simultaneously data-informed, exhibits provable guarantees on the size and performance of the pruned network, and is widely applicable to varying network architectures and data sets. Our analytical bounds bridge the notions of compressibility and importance of network structures, which gives rise to a fully-automated procedure for identifying and preserving filters in layers that are essential to the network's performance. Our experimental evaluations on popular architectures and data sets show that our algorithm consistently generates sparser and more efficient models than those constructed by existing filter pruning approaches. 
01	Batch Normalization (BN) is a common technique used to speed-up and stabilize training. On the other hand, the learnable parameters of BN are commonly used in conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) for representing class-specific information using conditional Batch Normalization (cBN). In this paper we propose to generalize both BN and cBN using a Whitening and Coloring based batch normalization. We show that our conditional Coloring can represent categorical conditioning information which largely helps the cGAN qualitative results. Moreover, we show that full-feature whitening is important in a general GAN scenario in which the training process is known to be highly unstable. We test our approach on different datasets and using different GAN networks and training protocols, showing a consistent improvement in all the tested frameworks. Our CIFAR-10 conditioned results are higher than all previous works on this dataset.
01	Whilst deep neural networks have shown great empirical success, there is still much work to be done to understand their theoretical properties. In this paper, we study the relationship between Gaussian processes with a recursive kernel definition and random wide fully connected feedforward networks with more than one hidden layer. We exhibit limiting procedures under which finite deep networks will converge in distribution to the corresponding Gaussian process. To evaluate convergence rates empirically, we use maximum mean discrepancy. We then exhibit situations where existing Bayesian deep networks are close to Gaussian processes in terms of the key quantities of interest. Any Gaussian process has a flat representation. Since this behaviour may be undesirable in certain situations we discuss ways in which it might be prevented.
10	This work introduces a simple network for producing character aware word embeddings. Position agnostic and position aware character embeddings are combined to produce an embedding vector for each word. The learned word representations are shown to be very sparse and facilitate improved results on language modeling tasks, despite using markedly fewer parameters, and without the need to apply dropout. A final experiment suggests that weight sharing contributes to sparsity, increases performance, and prevents overfitting.
10	With interest in program synthesis and similarly ﬂavored problems rapidly increasing, neural models optimized for tree-domain problems are of great value. In the sequence domain, transformers can learn relationships across arbitrary pairs of positions with less bias than recurrent models. Under the intuition that a similar property would be beneficial in the tree domain, we propose a method to extend transformers to tree-structured inputs and/or outputs. Our approach abstracts transformer's default sinusoidal positional encodings, allowing us to substitute in a novel custom positional encoding scheme that represents node positions within a tree. We evaluated our model in tree-to-tree program translation and sequence-to-tree semantic parsing settings, achieving superior performance over the vanilla transformer model on several tasks.
10	Various gradient compression schemes have been proposed to mitigate the communication cost in distributed training of large scale machine learning models. Sign-based methods, such as signSGD (Bernstein et al., 2018), have recently been gaining popularity because of their simple compression rule and connection to adaptive gradient methods, like ADAM. In this paper, we perform a general analysis of sign-based methods for non-convex optimization. Our analysis is built on intuitive bounds on success probabilities and does not rely on special noise distributions nor on the boundedness of the variance of stochastic gradients. Extending the theory to distributed setting within a parameter server framework, we assure exponentially fast variance reduction with respect to number of nodes, maintaining 1-bit compression in both directions and using small mini-batch sizes. We validate our theoretical findings experimentally.
01	We present a method which learns to integrate temporal information, from a learned dynamics model, with ambiguous visual information, from a learned vision model, in the context of interacting agents. Our method is based on a graph-structured variational recurrent neural network, which is trained end-to-end to infer the current state of the (partially observed) world, as well as to forecast future states. We show that our method outperforms various baselines on two sports datasets, one based on real basketball trajectories, and one generated by a soccer game engine.
01	We introduce ES-MAML, a new framework for solving the model agnostic meta learning (MAML) problem based on Evolution Strategies (ES). Existing algorithms for MAML are based on policy gradients, and incur significant difficulties when attempting to estimate second derivatives using backpropagation on stochastic policies. We show how ES can be applied to MAML to obtain an algorithm which avoids the problem of estimating second derivatives, and is also conceptually simple and easy to implement. Moreover, ES-MAML can handle new types of nonsmooth adaptation operators, and other techniques for improving performance and estimation of ES methods become applicable. We show empirically that ES-MAML is competitive with existing methods and often yields better adaptation with fewer queries.
01	Visual Interpretation and explanation of deep models is critical towards wide adoption of systems that rely on them. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for both interpretation as well as explanation in which, given a pretrained model, we automatically identify internal features relevant for the set of classes considered by the model, without relying on additional annotations. We interpret the model through average visualizations of this reduced set of features. Then, at test time, we explain the network prediction by accompanying the predicted class label with supporting visualizations derived from the identified features. In addition, we propose a method to address the artifacts introduced by strided operations in deconvNet-based visualizations. Moreover, we introduce an8Flower , a dataset specifically designed for objective quantitative evaluation of methods for visual explanation. Experiments on the MNIST , ILSVRC 12, Fashion 144k and an8Flower datasets show that our method produces detailed explanations with good coverage of relevant features of the classes of interest.
10	Recent work has demonstrated the lack of robustness of well-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples.  For example, visually indistinguishable perturbations, when mixed with an original image, can easily lead deep learning models to misclassifications.  In light of a recent study on the mutual influence between robustness and accuracy over 18 different ImageNet models, this paper investigates how training data affect the accuracy and robustness of deep neuralnetworks. We conduct extensive experiments on four different datasets, including CIFAR-10, MNIST, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet, with several representative neural networks. Our results reveal previously unknown phenomena that exist between the size of training data and characteristics of the resulting models. In particular, besides confirming that the model accuracy improves as the amount of training data increases, we also observe that the model robustness improves initially, but there exists a turning point after which robustness starts to decrease.  How and when such turning points occur vary for different neural networks and different datasets.
10	Deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) andVariational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are important tools to capture and investigatethe properties of complex empirical data. However, the complexity of their innerelements makes their functionment challenging to assess and modify. In thisrespect, these architectures behave as black box models. In order to betterunderstand the function of such networks, we analyze their modularity based onthe counterfactual manipulation of their internal variables. Our experiments on thegeneration of human faces with VAEs and GANs support that modularity betweenactivation maps distributed over channels of generator architectures is achievedto some degree, can be used to better understand how these systems operate and allow meaningful transformations of the generated images without further training.erate and edit the content of generated images.
10	We consider the problem of training generative models with deep neural networks as generators, i.e. to map latent codes to data points. Whereas the dominant paradigm combines simple priors over codes with complex deterministic models,we argue that it might be advantageous to use more flexible code distributions. We demonstrate how these distributions can be induced directly from the data. The benefits include: more powerful generative models, better modeling of latentstructure and explicit control of the degree of generalization.
10	Quantifying, enforcing and implementing fairness emerged as a major topic in machine learning. We investigate these questions in the context of deep learning. Our main algorithmic and theoretical tool is the computational estimation of similarities between probability, ``\`a la Wasserstein'', using adversarial networks. This idea is flexible enough to investigate different fairness constrained learning tasks, which we model by specifying properties of the underlying data generative process. The first setting considers bias in the generative model which should be filtered out. The second model is related to the presence of nuisance variables in the observations producing an unwanted bias for the learning task.  For both models, we devise a learning algorithm based on approximation of Wasserstein distances using adversarial networks. We provide formal arguments describing the fairness enforcing properties of these algorithm in relation with the underlying fairness generative processes. Finally we perform experiments, both on synthetic and real world data, to demonstrate empirically the superiority of our approach compared to state of the art fairness algorithms as well as concurrent GAN type adversarial architectures based on Jensen divergence.
10	Spatio-Temporal processes bear a central importance in many applied scientific fields. Generally, differential equations are used to describe these processes. In this work, we address the problem of learning spatio-temporal dynamics with neural networks when only partial information on the system's state is available. Taking inspiration from the dynamical system approach, we outline a general framework in which complex dynamics generated by families of differential equations  can be learned in a principled way. Two models are derived from this framework. We demonstrate how they can be applied in practice by considering the problem of forecasting fluid flows. We show how the underlying equations fit into our formalism and evaluate our method by comparing with standard baselines.
01	We present a novel black-box adversarial attack algorithm with state-of-the-art model evasion rates for query efficiency under $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ metrics. It exploits a \textit{sign-based}, rather than magnitude-based, gradient estimation approach that shifts the gradient estimation from continuous to binary black-box optimization. It adaptively constructs queries to estimate the gradient, one query relying upon the previous, rather than re-estimating the gradient each step with random query construction. Its reliance on sign bits yields  a smaller memory footprint and it requires neither hyperparameter tuning or dimensionality reduction. Further, its theoretical performance is guaranteed and it can characterize  adversarial subspaces better than white-box gradient-aligned subspaces. On two public black-box attack challenges and a model robustly trained against transfer attacks, the algorithm's evasion rates surpass all submitted attacks. For a suite of published models,  the algorithm is $3.8\times$ less failure-prone while spending $2.5\times$  fewer queries versus the best combination of state of art algorithms. For example, it evades a standard MNIST model using just $12$ queries on average. Similar performance is observed on a standard IMAGENET model with an average of $579$ queries.
01	"We study adversarial robustness of neural networks from a margin maximization perspective, where margins are defined as the distances from inputs to a classifier's decision boundary.Our study shows that maximizing margins can be achieved by minimizing the adversarial loss on the decision boundary at the ""shortest successful perturbation"", demonstrating a close connection between adversarial losses and the margins. We propose Max-Margin Adversarial (MMA) training to directly maximize the margins to achieve adversarial robustness. Instead of adversarial training with a fixed $\epsilon$, MMA offers an improvement by enabling adaptive selection of the ""correct"" $\epsilon$ as the margin individually for each datapoint. In addition, we rigorously analyze adversarial training with the perspective of margin maximization, and provide an alternative interpretation for adversarial training, maximizing either a lower or an upper bound of the margins. Our experiments empirically confirm our theory and demonstrate MMA training's efficacy on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets w.r.t. $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ robustness."
01	Common-sense physical reasoning is an essential ingredient for any intelligent agent operating in the real-world. For example, it can be used to simulate the environment, or to infer the state of parts of the world that are currently unobserved. In order to match real-world conditions this causal knowledge must be learned without access to supervised data. To address this problem we present a novel method that learns to discover objects and model their physical interactions from raw visual images in a purely unsupervised fashion. It incorporates prior knowledge about the compositional nature of human perception to factor interactions between object-pairs and learn efficiently. On videos of bouncing balls we show the superior modelling capabilities of our method compared to other unsupervised neural approaches that do not incorporate such prior knowledge. We demonstrate its ability to handle occlusion and show that it can extrapolate learned knowledge to scenes with different numbers of objects.
10	In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework, namely DelibGAN, for generating high-quality sentences without supervision. Our framework consists of a coarse-to-fine generator, which contains a first-pass decoder and a second-pass decoder, and a multiple instance discriminator. And we propose two training mechanisms DelibGAN-I and DelibGAN-II. The discriminator is used to fine-tune the second-pass decoder in DelibGAN-I and further evaluate the importance of each word and tune the first-pass decoder in DelibGAN-II. We compare our models with several typical and state-of-the-art unsupervised generic text generation models on three datasets (a synthetic dataset, a descriptive text dataset and a sentimental text dataset). Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that our models produce more realistic samples, and DelibGAN-II performs best.
10	We introduce CuLE (CUDA Learning Environment), a CUDA port of the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) which is used for the development of deep reinforcement algorithms.  CuLE overcomes many limitations of existing CPU-based emulators and scales naturally to multiple GPUs. It leverages GPU parallelization to run thousands of games simultaneously and it renders frames directly on the GPU, to avoid the bottleneck arising from the limited CPU-GPU communication bandwidth. CuLE generates up to 155M frames per hour on a single GPU, a finding previously achieved only through a cluster of CPUs. Beyond highlighting the differences between CPU and GPU emulators in the context of reinforcement learning, we show how to leverage the high throughput of CuLE by effective batching of the training data, and show accelerated convergence for A2C+V-trace. CuLE is available at [hidden URL].
01	The recently presented idea to learn heuristics for combinatorial optimization problems is promising as it can save costly development. However, to push this idea towards practical implementation, we need better models and better ways of training. We contribute in both directions: we propose a model based on attention layers with benefits over the Pointer Network and we show how to train this model using REINFORCE with a simple baseline based on a deterministic greedy rollout, which we find is more efficient than using a value function. We significantly improve over recent learned heuristics for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), getting close to optimal results for problems up to 100 nodes. With the same hyperparameters, we learn strong heuristics for two variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the Orienteering Problem (OP) and (a stochastic variant of) the Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP), outperforming a wide range of baselines and getting results close to highly optimized and specialized algorithms.
10	Energy-based models (EBMs), a.k.a. un-normalized models, have had recent successes in continuous spaces. However, they have not been successfully applied to model text sequences.  While decreasing the energy at training samples is straightforward, mining (negative) samples where the energy should be increased is difficult.   In part, this is because standard gradient-based methods are not readily applicable when the input is high-dimensional and discrete.  Here, we side-step this issue by generating negatives using pre-trained auto-regressive language models.  The EBM then worksin the {\em residual} of the language model; and is trained to discriminate real text from text generated by the auto-regressive models.We  investigate the generalization ability of residual EBMs, a pre-requisite for using them in other applications.  We extensively analyze generalization for the task of classifying whether an input is machine or human generated, a natural task given the training loss and how we mine negatives. Overall, we observe that EBMs can generalize remarkably well to changes in the architecture of the generators producing negatives. However, EBMs exhibit more sensitivity to the training set used by such generators.
10	Deep learning (DL) is having a revolutionary impact in image processing, with DL-based approaches now holding the state of the art in many tasks, including image compression. However, video compression has so far resisted the DL revolution, with the very few proposed approaches being based on complex and impractical architectures with multiple networks. This paper proposes what we believe is the first approach to end-to-end learning of a single network for video compression. We tackle the problem in a novel way, avoiding explicit motion estimation/prediction, by formalizing it as the rate-distortion optimization of a single spatio-temporal autoencoder; i.e., we jointly learn a latent-space projection transform and a synthesis transform for low bitrate video compression. The quantizer uses a rounding scheme, which is relaxed during training, and an entropy estimation technique to enforce an information bottleneck, inspired by recent advances in image compression. We compare the obtained video compression networks with standard widely-used codecs, showing better performance than the MPEG-4 standard, being competitive with H.264/AVC for low bitrates. 
10	Active learning typically focuses on training a model on few labeled examples alone, while unlabeled ones are only used for acquisition. In this work we depart from this setting by using both labeled and unlabeled data during model training across active learning cycles. We do so by using unsupervised feature learning at the beginning of the active learning pipeline and semi-supervised learning at every active learning cycle, on all available data. The former has not been investigated before in active learning, while the study of latter in the context of deep learning is scarce and recent findings are not conclusive with respect to its benefit. Our idea is orthogonal to acquisition strategies by using more data, much like ensemble methods use more models. By systematically evaluating on a number of popular acquisition strategies and datasets, we find that the use of unlabeled data during model training brings a spectacular accuracy improvement in image classification, compared to the differences between acquisition strategies. We thus explore smaller label budgets, even one label per class. 
10	Learning group representation is a commonly concerned issue in tasks where the basic unit is a group, set or sequence.The computer vision community tries to tackle it by aggregating the elements in a group based on an indicator either defined by human such as the quality or saliency of an element, or generated by a black box such as the attention score or output of a RNN. This article provides a more essential and explicable view. We claim the most significant indicator to show whether the group representation can be benefited from an element is not the quality, or an inexplicable score, but the \textit{discrimiability}. Our key insight is to explicitly design the \textit{discrimiability} using embedded class centroids on a proxy set, and show the discrimiability distribution \textit{w.r.t.} the element space can be distilled by a light-weight auxiliary distillation network. This processing is called \textit{discriminability distillation learning} (DDL).We show the proposed DDL can be flexibly plugged into many group based recognition tasks without influencing the training procedure of the original tasks. Comprehensive experiments on set-to-set face recognition and action recognition valid the advantage of DDL on both accuracy and efficiency, and it pushes forward the state-of-the-art results on these tasks by an impressive margin.
