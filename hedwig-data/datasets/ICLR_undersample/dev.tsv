10	Neural embeddings have been used with great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where they provide compact representations that encapsulate word similarity and attain state-of-the-art performance in a range of linguistic tasks. The success of neural embeddings has prompted significant amounts of research into applications in domains other than language. One such domain is graph-structured data, where embeddings of vertices can be learned that encapsulate vertex similarity and improve performance on tasks including edge prediction and vertex labelling. For both NLP and graph-based tasks, embeddings in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces have been learned.However, recent work has shown that the appropriate isometric space for embedding complex networks is not the flat Euclidean space, but a negatively curved hyperbolic space. We present a new concept that exploits these recent insights and propose learning neural embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space. We provide experimental evidence that hyperbolic embeddings significantly outperform Euclidean embeddings on vertex classification tasks for several real-world public datasets. 
10	Two main families of reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-learning and policy gradients, have recently been proven to be equivalent when using a softmax relaxation on one part, and an entropic regularization on the other. We relate this result to the well-known convex duality of Shannon entropy and the softmax function. Such a result is also known as the Donsker-Varadhan formula. This provides a short proof of the equivalence. We then interpret this duality further, and use ideas of convex analysis to prove a new policy inequality relative to soft Q-learning.
10	In this paper, we aim to develop a novel mechanism to preserve differential privacy (DP) in adversarial learning for deep neural networks, with provable robustness to adversarial examples. We leverage the sequential composition theory in DP, to establish a new connection between DP preservation and provable robustness. To address the trade-off among model utility, privacy loss, and robustness, we design an original, differentially private, adversarial objective function, based on the post-processing property in DP, to tighten the sensitivity of our model. An end-to-end theoretical analysis and thorough evaluations show that our mechanism notably improves the robustness of DP deep neural networks.
10	Meta-learning has recently achieved success in many optimization problems. In general, a meta learner g(.) could be learned for a base model f(.) on a variety of tasks, such that it can be more efficient on a new task. In this paper, we make some key modifications to enhance the performance of meta-learning models. (1) we leverage different meta-strategies for different modules to optimize them separately: we use conservative “slow learners” on low-level basic feature representation layers and “fast learners” on high-level task-specific layers; (2) Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis on why the proposed approach works, based on a case study on a two-layer MLP. We evaluate our model on synthetic MLP regression, as well as low-shot learning tasks on Omniglot and ImageNet benchmarks. We demonstrate that our approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
10	We propose a framework to understand the unprecedented performance and robustness of deep neural networks using field theory. Correlations between the weights within the same layer can be described by symmetries in that layer, and networks generalize better if such symmetries are broken to reduce the redundancies of the weights. Using a two parameter field theory, we find that the network can break such symmetries itself towards the end of training in a process commonly known in physics as spontaneous symmetry breaking. This corresponds to a network generalizing itself without any user input layers to break the symmetry, but by communication with adjacent layers. In the layer decoupling limit applicable to residual networks (He et al., 2015), we show that the remnant symmetries that survive the non-linear layers are spontaneously broken based on empirical results. The Lagrangian for the non-linear and weight layers together has striking similarities with the one in quantum field theory of a scalar. Using results from quantum field theory we show that our framework is able to explain many experimentally observed phenomena, such as training on random labels with zero error (Zhang et al., 2017), the information bottleneck and the phase transition out of it (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017), shattered gradients (Balduzzi et al., 2017), and many more.
10	We introduce the deep abstaining classifier -- a deep neural network trained with a novel loss function that provides an abstention option during training. This allows the  DNN to abstain on confusing or difficult-to-learn examples while improving performance on the non-abstained samples. We show that such deep abstaining classifiers can: (i) learn representations for structured noise -- where noisy training labels or confusing examples are correlated with underlying features -- and then learn to abstain based on such features; (ii) enable robust learning in the presence of arbitrary or unstructured noise by identifying noisy samples; and (iii) be used as an effective out-of-category detector that learns to reliably abstain when presented with samples from  unknown classes. We provide analytical results on loss function behavior that enable automatic tuning of accuracy and coverage, and demonstrate the utility of the deep abstaining classifier using multiple image benchmarks, Results indicate significant improvement in learning in the presence of label noise.
01	Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have made significant strides in performance on applications such as Go and Atari games. However, developing practical methods to balance exploration and exploitation in complex domains remains largely unsolved. Thompson Sampling and its extension to reinforcement learning provide an elegant approach to exploration that only requires access to posterior samples of the model. At the same time, advances in approximate Bayesian methods have made posterior approximation for flexible neural network models practical. Thus, it is attractive to consider approximate Bayesian neural networks in a Thompson Sampling framework. To understand the impact of using an approximate posterior on Thompson Sampling, we benchmark well-established and recently developed methods for approximate posterior sampling combined with Thompson Sampling over a series of contextual bandit problems. We found that many approaches that have been successful in the supervised learning setting underperformed in the sequential decision-making scenario. In particular, we highlight the challenge of adapting slowly converging uncertainty estimates to the online setting.
10	In this work, we propose a generally applicable transformation unit for visual recognition with deep convolutional neural networks. This transformation explicitly models channel relationships with explainable control variables. These variables determine the neuron behaviors of competition or cooperation, and they are jointly optimized with convolutional weights towards more accurate recognition. In Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Networks, the channel relationships are implicitly learned by fully connected layers, and the SE block is integrated at the block-level. We instead introduce a channel normalization layer to reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity. This lightweight layer incorporates a simple L2 normalization, enabling our transformation unit applicable to operator-level without much increase of additional parameters.  Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our unit with clear margins on many vision tasks, i.e., image classification on ImageNet, object detection, and instance segmentation on COCO, video classification on Kinetics.
10	Building on the success of deep learning, two modern approaches to learn a probability model of the observed data are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs). VAEs consider an explicit probability model for the data and compute a generative distribution by maximizing a variational lower-bound on the log-likelihood function. GANs, however, compute a generative model by minimizing a distance between observed and generated probability distributions without considering an explicit model for the observed data. The lack of having explicit probability models in GANs prohibits computation of sample likelihoods in their frameworks and limits their use in statistical inference problems. In this work, we show that an optimal transport GAN with the entropy regularization can be viewed as a generative model that maximizes a lower-bound on average sample likelihoods, an approach that VAEs are based on. In particular, our proof constructs an explicit probability model for GANs that can be used to compute likelihood statistics within GAN's framework. Our numerical results on several datasets demonstrate consistent trends with the proposed theory. 
10	We consider the fundamental problem of semi-supervised node classification in attributed graphs with a focus on \emph{few-shot} learning. Here, we propose Structural Regularized Graph Convolutional Networks (SRGCN), novel neural network architectures extending the well-known GCN structures by stacking transposed convolutional layers for reconstruction of input features. We add a reconstruction error term in the loss function as a regularizer. Unlike standard regularization such as $L_1$ or $L_2$, which controls the model complexity by including a penalty term depends solely on parameters, our regularization function is parameterized by a trainable neural network whose structure depends on the topology of the underlying graph. The new approach effectively addresses the shortcomings of previous graph convolution-based techniques for learning classifiers in the few-shot regime and significantly improves generalization performance over original GCNs when the number of labeled samples is insufficient. Experimental studies on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach has matched state-of-the-art results and can improve classification accuracies by a notable margin when there are very few examples from each class.
01	Almost all current adversarial attacks of CNN classifiers rely on information derived from the output layer of the network. This work presents a new adversarial attack based on the modeling and exploitation of class-wise and layer-wise deep feature distributions. We achieve state-of-the-art targeted blackbox transfer-based attack results for undefended ImageNet models. Further, we place a priority on explainability and interpretability of the attacking process. Our methodology affords an analysis of how adversarial attacks change the intermediate feature distributions of CNNs, as well as a measure of layer-wise and class-wise feature distributional separability/entanglement. We also conceptualize a transition from task/data-specific to model-specific features within a CNN architecture that directly impacts the transferability of adversarial examples. 
10	The inference of Gaussian Processes concerns the distribution of the underlying function given observed data points. GP inference based on local ranges of data points is able to capture fine-scale correlations and allow fine-grained decomposition of the computation. Following this direction, we propose a new inference model that considers the correlations and observations of the K nearest neighbors for the inference at a data point. Compared with previous works, we also eliminate the data ordering prerequisite to simplify the inference process. Additionally, the inference task is decomposed to small subtasks with several technique innovations, making our model well suits the stochastic optimization. Since the decomposed small subtasks have the same structure, we further speed up the inference procedure with amortized inference. Our model runs efficiently and achieves good performances on several benchmark tasks.
10	We propose a novel end-to-end trainable framework for the graph decomposition problem. The minimum cost multicut problem is first converted to an unconstrained binary cubic formulation where cycle consistency constraints are incorporated into the objective function. The new optimization problem can be viewed as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) in which the random variables are associated with the binary edge labels of the initial graph and the hard constraints are introduced in the CRF as high-order potentials. The parameters of a standard Neural Network and the fully differentiable CRF can be optimized in an end-to-end manner.  We demonstrate the proposed learning algorithm in the context of clustering of hand written digits, particularly in a setting where no direct supervision for the graph decomposition task is available, and multiple person pose estimation from images in the wild. The experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach both for the feature learning and for the final clustering task.
01	Domain adaptation for visual recognition has undergone great progress in the past few years. Nevertheless, most existing methods work in the so-called closed-set scenario, assuming that the classes depicted by the target images are exactly the same as those of the source domain. In this paper, we tackle the more challenging, yet more realistic case of open-set domain adaptation, where new, unknown classes can be present in the target data. While, in the unsupervised scenario, one cannot expect to be able to identify each specific new class, we aim to automatically detect which samples belong to these new classes and discard them from the recognition process. To this end, we rely on the intuition that the source and target samples depicting the known classes can be generated by a shared subspace, whereas the target samples from unknown classes come from a different, private subspace. We therefore introduce a framework that factorizes the data into shared and private parts, while encouraging the shared representation to be discriminative. Our experiments on standard benchmarks evidence that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in open-set domain adaptation.
01	Deep neural networks (DNNs) generalize remarkably well without explicit regularization even in the strongly over-parametrized regime  where classical learning theory would instead predict that they would severely overfit.  While many proposals for some kind of implicit regularization have been made to rationalise this success, there is no consensus for the fundamental reason why DNNs do not strongly overfit.  In this paper, we provide a new explanation. By applying a very general probability-complexity bound recently derived from  algorithmic information theory (AIT), we argue that the parameter-function map of many DNNs should be exponentially biased towards simple functions. We then provide clear evidence for this strong simplicity bias in a model DNN for Boolean functions, as well as in much larger fully connected and convolutional networks trained on CIFAR10 and MNIST.As the target functions in many real problems are expected to be highly structured, this intrinsic simplicity bias helps explain why deep networks generalize well on real world problems.This picture also facilitates a novel PAC-Bayes approach where the prior is taken over the DNN input-output function space, rather than  the more conventional prior over parameter space.  If we assume that the training algorithm samples parameters close to uniformly within the zero-error region then the PAC-Bayes theorem can be used to guarantee good expected generalization for target functions producing high-likelihood training sets.  By exploiting recently discovered connections between DNNs and Gaussian processes to estimate the marginal likelihood,  we produce relatively tight generalization PAC-Bayes error bounds which correlate well with the true error on realistic datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10 and for architectures including convolutional and fully connected networks.
10	Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on long sequence tasks is plagued with difficulties arising from the exponential explosion or vanishing of signals as they propagate forward or backward through the network. Many techniques have been proposed to ameliorate these issues, including various algorithmic and architectural modifications. Two of the most successful RNN architectures, the LSTM and the GRU, do exhibit modest improvements over vanilla RNN cells, but they still suffer from instabilities when trained on very long sequences. In this work, we develop a mean field theory of signal propagation in LSTMs and GRUs that enables us to calculate the time scales for signal propagation as well as the spectral properties of the state-to-state Jacobians. By optimizing these quantities in terms of the initialization hyperparameters, we derive a novel initialization scheme that eliminates or reduces training instabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our initialization scheme on multiple sequence tasks, on which it enables successful training while a standard initialization either fails completely or is orders of magnitude slower. We also observe a beneficial effect on generalization performance using this new initialization.
01	Recent advances in conditional image generation tasks, such as image-to-image translation and image inpainting, are largely accounted to the success of conditional GAN models, which are often optimized by the joint use of the GAN loss with the reconstruction loss. However, we reveal that this training recipe shared by almost all existing methods causes one critical side effect: lack of diversity in output samples. In order to accomplish both training stability and multimodal output generation, we propose novel training schemes with a new set of losses named moment reconstruction losses that simply replace the reconstruction loss. We show that our approach is applicable to any conditional generation tasks by performing thorough experiments on image-to-image translation, super-resolution and image inpainting using Cityscapes and CelebA dataset. Quantitative evaluations also confirm that our methods achieve a great diversity in outputs while retaining or even improving the visual fidelity of generated samples.
10	"We propose a ""Learning to Select"" problem that selects the best among the flexible size candidates. This makes decisions based not only on the properties of the candidate, but also on the environment in which they belong to. For example, job dispatching in the manufacturing factory is a typical ""Learning to Select"" problem. We propose Variable-Length CNN which combines the classification power using hidden features from CNN and the idea of flexible input from Learning to Rank algorithms. This not only can handles flexible candidates using Dynamic Computation Graph, but also is computationally efficient because it only builds a network with the necessary sizes to fit the situation. We applied the algorithm to the job dispatching problem which uses the dispatching log data obtained from the virtual fine-tuned factory. Our proposed algorithm shows considerably better performance than other comparable algorithms."
01	In multiagent systems (MASs), each agent makes individual decisions but all of them contribute globally to the system evolution. Learning in MASs is difficult since each agent's selection of actions must take place in the presence of other co-learning agents. Moreover, the environmental stochasticity and uncertainties increase exponentially with the increase in the number of agents. Previous works borrow various multiagent coordination mechanisms into deep learning architecture to facilitate multiagent coordination. However, none of them explicitly consider action semantics between agents that different actions have different influences on other agents. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, named Action Semantics Network (ASN), that explicitly represents such action semantics between agents. ASN characterizes different actions' influence on other agents using neural networks based on the action semantics between them. ASN can be easily combined with existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to boost their performance. Experimental results on StarCraft II micromanagement and Neural MMO show ASN significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art DRL approaches compared with several network architectures.
10	Design of reliable systems must guarantee stability against input perturbations. In machine learning, such guarantee entails preventing overfitting and ensuring robustness of models against corruption of input data. In order to maximize stability, we analyze and develop a computationally efficient implementation of Jacobian regularization that increases classification margins of neural networks. The stabilizing effect of the Jacobian regularizer leads to significant improvements in robustness, as measured against both random and adversarial input perturbations, without severely degrading generalization properties on clean data.
01	The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task entails an agent following navigational instruction in photo-realistic unknown environments. This challenging task demands that the agent be aware of which instruction was completed, which instruction is needed next, which way to go, and its navigation progress towards the goal. In this paper, we introduce a self-monitoring agent with two complementary components: (1) visual-textual co-grounding module to locate the instruction completed in the past, the instruction required for the next action, and the next moving direction from surrounding images and (2) progress monitor to ensure the grounded instruction correctly reflects the navigation progress. We test our self-monitoring agent on a standard benchmark and analyze our proposed approach through a series of ablation studies that elucidate the contributions of the primary components. Using our proposed method, we set the new state of the art by a significant margin (8% absolute increase in success rate on the unseen test set). Code is available at https://github.com/chihyaoma/selfmonitoring-agent.
10	Words in natural language follow a Zipfian distribution whereby some words are frequent but most are rare. Learning representations for words in the ``long tail'' of this distribution requires enormous amounts of data. Representations of rare words trained directly on end tasks are usually poor, requiring us to pre-train embeddings on external data, or treat all rare words as out-of-vocabulary words with a unique representation. We provide a method for predicting embeddings of rare words on the fly from small amounts of auxiliary data with a network trained end-to-end for the downstream task. We show that this improves results against baselines where embeddings are trained on the end task for reading comprehension, recognizing textual entailment and language modeling.
10	The application of deep recurrent networks to audio transcription has led to impressive gains in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Many have demonstrated that small adversarial perturbations can fool deep neural networks into incorrectly predicting a specified target with high confidence. Current work on fooling ASR systems have focused on white-box attacks, in which the model architecture and parameters are known. In this paper, we adopt a black-box approach to adversarial generation, combining the approaches of both genetic algorithms and gradient estimation to solve the task. We achieve a 89.25% targeted attack similarity after 3000 generations while maintaining 94.6% audio file similarity.
10	New models for natural language understanding have made unusual progress recently, leading to claims of universal text representations. However, current benchmarks are predominantly targeting semantic phenomena;  we make the case that discourse and pragmatics need to take center stage in the evaluation of natural language understanding.We introduce DiscEval, a new benchmark for the evaluation of natural language understanding, that unites 11 discourse-focused evaluation datasets. DiscEval can be used as supplementary training data in a multi-task learning setup, and is publicly available, alongside the code for gathering and preprocessing the datasets.Using our evaluation suite, we show that natural language inference, a widely used pretraining task, does not result in genuinely universal representations, which opens a new challenge for multi-task learning.
01	Low-dimensional vector embeddings, computed using LSTMs or simpler techniques, are a popular approach for capturing the “meaning” of text and a form of unsupervised learning useful for downstream tasks. However, their power is not theoretically understood. The current paper derives formal understanding by looking at the subcase of linear embedding schemes. Using the theory of compressed sensing we show that representations combining the constituent word vectors are essentially information-preserving linear measurements of Bag-of-n-Grams (BonG) representations of text. This leads to a new theoretical result about LSTMs: low-dimensional embeddings derived from a low-memory LSTM are provably at least as powerful on classification tasks, up to small error, as a linear classifier over BonG vectors, a result that extensive empirical work has thus far been unable to show. Our experiments support these theoretical findings and establish strong, simple, and unsupervised baselines on standard benchmarks that in some cases are state of the art among word-level methods. We also show a surprising new property of embeddings such as GloVe and word2vec: they form a good sensing matrix for text that is more efficient than random matrices, the standard sparse recovery tool, which may explain why they lead to better representations in practice.
10	 Learning Invariant Representations to adapt deep classifiers of a source domain to a new target domain has recently attracted much attention. In this paper, we show that the search for invariance favors the compression of representations. We point out this may have a bad impact on adaptability of representations expressed as a minimal combined domain error. By considering the risk of compression, we show that weighting representations can align representation distributions without impacting their adaptability. This supports the claim that representation invariance is too strict a constraint. First, we introduce a new bound on the target risk that reveals a trade-off between compression and invariance of learned representations. More precisely, our results show that the adaptability of a representation can be better controlled when the compression risk is taken into account. In contrast, preserving adaptability may overestimate the risk of compression that makes the bound impracticable. We support these statements with a theoretical analysis illustrated on a standard domain adaptation benchmark. Second, we show that learning weighted representations plays a key role in relaxing the constraint of invariance and then preserving the risk of compression. Taking advantage of this trade-off may open up promising directions for the design of new adaptation methods.
10	Due to the wider availability of modern electronic health records (EHR), patient care data is often being stored in the form of time-series. Clustering such time-series data is crucial for patient phenotyping, anticipating patients’ prognoses by identifying “similar” patients, and designing treatment guidelines that are tailored to homogeneous patient subgroups. In this paper, we develop a deep learning approach for clustering time-series data, where each cluster comprises patients who share similar future outcomes of interest (e.g., adverse events, the onset of comorbidities, etc.). The clustering is carried out by using our novel loss functions that encourage each cluster to have homogeneous future outcomes. We adopt actor-critic models to allow “back-propagation” through the sampling process that is required for assigning clusters to time-series inputs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our model achieves superior clustering performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks and identifies meaningful clusters that can be translated into actionable information for clinical decision-making.
10	Parametric texture models have been applied successfully to synthesize artificial images. Psychophysical studies show that under defined conditions observers are unable to differentiate between model-generated and original natural textures. In industrial applications the reverse case is of interest: a texture analysis system should decide if human observers are able to discriminate between a reference and a novel texture. For example, in case of inspecting decorative surfaces the de- tection of visible texture anomalies without any prior knowledge is required. Here, we implemented a human-vision-inspired novelty detection approach. Assuming that the features used for texture synthesis are important for human texture percep- tion, we compare psychophysical as well as learnt texture representations based on activations of a pretrained CNN in a novelty detection scenario. Additionally, we introduce a novel objective function to train one-class neural networks for novelty detection and compare the results to standard one-class SVM approaches. Our experiments clearly show the differences between human-vision-inspired texture representations and learnt features in detecting visual anomalies. Based on a dig- ital print inspection scenario we show that psychophysical texture representations are able to outperform CNN-encoded features.
10	In this work, we study the connection between regularization and robustness of deep neural networks by viewing them as elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of functions and by regularizing them using the RKHS norm. Even though this norm cannot be computed, we consider various approximations based on upper and lower bounds. These approximations lead to new strategies for regularization, but also to existing ones such as spectral norm penalties or constraints, gradient penalties, or adversarial training. Besides, the kernel framework allows us to obtain margin-based bounds on adversarial generalization. We show that our new algorithms lead to empirical benefits for learning on small datasets and learning adversarially robust models. We also discuss implications of our regularization framework for learning implicit generative models.
10	Graph classification is currently dominated by graph kernels, which, while powerful, suffer some significant limitations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer a very appealing alternative. However, processing graphs with CNNs is not trivial. To address this challenge, many sophisticated extensions of CNNs have recently been proposed. In this paper, we reverse the problem: rather than proposing yet another graph CNN model, we introduce a novel way to represent graphs as multi-channel image-like structures that allows them to be handled by vanilla 2D CNNs. Despite its simplicity, our method proves very competitive to state-of-the-art graph kernels and graph CNNs, and outperforms them by a wide margin on some datasets. It is also preferable to graph kernels in terms of time complexity. Code and data are publicly available.
01	Domain adaptation refers to the problem of leveraging labeled data in a source domain to learn an accurate model in a target domain where labels are scarce or unavailable. A recent approach for finding a common representation of the two domains is via domain adversarial training (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015), which attempts to induce a feature extractor that matches the source and target feature distributions in some feature space. However, domain adversarial training faces two critical limitations: 1) if the feature extraction function has high-capacity, then feature distribution matching is a weak constraint, 2) in non-conservative domain adaptation (where no single classifier can perform well in both the source and target domains), training the model to do well on the source domain hurts performance on the target domain. In this paper, we address these issues through the lens of the cluster assumption, i.e., decision boundaries should not cross high-density data regions. We propose two novel and related models: 1) the Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation (VADA) model, which combines domain adversarial training with a penalty term that punishes the violation the cluster assumption; 2) the Decision-boundary Iterative Refinement Training with a Teacher (DIRT-T) model, which takes the VADA model as initialization and employs natural gradient steps to further minimize the cluster assumption violation. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that the combination of these two models significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance on the digit, traffic sign, and Wi-Fi recognition domain adaptation benchmarks.
10	Meta-learning is a powerful tool that learns how to quickly adapt a model to new tasks. In the context of reinforcement learning, meta-learning algorithms can acquire reinforcement learning procedures to solve new problems more efficiently by meta-learning prior tasks. The performance of meta-learning algorithms critically depends on the tasks available for meta-training: in the same way that supervised learning algorithms generalize best to test points drawn from the same distribution as the training points, meta-learning methods generalize best to tasks from the same distribution as the meta-training tasks. In effect, meta-reinforcement learning offloads the design burden from algorithm design to task design. If we can automate the process of task design as well, we can devise a meta-learning algorithm that is truly automated. In this work, we take a step in this direction, proposing a family of unsupervised meta-learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. We describe a general recipe for unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning, and describe an effective instantiation of this approach based on a recently proposed unsupervised exploration technique and model-agnostic meta-learning. We also discuss practical and conceptual considerations for developing unsupervised meta-learning methods. Our experimental results demonstrate that unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning effectively acquires accelerated reinforcement learning procedures without the need for manual task design, significantly exceeds the performance of learning from scratch, and even matches performance of meta-learning methods that use hand-specified task distributions.
01	Answering complex logical queries on large-scale incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) is a fundamental yet challenging task. Recently, a promising approach to this problem has been to embed KG entities as well as the query into a vector space such that entities that answer the query are embedded close to the query. However, prior work models queries as single points in the vector space, which is problematic because a complex query represents a potentially large set of its answer entities, but it is unclear how such a set can be represented as a single point. Furthermore, prior work can only handle queries that use conjunctions ($\wedge$) and existential quantifiers ($\exists$). Handling queries with logical disjunctions ($\vee$) remains an open problem. Here we propose query2box, an embedding-based framework for reasoning over arbitrary queries with $\wedge$, $\vee$, and $\exists$ operators in massive and incomplete KGs. Our main insight is that queries can be embedded as boxes (i.e., hyper-rectangles), where a set of points inside the box corresponds to a set of answer entities of the query. We show that conjunctions can be naturally represented as intersections of boxes and also prove a negative result that handling disjunctions would require embedding with dimension proportional to the number of KG entities. However, we show that by transforming queries into a Disjunctive Normal Form, query2box is capable of handling arbitrary logical queries with $\wedge$, $\vee$, $\exists$ in a scalable manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of query2box on two large KGs and show that query2box achieves up to 25% relative improvement over the state of the art.
10	The emergence of language in multi-agent settings is a promising research direction to ground natural language in simulated agents. If AI would be able to understand the meaning of language through its using it, it could also transfer it to other situations flexibly. That is seen as an important step towards achieving general AI. The scope of emergent communication is so far, however, still limited. It is necessary to enhance the learning possibilities for skills associated with communication to increase the emergable complexity. We took an example from human language acquisition and the importance of the empathic connection in this process. We propose an approach to introduce the notion of empathy to multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. We extend existing approaches on referential games with an auxiliary task for the speaker to predict the listener's mind change improving the learning time. Our experiments show the high potential of this architectural element by doubling the learning speed of the test setup. 
01	Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) operate with asynchronous discrete events (or spikes) which can potentially lead to higher energy-efficiency in neuromorphic hardware implementations. Many works have shown that an SNN for inference can be formed by copying the weights from a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and setting the firing threshold for each layer as the maximum input received in that layer. These type of converted SNNs require a large number of time steps to achieve competitive accuracy which diminishes the energy savings. The number of time steps can be reduced by training SNNs with spike-based backpropagation from scratch, but that is computationally expensive and slow. To address these challenges, we present a computationally-efficient training technique for deep SNNs. We propose a hybrid training methodology: 1) take a converted SNN and use its weights and thresholds as an initialization step for spike-based backpropagation, and 2) perform incremental spike-timing dependent backpropagation (STDB) on this carefully initialized network to obtain an SNN that converges within few epochs and requires fewer time steps for input processing. STDB is performed with a novel surrogate gradient function defined using neuron's spike time. The weight update is proportional to the difference in spike timing between the current time step and the most recent time step the neuron generated an output spike. The SNNs trained with our hybrid conversion-and-STDB training perform at $10{\times}{-}25{\times}$ fewer number of time steps and achieve similar accuracy compared to purely converted SNNs. The proposed training methodology converges in less than $20$ epochs of spike-based backpropagation for most standard image classification datasets, thereby greatly reducing the training complexity compared to training SNNs from scratch. We perform experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets for both VGG and ResNet architectures. We achieve top-1 accuracy of $65.19\%$ for ImageNet dataset on SNN with $250$ time steps, which is $10{\times}$ faster compared to converted SNNs with similar accuracy.
10	Skip connections are increasingly utilized by deep neural networks to improve accuracy and cost-efficiency. In particular, the recent DenseNet is efficient in computation and parameters, and achieves state-of-the-art predictions by directly connecting each feature layer to all previous ones. However, DenseNet's extreme connectivity pattern may hinder its scalability to high depths, and in applications like fully convolutional networks, full DenseNet connections are prohibitively expensive. This work first experimentally shows that one key advantage of skip connections is to have short distances among feature layers during backpropagation. Specifically, using a fixed number of skip connections, the connection patterns with shorter backpropagation distance among layers have more accurate predictions. Following this insight, we propose a connection template, Log-DenseNet, which, in comparison to DenseNet,  only slightly increases the backpropagation distances among layers from 1 to  ($1 + \log_2 L$), but uses only $L\log_2 L$ total connections instead of $O(L^2)$. Hence, \logdenses are easier to scale than DenseNets, and no longer require careful GPU memory management. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design principle by showing better performance than DenseNets on tabula rasa semantic segmentation, and competitive results on visual recognition.
01	It has been established that diverse behaviors spanning the controllable subspace of a Markov decision process can be trained by rewarding a policy for being distinguishable from other policies. However, one limitation of this formulation is the difficulty to generalize beyond the finite set of behaviors being explicitly learned, as may be needed in subsequent tasks. Successor features provide an appealing solution to this generalization problem, but require defining the reward function as linear in some grounded feature space. In this paper, we show that these two techniques can be combined, and that each method solves the other's primary limitation. To do so we introduce Variational Intrinsic Successor FeatuRes (VISR), a novel algorithm which learns controllable features that can be leveraged to provide enhanced generalization and fast task inference through the successor features framework. We empirically validate VISR on the full Atari suite, in a novel setup wherein the rewards are only exposed briefly after a long unsupervised phase. Achieving human-level performance on 12 games and beating all baselines, we believe VISR represents a step towards agents that rapidly learn from limited feedback.
10	Hierarchical graph representation learning is an emerging subject owing to the increasingly popular adoption of graph neural networks in machine learning and applications. Loosely speaking, work under this umbrella falls into two categories: (a) use a predefined graph hierarchy to perform pooling; and (b) learn the hierarchy for a given graph through differentiable parameterization of the coarsening process. These approaches are supervised; a predictive task with ground-truth labels is used to drive the learning. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach, \textsc{BayesPool}, with the use of variational Bayes. It produces graph representations given a predefined hierarchy. Rather than relying on labels, the training signal comes from the evidence lower bound of encoding a graph and decoding the subsequent one in the hierarchy. Node features are treated latent in this variational machinery, so that they are produced as a byproduct and are used in downstream tasks. We demonstrate a comprehensive set of experiments to show the usefulness of the learned representation in the context of graph classification.
01	Kronecker-factor Approximate Curvature (Martens & Grosse, 2015) (K-FAC) is a 2nd-order optimization method which has been shown to give state-of-the-art performance on large-scale neural network optimization tasks (Ba et al., 2017).  It is based on an approximation to the Fisher information matrix (FIM) that makes assumptions about the particular structure of the network and the way it is parameterized. The original K-FAC method was applicable only to fully-connected networks, although it has been recently extended by Grosse & Martens (2016) to handle convolutional networks as well. In this work we extend the method to handle RNNs by introducing a novel approximation to the FIM for RNNs. This approximation works by modelling the covariance structure between the gradient contributions at different time-steps using a chain-structured linear Gaussian graphical model, summing the various cross-covariances, and computing the inverse in closed form. We demonstrate in experiments that our method significantly outperforms general purpose state-of-the-art optimizers like SGD with momentum and Adam on several challenging RNN training tasks.
10	The capability of reliably detecting out-of-distribution samples is one of the key factors in deploying a good classifier, as the test distribution always does not match with the training distribution in most real-world applications. In this work, we propose a deep generative classifier which is effective to detect out-of-distribution samples as well as classify in-distribution samples, by integrating the concept of Gaussian discriminant analysis into deep neural networks. Unlike the discriminative (or softmax) classifier that only focuses on the decision boundary partitioning its latent space into multiple regions, our generative classifier aims to explicitly model class-conditional distributions as separable Gaussian distributions. Thereby, we can define the confidence score by the distance between a test sample and the center of each distribution. Our empirical evaluation on multi-class images and tabular data demonstrate that the generative classifier achieves the best performances in distinguishing out-of-distribution samples, and also it can be generalized well for various types of deep neural networks.
01	We propose a novel regularizer to improve the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The motivation is that when the discriminator D spreads out its model capacity in the right way, the learning signals given to the generator G are more informative and diverse, which helps G to explore better and discover the real data manifold while avoiding large unstable jumps due to the erroneous extrapolation made by D . Our regularizer guides the rectifier discriminator D to better allocate its model capacity, by encouraging the binary activation patterns on selected internal layers of D to have a high joint entropy. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate improvements in stability and convergence speed of the GAN training, as well as higher sample quality. The approach also leads to higher classification accuracies in semi-supervised learning.
01	Spectral clustering is a leading and popular technique in unsupervised data analysis.  Two of its major limitations are scalability and generalization of the spectral embedding (i.e., out-of-sample-extension). In this paper we introduce a deep learning approach to spectral clustering that overcomes the above shortcomings. Our network, which we call SpectralNet, learns a map that embeds input data points into the eigenspace of their associated graph Laplacian matrix and subsequently clusters them. We train SpectralNet using a procedure that involves constrained stochastic optimization. Stochastic optimization allows it to scale to large datasets, while the constraints, which are implemented using a special purpose output layer, allow us to keep the network output orthogonal. Moreover, the map learned by SpectralNet naturally generalizes the spectral embedding to unseen data points. To further improve the quality of the clustering, we replace the standard pairwise Gaussian affinities with affinities leaned from unlabeled data using a Siamese network.  Additional improvement can be achieved by applying the network to code representations produced, e.g., by standard autoencoders. Our end-to-end learning procedure is fully unsupervised. In addition, we apply VC dimension theory to derive a lower bound on the size of  SpectralNet.  State-of-the-art clustering results are reported for both the MNIST and Reuters datasets.
10	It has been argued that current machine learning models do not have commonsense, and therefore must be hard-coded with prior knowledge (Marcus, 2018). Here we show surprising evidence that language models can already learn to capture certain common sense knowledge. Our key observation is that a language model can compute the probability of any statement, and this probability can be used to evaluate the truthfulness of that statement.  On the Winograd Schema Challenge (Levesque et al., 2011), language models are 11% higher in accuracy than previous state-of-the-art supervised methods. Language models can also be fine-tuned for the task of Mining Commonsense Knowledge on ConceptNet to achieve an F1 score of 0.912 and 0.824, outperforming previous best results (Jastrzebskiet al., 2018).  Further analysis demonstrates that language models can discover unique features of Winograd Schema contexts that decide the correct answers without explicit supervision.
10	Effective defense of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks remains a challenging problem, especially under white-box attacks.In this paper, we develop a new generative cleaning network  with quantized nonlinear transform  for effective defense of deep neural networks.  The generative cleaning network, equipped with a trainable quantized nonlinear  transform block, is able to destroy the sophisticated noise pattern of adversarial attacks and recover the original image content. The generative cleaning network and attack detector network are jointly trained using adversarial learning  to minimize both perceptual loss and adversarial loss. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-art methods by large margins in both white-box and black-box attacks. For example, it improves the classification accuracy for white-box attacks upon the second best method by more than 40\% on the SVHN dataset and more than 20\% on the challenging CIFAR-10 dataset. 
10	We consider the task of automated theorem proving, a key AI task. Deep learning has shown promise for training theorem provers, but there are limited human-written theorems and proofs available for supervised learning. To address this limitation, we propose to learn a neural generator that automatically synthesizes theorems and proofs for the purpose of training a theorem prover. Experiments on real-world  tasks demonstrate that synthetic data from our approach significantly improves the theorem prover and advances the state of the art of automated theorem proving in Metamath.
10	Knowledge Graphs (KG), composed of entities and relations, provide a structured representation of knowledge. For easy access to statistical approaches on relational data, multiple methods to embed a KG as components of R^d have been introduced. We propose TransINT, a novel and interpretable KG embedding method that isomorphically preserves the implication ordering among relations in the embedding space. TransINT maps set of entities (tied by a relation) to continuous sets of vectors that are inclusion-ordered isomorphically to relation implications. With a novel parameter sharing scheme, TransINT enables automatic training on missing but implied facts without rule grounding. We achieve new state-of-the-art performances with signficant margins in Link Prediction and Triple Classification on FB122 dataset, with boosted performance even on test instances that cannot be inferred by logical rules. The angles between the continuous sets embedded by TransINT provide an interpretable way to mine semantic relatedness and implication rules among relations. 
01	We propose a novel algorithm for learning fair representations that can simultaneously mitigate two notions of disparity among different demographic subgroups in the classification setting. Two key components underpinning the design of our algorithm are balanced error rate and conditional alignment of representations. We show how these two components contribute to ensuring accuracy parity and equalized false-positive and false-negative rates across groups without impacting demographic parity. Furthermore, we also demonstrate both in theory and on two real-world experiments that the proposed algorithm leads to a better utility-fairness trade-off on balanced datasets compared with existing algorithms on learning fair representations for classification. 
10	Inspired by the advances in biological science, the study of sparse binary projection models has attracted considerable recent research attention. The models project dense input samples into a higher-dimensional space and output sparse binary data representations after Winner-Take-All competition, subject to the constraint that the projection matrix is also sparse and binary. Following the work along this line, we developed a supervised-WTA model when training samples with both input and output representations are available, from which the optimal projection matrix can be obtained with a simple, efficient yet effective algorithm. We further extended the model and the algorithm to an unsupervised setting where only the input representation of the samples is available. In a series of empirical evaluation on similarity search tasks, the proposed models reported significantly improved results over the state-of-the-art methods in both search accuracy and running time. The successful results give us strong confidence that the work provides a highly practical tool to real world applications.
01	L$_2$ regularization and weight decay regularization are equivalent for standard stochastic gradient descent (when rescaled by the learning rate), but as we demonstrate this is \emph{not} the case for adaptive gradient algorithms, such as Adam. While common implementations of these algorithms employ L$_2$ regularization (often calling it ``weight decay'' in what may be misleading due to the inequivalence we expose), we propose a simple modification to recover the original formulation of weight decay regularization by \emph{decoupling} the weight decay from the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter). Our proposed decoupled weight decay has already been adopted by many researchers, and the community has implemented it in TensorFlow and PyTorch; the complete source code for our experiments is available at \url{https://github.com/loshchil/AdamW-and-SGDW}
01	The vertebrate visual system is hierarchically organized to process visual information in successive stages. Neural representations vary drastically across the first stages of visual processing: at the output of the retina, ganglion cell receptive fields (RFs) exhibit a clear antagonistic center-surround structure, whereas in the primary visual cortex (V1), typical RFs are sharply tuned to a precise orientation. There is currently no unified theory explaining these differences in representations across layers. Here, using a deep convolutional neural network trained on image recognition as a model of the visual system, we show that such differences in representation can emerge as a direct consequence of different neural resource constraints on the retinal and cortical networks, and for the first time we find a single model from which both geometries spontaneously emerge at the appropriate stages of visual processing. The key constraint is a reduced number of neurons at the retinal output, consistent with the anatomy of the optic nerve as a stringent bottleneck. Second, we find that, for simple downstream cortical networks, visual representations at the retinal output emerge as nonlinear and lossy feature detectors, whereas they emerge as linear and faithful encoders of the visual scene for more complex cortical networks. This result predicts that the retinas of small vertebrates (e.g. salamander, frog) should perform sophisticated nonlinear computations, extracting features directly relevant to behavior, whereas retinas of large animals such as primates should mostly encode the visual scene linearly and respond to a much broader range of stimuli. These predictions could reconcile the two seemingly incompatible views of the retina as either performing feature extraction or efficient coding of natural scenes, by suggesting that all vertebrates lie on a spectrum between these two objectives, depending on the degree of neural resources allocated to their visual system.
10	We propose the dense RNN, which has the fully connections from each hidden state to multiple preceding hidden states of all layers directly. As the density of the connection increases, the number of paths through which the gradient flows can be increased. It increases the magnitude of gradients, which help to prevent the vanishing gradient problem in time. Larger gradients, however, can also cause exploding gradient problem. To complement the trade-off between two problems, we propose an attention gate, which controls the amounts of gradient flows. We describe the relation between the attention gate and the gradient flows by approximation. The experiment on the language modeling using Penn Treebank corpus shows dense connections with the attention gate improve the model’s performance.
10	In distributed training, the communication cost due to the transmission of gradientsor the parameters of the deep model is a major bottleneck in scaling up the numberof processing nodes. To address this issue, we propose dithered quantization forthe transmission of the stochastic gradients and show that training with DitheredQuantized Stochastic Gradients (DQSG) is similar to the training with unquantizedSGs perturbed by an independent bounded uniform noise, in contrast to the otherquantization methods where the perturbation depends on the gradients and hence,complicating the convergence analysis. We study the convergence of trainingalgorithms using DQSG and the trade off between the number of quantizationlevels and the training time. Next, we observe that there is a correlation among theSGs computed by workers that can be utilized to further reduce the communicationoverhead without any performance loss. Hence, we develop a simple yet effectivequantization scheme, nested dithered quantized SG (NDQSG), that can reduce thecommunication significantly without requiring the workers communicating extrainformation to each other. We prove that although NDQSG requires significantlyless bits, it can achieve the same quantization variance bound as DQSG. Oursimulation results confirm the effectiveness of training using DQSG and NDQSGin reducing the communication bits or the convergence time compared to theexisting methods without sacrificing the accuracy of the trained model.
10	Dialogue research tends to distinguish between chit-chat and goal-oriented tasks. While the former is arguably more naturalistic and has a wider use of language, the latter has clearer metrics and a more straightforward learning signal. Humans effortlessly combine the two, and engage in chit-chat for example with the goal of exchanging information or eliciting a specific response. Here, we bridge the divide between these two domains in the setting of a rich multi-player text-based fantasy environment where agents and humans engage in both actions and dialogue. Specifically, we train a goal-oriented model with reinforcement learning via self-play against an imitation-learned chit-chat model with two new approaches: the policy either learns to pick a topic or learns to pick an utterance given the top-k utterances. We show that both models outperform a strong inverse model baseline and can converse naturally with their dialogue partner in order to achieve goals.
01	Humans learn to solve tasks of increasing complexity by building on top of previously acquired knowledge. Typically, there exists a natural progression in the tasks that we learn – most do not require completely independent solutions, but can be broken down into simpler subtasks. We propose to represent a solver for each task as a neural module that calls existing modules (solvers for simpler tasks) in a functional program-like manner. Lower modules are a black box to the calling module, and communicate only via a query and an output. Thus, a module for a new task learns to query existing modules and composes their outputs in order to produce its own output. Our model effectively combines previous skill-sets, does not suffer from forgetting, and is fully differentiable. We test our model in learning a set of visual reasoning tasks, and demonstrate improved performances in all tasks by learning progressively. By evaluating the reasoning process using human judges, we show that our model is more interpretable than an attention-based baseline.
01	Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been found to be surprisingly effective in training a variety of deep neural networks. However, there is still a lack of understanding on how and why SGD can train these complex networks towards a global minimum. In this study, we establish the convergence of SGD to a global minimum for nonconvex optimization problems that are commonly encountered in neural network training. Our argument exploits the following two important properties: 1) the training loss can achieve zero value (approximately), which has been widely observed in deep learning; 2) SGD follows a star-convex path, which is verified by various experiments in this paper.  In such a context, our analysis shows that SGD, although has long been considered as a randomized algorithm, converges in an intrinsically deterministic manner to a global minimum. 
10	Federated learning is a recent advance in privacy protection. In this context, a trusted curator aggregates parameters optimized in decentralized fashion by multiple clients. The resulting model is then distributed back to all clients, ultimately converging to a joint representative model without explicitly having to share the data. However, the protocol is vulnerable to differential attacks, which could originate from any party contributing during federated optimization. In such an attack, a client's contribution during training and information about their data set is revealed through analyzing the distributed model. We tackle this problem and propose an algorithm for client sided differential privacy preserving federated optimization. The aim is to hide clients' contributions during training, balancing the trade-off between privacy loss and model performance. Empirical studies suggest that given a sufficiently large number of participating clients, our proposed procedure can maintain client-level differential privacy at only a minor cost in model performance. 
01	Short-and-sparse deconvolution (SaSD) is the problem of extracting localized, recurring motifs in signals with spatial or temporal structure. Variants of this problem arise in applications such as image deblurring, microscopy, neural spike sorting, and more. The problem is challenging in both theory and practice, as natural optimization formulations are nonconvex. Moreover, practical deconvolution problems involve smooth motifs (kernels) whose spectra decay rapidly, resulting in poor conditioning and numerical challenges. This paper is motivated by recent theoretical advances \citep{zhang2017global,kuo2019geometry}, which characterize the optimization landscape of a particular nonconvex formulation of SaSD. This is used to derive a provable algorithm that exactly solves certain non-practical instances of the SaSD problem. We leverage the key ideas from this theory (sphere constraints, data-driven initialization) to develop a practical algorithm, which performs well on data arising from a range of application areas. We highlight key additional challenges posed by the ill-conditioning of real SaSD problems and suggest heuristics (acceleration, continuation, reweighting) to mitigate them. Experiments demonstrate the performance and generality of the proposed method.
10	Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn a dynamic model to reduce the number of interactions with real-world environments. However, due to estimation error, rollouts in the learned model, especially those of long horizon, fail to match the ones in real-world environments. This mismatching has seriously impacted the sample complexity of MBRL. The phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that previous works employ supervised learning to learn the one-step transition models, which has inherent difficulty ensuring the matching of distributions from multi-step rollouts. Based on the claim, we propose to learn the synthesized model by matching the distributions of multi-step rollouts sampled from the synthesized model and the real ones via WGAN. We theoretically show that matching the two can minimize the difference of cumulative rewards between the real transition and the learned one. Our experiments also show that the proposed model imitation method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of sample complexity and average return.
10	We demonstrate the possibility of what we call sparse learning: accelerated training of deep neural networks that maintain sparse weights throughout training while achieving dense performance levels. We accomplish this by developing sparse momentum, an algorithm which uses exponentially smoothed gradients (momentum) to identify layers and weights which reduce the error efficiently. Sparse momentum redistributes pruned weights across layers according to the mean momentum magnitude of each layer. Within a layer, sparse momentum grows weights according to the momentum magnitude of zero-valued weights. We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, decreasing the mean error by a relative 8%, 15%, and 6% compared to other sparse algorithms. Furthermore, we show that sparse momentum reliably reproduces dense performance levels while providing up to 5.61x faster training. In our analysis, ablations show that the benefits of momentum redistribution and growth increase with the depth and size of the network. 
10	This paper studies similarity search, which is a crucial enabler of many feature vector--based applications. The problem of similarity search has been extensively studied in the machine learning community. Recent advances of proximity graphs have achieved outstanding performance through exploiting the navigability of the underlying graph structure. In this work, we introduce the annealable proximity graph (APG) method to learn and reshape proximity graphs for efficiency and effective similarity search. APG makes proximity graph edges annealable, which can be effectively trained with a stochastic optimization algorithm. APG identifies important edges that best preserve graph navigability and prune inferior edges without drastically changing graph properties. Experimental results show that APG achieves state-of-the-art results not only by producing proximity graphs with less number of edges but also speeding up the search time by 20--40\% across different datasets with almost no loss of accuracy.
10	In this paper, we study the representational power of deep neural networks (DNN) that belong to the family of piecewise-linear (PWL) functions, based on PWL activation units such as rectifier or maxout. We investigate the complexity of such networks by studying the number of linear regions of the PWL function. Typically, a PWL function from a DNN can be seen as a large family of linear functions acting on millions of such regions. We directly build upon the work of Mont´ufar et al. (2014), Mont´ufar (2017), and Raghu et al. (2017) by refining the upper and lower bounds on the number of linear regions for rectified and maxout networks. In addition to achieving tighter bounds, we also develop a novel method to perform exact numeration or counting of the number of linear regions with a mixed-integer linear formulation that maps the input space to output. We use this new capability to visualize how the number of linear regions change while training DNNs.  
10	In real-world underwater environment, exploration of seabed resources, underwater archaeology, and underwater fishing rely on a variety of sensors, vision sensor is the most important one due to its high information content, non-intrusive, and passive nature. However, wavelength-dependent light attenuation and back-scattering result in color distortion and haze effect, which degrade the visibility of images. To address this problem, firstly, we proposed an unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating realistic underwater images (color distortion and haze effect simulation) from in-air image and depth map pairs. Secondly, U-Net, which is trained efficiently using synthetic underwater dataset, is adopted for color restoration and de-hazing. Our model directly reconstructs underwater clear images using end-to-end autoencoder networks, while maintaining scene content structural similarity. The results obtained by our method were compared with existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Experimental results on open real-world underwater datasets demonstrate that the presented method performs well on different actual underwater scenes, and the processing speed can reach up to 125FPS on images running on one NVIDIA 1060 GPU.
01	The impressive performance of neural networks on natural language processing tasks attributes to their ability to model complicated word and phrase compositions. To explain how the model handles semantic compositions, we study hierarchical explanation of neural network predictions. We identify non-additivity and context independent importance attributions within hierarchies as two desirable properties for highlighting word and phrase compositions. We show some prior efforts on hierarchical explanations, e.g. contextual decomposition, do not satisfy the desired properties mathematically, leading to inconsistent explanation quality in different models. In this paper, we start by proposing a formal and general way to quantify the importance of each word and phrase. Following the formulation, we propose Sampling and Contextual Decomposition (SCD) algorithm and Sampling and Occlusion (SOC) algorithm. Human and metrics evaluation on both LSTM models and BERT Transformer models on multiple datasets show that our algorithms outperform prior hierarchical explanation algorithms. Our algorithms help to visualize semantic composition captured by models, extract classification rules and improve human trust of models.
10	Neural networks have significantly benefitted real-world tasks. The universality of a neural network enables the approximation of any type of continuous functions. However, a neural network is regarded as a non-interpretable black box model, and this is fatal to reverse engineering as the main goal of reverse engineering is to reveal the structure or design of a target function instead of approximating it. Therefore, we propose a new type of a function constructing network, called the white box network. This network arranges function blocks to construct a target function to reveal its design. The network uses discretized layers, thus rendering the model interpretable without disordering the function blocks. Additionally, we introduce an end-to-end PathNet structure through this discretization by considering the function blocks as neural networks
10	Lifelong learning poses considerable challenges in terms of effectiveness (minimizing prediction errors for all tasks) and overall computational tractability for real-time performance.  This paper addresses continuous lifelong multitask learning by jointly re-estimating the inter-task relations (\textit{output} kernel) and the per-task model parameters at each round, assuming data arrives in a streaming fashion. We propose a novel algorithm called  \textit{Online Output Kernel Learning Algorithm} (OOKLA) for lifelong learning setting. To avoid the memory explosion, we propose a robust budget-limited versions of the proposed algorithm that efficiently utilize the relationship between the tasks to bound the total number of representative examples in the support set.  In addition, we propose a two-stage budgeted scheme for efficiently tackling the task-specific budget constraints in lifelong learning. Our empirical results over three datasets indicate superior AUC performance for OOKLA and its budget-limited cousins over strong baselines.
01	This paper proposes a new actor-critic-style algorithm called Dual Actor-Critic or Dual-AC.  It is derived in a principled way from the Lagrangian dual form of the Bellman optimality equation, which can be viewed as a two-player game between the actor and a critic-like function, which is named as dual critic.  Compared to its actor-critic relatives, Dual-AC has the desired property that the actor and dual critic are updated cooperatively to optimize the same objective function, providing a more transparent way for learning the critic that is directly related to the objective function of the actor. We then provide a concrete algorithm that can effectively solve the minimax optimization problem, using techniques of multi-step bootstrapping, path regularization, and stochastic dual ascent algorithm. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performances across several benchmarks.
10	Extending the capabilities of robotics to real-world complex, unstructured environments requires the capability of developing better perception systems while maintaining low sample complexity. When dealing with high-dimensional state spaces, current methods are either model-free, or model-based with reconstruction based objectives. The sample inefficiency of the former constitutes a major barrier for applying them to the real-world. While the latter present low sample complexity, they learn latent spaces that need to reconstruct every single detail of the scene. Real-world environments are unstructured and cluttered with objects. Capturing all the variability on the latent representation harms its applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we present mutual information maximization for robust plannable representations (MIRO), an information theoretic representational learning objective for model-based reinforcement learning. Our objective optimizes for a latent space that maximizes the mutual information with future observations and emphasizes the relevant aspects of the dynamics, which allows to capture all the information needed for planning.We show that our approach learns a latent representation that in cluttered scenes focuses on the task relevant features, ignoring the irrelevant aspects. At the same time, state-of-the-art methods with reconstruction objectives are unable to learn in such environments.
10	Up until very recently, inspired by a mass of researches on adversarial examples for computer vision, there has been a growing interest in designing adversarial attacks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, followed by very few works of adversarial defenses for NLP. To our knowledge, there exists no defense method against the successful synonym substitution based attacks that aim to satisfy all the lexical, grammatical, semantic constraints and thus are hard to perceived by humans. We contribute to fill this gap and propose a novel adversarial defense method called Synonym Encoding Method (SEM), which inserts an encoder before the input layer of the model and then trains the model to eliminate adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEM can efficiently defend current best synonym substitution based adversarial attacks with little decay on the accuracy for benign examples. To better evaluate SEM, we also design a strong attack method called Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) that adopts the genetic metaheuristic for synonym substitution based attacks. Compared with existing genetic based adversarial attack, IGA can achieve higher attack success rate while maintaining the transferability of the adversarial examples.
10	We propose local prior matching (LPM), a self-supervised objective for speech recognition. The LPM objective leverages a strong language model to provide learning signal given unlabeled speech. Since LPM uses a language model, it can take advantage of vast quantities of both unpaired text and speech. The loss is theoretically well-motivated and simple to implement. More importantly, LPM is effective. Starting from a model trained on 100 hours of labeled speech, with an additional 360 hours of unlabeled data LPM reduces the WER by 26% and 31% relative on a clean and noisy test set, respectively. This bridges the gap by 54% and 73% WER on the two test sets relative to a fully supervised model on the same 360 hours with labels. By augmenting LPM with an additional 500 hours of noisy data, we further improve the WER on the noisy test set by 15% relative. Furthermore, we perform extensive ablative studies to show the importance of various configurations of our self-supervised approach.
01	Deep latent variable models are powerful tools for representation learning. In this paper, we adopt the deep information bottleneck model, identify its shortcomings and propose a model that circumvents them. To this end, we apply a copula transformation which, by restoring the invariance properties of the information bottleneck method, leads to disentanglement of the features in the latent space. Building on that, we show how this transformation translates to sparsity of the latent space in the new model.  We evaluate our method on artificial and real data.
10	Targeted clean-label poisoning is a type of adversarial attack on machine learning systems where the adversary injects a few correctly-labeled, minimally-perturbed samples into the training data thus causing the deployed model to misclassify a particular test sample during inference. Although defenses have been proposed for general poisoning attacks (those which aim to reduce overall test accuracy), no reliable defense for clean-label attacks has been demonstrated, despite the attacks' effectiveness and their realistic use cases. In this work, we propose a set of simple, yet highly-effective defenses against these attacks. We test our proposed approach against two recently published clean-label poisoning attacks, both of which use the CIFAR-10 dataset. After reproducing their experiments, we demonstrate that our defenses are able to detect over 99% of poisoning examples in both attacks and remove them without any compromise on model performance. Our simple defenses show that current clean-label poisoning attack strategies can be annulled, and serve as strong but simple-to-implement baseline defense for which to test future clean-label poisoning attacks.
10	We develop a probabilistic extension of state-of-the-art embedding models for link prediction in relational knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs are collections of relational facts, where each fact states that a certain relation holds between two entities, such as people, places, or objects. We argue that knowledge graphs should be treated within a Bayesian framework because even large knowledge graphs typically contain only few facts per entity, leading effectively to a small data problem where parameter uncertainty matters. We introduce a probabilistic reinterpretation of the DistMult (Yang et al., 2015) and ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016) models and employ variational inference to estimate a lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the data. We find that the main benefit of the Bayesian approach is that it allows for efficient, gradient based optimization over hyperparameters, which would lead to divergences in a non-Bayesian treatment. Models with such learned hyperparameters improve over the state-of-the-art by a significant margin, as we demonstrate on several benchmarks.
10	We present a novel architecture of GAN for a disentangled representation learning. The new model architecture is inspired by Information Bottleneck (IB) theory thereby named IB-GAN. IB-GAN objective is similar to that of InfoGAN but has a crucial difference; a capacity regularization for mutual information is adopted, thanks to which the generator of IB-GAN can harness a latent representation in disentangled and interpretable manner. To facilitate the optimization of IB-GAN in practice, a new variational upper-bound is derived. With experiments on CelebA, 3DChairs, and dSprites datasets, we demonstrate that the visual quality of samples generated by IB-GAN is often better than those by β-VAEs. Moreover, IB-GAN achieves much higher disentanglement metrics score than β-VAEs or InfoGAN on the dSprites dataset.
01	We derive an unbiased estimator for expectations over discrete random variables based on sampling without replacement, which reduces variance as it avoids duplicate samples. We show that our estimator can be derived as the Rao-Blackwellization of three different estimators. Combining our estimator with REINFORCE, we obtain a policy gradient estimator and we reduce its variance using a built-in control variate which is obtained without additional model evaluations. The resulting estimator is closely related to other gradient estimators. Experiments with a toy problem, a categorical Variational Auto-Encoder and a structured prediction problem show that our estimator is the only estimator that is consistently among the best estimators in both high and low entropy settings.
10	Medical images may contain various types of artifacts with different patterns and mixtures, which depend on many factors such as scan setting, machine condition, patients’ characteristics, surrounding environment, etc. However, existing deep learning based artifact reduction methods are restricted by their training set with specific predetermined artifact type and pattern. As such, they have limited clinical adoption. In this paper, we introduce a “Zero-Shot” medical image Artifact Reduction (ZSAR) framework, which leverages the power of deep learning but without using general pre-trained networks or any clean image reference. Specifically, we utilize the low internal visual entropy of an image and train a light-weight image-specific artifact reduction network to reduce artifacts in an image at test-time. We use Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as vehicles to show that ZSAR can reduce artifacts better than state-of-the-art both qualitatively and quantitatively, while using shorter execution time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning framework that reduces artifacts in medical images without using a priori training set.
10	Anomaly detection and localization is a popular computer vision problem which involves detecting anomalous images and localizing anomalies within them. However, this task is challenging due to small sample size and pixel coverage of the anomaly in real-world scenarios. Previous works have a drawback of using anomalous images to compute a threshold during training to detect and localize anomalies. To tackle these issues, we propose AVAGA - the first end-to-end trainable convolutional adversarial variational autoencoder (CAVAE) framework using guided attention which localizes the anomaly with the help of attention maps. AVAGA detects an image as anomalous from the large pixel-wise difference between the input and reconstructed image. In an unsupervised setting, we propose a guided attention loss, where we encourage AVAGA to focus on all non-anomalous regions in the image without using any anomalous images during training. Furthermore, we also propose a selective gradient backpropagation technique for guided attention, which enhances the performance of anomaly localization while using only 2% anomalous images in a weakly supervised setting. AVAGA outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods by 10% and 18% on localization and 8% and 15% on classification accuracy in unsupervised and weakly supervised settings respectively on Mvtec Anomaly Detection (MvAD) dataset and by 11% and 22% on localization and 10% and 19% on classification accuracy in unsupervised and weakly supervised settings respectively on the modified ShanghaiTech Campus (STC) dataset
01	We present Optimal Transport GAN (OT-GAN), a variant of generative adversarial nets minimizing a new metric measuring the distance between the generator distribution and the data distribution. This metric, which we call mini-batch energy distance, combines optimal transport in primal form with an energy distance defined in an adversarially learned feature space, resulting in a highly discriminative distance function with unbiased mini-batch gradients. Experimentally we show OT-GAN to be highly stable when trained with large mini-batches, and we present state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmark problems for image generation.
10	Different kinds of representation learning techniques on graph have shown significant effect in downstream machine learning tasks. Recently, in order to inductively learn representations for graph structures that is unobservable during training, a general framework with sampling and aggregating (GraphSAGE) was proposed by Hamilton and Ying and had been proved more efficient than transductive methods on fileds like transfer learning or evolving dataset. However, GraphSAGE is uncapable of selective neighbor sampling and lack of memory of known nodes that've been trained. To address these problems, we present an unsupervised method that samples neighborhood information attended by co-occurring structures and optimizes a trainable global bias as a representation expectation for each node in the given graph. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art inductive and unsupervised methods for representation learning on graphs.
10	Generative networks are promising models for specifying visual transformations. Unfortunately, certification of generative models is challenging as one needs to capture sufficient non-convexity so to produce precise bounds on the output. Existing verification methods either fail to scale to generative networks or do not capture enough non-convexity. In this work, we present a new verifier, called ApproxLine, that can certify non-trivial properties of generative networks. ApproxLine performs both deterministic and probabilistic abstract interpretation and captures infinite sets of outputs of generative networks. We show that ApproxLine can verify interesting interpolations in the network's latent space.
10	Conventional deep reinforcement learning typically determines an appropriate primitive action at each timestep, which requires enormous amount of time and effort for learning an effective policy, especially in large and complex environments. To deal with the issue fundamentally, we incorporate macro actions, defined as sequences of primitive actions, into the primitive action space to form an augmented action space. The problem lies in how to find an appropriate macro action to augment the primitive action space.  The agent using a proper augmented action space is able to jump to a farther state and thus speed up the exploration process as well as facilitate the learning procedure. In previous researches, macro actions are developed by mining the most frequently used action sequences or repeating previous actions. However, the most frequently used action sequences are extracted from a past policy, which may only reinforce the original behavior of that policy. On the other hand, repeating actions may limit the diversity of behaviors of the agent. Instead, we propose to construct macro actions by a genetic algorithm, which eliminates the dependency of the macro action derivation procedure from the past policies of the agent.  Our approach appends a macro action to the primitive action space once at a time and evaluates whether the augmented action space leads to promising performance or not.   We perform extensive experiments and show that the constructed macro actions are able to speed up the learning process for a variety of deep reinforcement learning methods. Our experimental results also demonstrate that the macro actions suggested by our approach are transferable among deep reinforcement learning methods and similar environments. We further provide a comprehensive set of ablation analysis to validate our methodology.
01	It is important to detect anomalous inputs when deploying machine learning systems. The use of larger and more complex inputs in deep learning magnifies the difficulty of distinguishing between anomalous and in-distribution examples. At the same time, diverse image and text data are available in enormous quantities. We propose leveraging these data to improve deep anomaly detection by training anomaly detectors against an auxiliary dataset of outliers, an approach we call Outlier Exposure (OE). This enables anomaly detectors to generalize and detect unseen anomalies. In extensive experiments on natural language processing and small- and large-scale vision tasks, we find that Outlier Exposure significantly improves detection performance. We also observe that cutting-edge generative models trained on CIFAR-10 may assign higher likelihoods to SVHN images than to CIFAR-10 images; we use OE to mitigate this issue. We also analyze the flexibility and robustness of Outlier Exposure, and identify characteristics of the auxiliary dataset that improve performance.
01	We introduce LiPopt, a polynomial optimization framework for computing increasingly tighter upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks. The underlying optimization problems boil down to either linear (LP) or semidefinite (SDP) programming. We show how to use the sparse connectivity of a network, to significantly reduce the complexity of computation. This is specially useful for convolutional as well as pruned neural networks. We conduct experiments on networks with random weights as well as networks trained on MNIST, showing that in the particular case of the $\ell_\infty$-Lipschitz constant, our approach yields superior estimates as compared to other baselines available in the literature.
10	Regularization is a big issue for training deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new information-theory-based regularization scheme named SHADE for SHAnnon DEcay. The originality of the approach is to define a prior based on conditional entropy, which explicitly decouples the learning of invariant representations in the regularizer and the learning of correlations between inputs and labels in the data fitting term. We explain why this quantity makes our model able to achieve invariance with respect to input variations. We empirically validate the efficiency of our approach to improve classification performances compared to standard regularization schemes on several standard architectures.
10	Detecting communities or the modular structure of real-life networks (e.g. a socialnetwork or a product purchase network) is an important task because the way anetwork functions is often determined by its communities.The traditional approaches to community detection involve modularity-based approaches,which generally speaking, construct partitions based on heuristics thatseek to maximize the ratio of the edges within the partitions to those betweenthem. Node embedding approaches, which represent each node in a graph as areal-valued vector, transform the problem of community detection in a graph tothat of clustering a set of vectors. Existing node embedding approaches are primarilybased on first initiating uniform random walks from each node to constructa context of a node and then seeks to make the vector representation ofthe node close to its context. However, standard node embedding approaches donot directly take into account the community structure of a network while constructingthe context around each node. To alleviate this, we explore two differentthreads of work. First, we investigate the use of biased random walks (specifically,maximum entropy based walks) to obtain more centrality preserving embeddingof nodes, which we hypothesize may lead to more effective clusters in the embeddedspace. Second, we propose a community structure aware node embeddingapproach where we incorporate modularity-based partitioning heuristics intothe objective function of node embedding. We demonstrate that our proposed approachfor community detection outperforms a number of modularity-based baselinesas well as K-means on a standard node-embedded vector space (specifically,node2vec) on a wide range of real-life networks of different sizes and densities.
10	The problem of building a coherent and non-monotonous conversational agent with proper discourse and coverage is still an area of open research. Current architectures only take care of semantic and contextual information for a given query and fail to completely account for syntactic and external knowledge which are crucial for generating responses in a chit-chat system. To overcome this problem, we propose an end to end multi-stream deep learning architecture which learns unified embeddings for query-response pairs by leveraging contextual information from memory networks and syntactic information by incorporating Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) over their dependency parse. A stream of this network also utilizes transfer learning by pre-training a bidirectional transformer to extract semantic representation for each input sentence and incorporates external knowledge through the neighbourhood of the entities from a Knowledge Base (KB). We benchmark these embeddings on next sentence prediction task and significantly improve upon the existing techniques. Furthermore, we use AMUSED to represent query and responses along with its context to develop a retrieval based conversational agent which has been validated by expert linguists to have comprehensive engagement with humans.
01	Off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms promise to be applicable in settings where only a fixed data-set (batch) of environment interactions is available and no new experience can be acquired. This property makes these algorithms appealing for real world problems such as robot control. In practice, however, standard off-policy algorithms fail in the batch setting for continuous control. In this paper, we propose a simple solution to this problem. It admits the use of data generated by arbitrary behavior policies and uses a learned prior -- the advantage-weighted behavior model (ABM) -- to bias the RL policy towards actions that have previously been executed and are likely to be successful on the new task. Our method can be seen as an extension of recent work on batch-RL that enables stable learning from conflicting data-sources. We find  improvements on competitive baselines in a variety of RL tasks -- including standard continuous control benchmarks and multi-task learning for simulated and real-world robots. 
01	Sample inefficiency is a long-lasting problem in reinforcement learning (RL). The state-of-the-art estimates the optimal action values while it usually involves an extensive search over the state-action space and unstable optimization. Towards the sample-efficient RL, we propose ranking policy gradient (RPG), a policy gradient method that learns the optimal rank of a set of discrete actions. To accelerate the learning of policy gradient methods, we establish the equivalence between maximizing the lower bound of return and imitating a near-optimal policy without accessing any oracles. These results lead to a general off-policy learning framework, which preserves the optimality, reduces variance, and improves the sample-efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments showing that when consolidating with the off-policy learning framework, RPG substantially reduces the sample complexity, comparing to the state-of-the-art.
10	It is clear that users should own and control their data and privacy. Utility providers are also becoming more interested in guaranteeing data privacy. Therefore, users and providers can and should collaborate in privacy protecting challenges, and this paper addresses this new paradigm. We propose a framework where the user controls what characteristics of the data they want to share (utility) and what they want to keep private (secret), without necessarily asking the utility provider to change its existing machine learning algorithms. We first analyze the space of privacy-preserving representations and derive natural information-theoretic bounds on the utility-privacy trade-off when disclosing a sanitized version of the data X. We present explicit learning architectures to learn privacy-preserving representations that approach this bound in a data-driven fashion. We describe important use-case scenarios where the utility providers are willing to collaborate with the sanitization process. We study space-preserving transformations where the utility provider can use the same algorithm on original and sanitized data, a critical and novel attribute to help service providers accommodate varying privacy requirements with a single set of utility algorithms. We illustrate this framework through  the implementation of three use cases; subject-within-subject, where we tackle the problem of having a face identity detector that works only on a consenting subset of users, an important application, for example, for mobile devices activated by face recognition; gender-and-subject, where we preserve facial verification while hiding the gender attribute for users who choose to do so; and emotion-and-gender, where we hide independent variables, as is the case of hiding gender while preserving emotion detection.
10	We propose a novel approach for preserving topological structures of the input space in latent representations of autoencoders. Using persistent homology, a technique from topological data analysis, we calculate topological signatures of both the input and latent space to derive a topological loss term. Under weak theoretical assumptions, we can construct this loss in a differentiable manner, such that the encoding learns to retain multi-scale connectivity information. We show that our approach is theoretically well-founded and that it exhibits favourable latent representations on a synthetic manifold as well as on real-world image data sets, while preserving low reconstruction errors.
10	Encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks  (CNN)  have been extensively used for various  inverse problems. However,  their prediction error  for unseen test data is difficult to estimate  a priori, since the neural networks are trained using only selected data and their architectures are largely considered blackboxes. This poses a fundamental  challenge in improving the performance of  neural networks. Recently, it was shown that Stein’s unbiased risk estimator (SURE) can be used as an unbiased estimator of the prediction error for denoising problems. However, the computation of the divergence term in SURE is difficult to implement in a neural network framework, and the condition to avoid trivial identity mapping is not well defined. In this paper, inspired by the finding that  an encoder-decoder CNN can be expressed as a piecewise linear representation, we provide a  close form expression of  the unbiased estimator for the prediction error. The close form representation leads to a novel boosting scheme to prevent a neural network from converging to an identity mapping so that it can enhance the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides consistent improvement in various inverse problems.
10	In adversarial attacks to machine-learning classifiers, small perturbations are added to input that is correctly classified. The perturbations yield adversarial examples, which are virtually indistinguishable from the unperturbed input, and yet are misclassified. In standard neural networks used for deep learning, attackers can craft adversarial examples from most input to cause a misclassification of their choice. We introduce a new type of network units, called RBFI units, whose non-linear structure makes them inherently resistant to adversarial attacks. On permutation-invariant MNIST, in absence of adversarial attacks, networks using RBFI units match the performance of networks using sigmoid units, and are slightly below the accuracy of networks with ReLU units. When subjected to adversarial attacks based on projected gradient descent or fast gradient-sign methods, networks with RBFI units retain accuracies above 75%, while ReLU or Sigmoid see their accuracies reduced to below 1%.Further, RBFI networks trained on regular input either exceed or closely match the accuracy of sigmoid and ReLU network trained with the help of adversarial examples.The non-linear structure of RBFI units makes them difficult to train using standard gradient descent. We show that RBFI networks of RBFI units can be efficiently trained to high accuracies using pseudogradients, computed using functions especially crafted to facilitate learning instead of their true derivatives.
10	We propose a framework for defining a Boolean algebra over the space of tasks. This allows us to formulate new tasks in terms of the negation, disjunction and conjunction of a set of base tasks. We then show that by learning goal-oriented value functions and restricting the transition dynamics of the tasks, an agent can solve these new tasks with no further learning. We prove that by composing these value functions in specific ways, we immediately recover the optimal policies for all tasks expressible under the Boolean algebra. We verify our approach in two domains, including a high-dimensional video game environment requiring function approximation, where an agent first learns a set of base skills, and then composes them to solve a super-exponential number of new tasks. 
01	A leading hypothesis for the surprising generalization of neural networks is that the dynamics of gradient descent bias the model towards simple solutions, by searching through the solution space in an incremental order of complexity. We formally define the notion of incremental learning dynamics and derive the conditions on depth and initialization for which this phenomenon arises in deep linear models. Our main theoretical contribution is a dynamical depth separation result, proving that while shallow models can exhibit incremental learning dynamics, they require the initialization to be exponentially small for these dynamics to present themselves. However, once the model becomes deeper, the dependence becomes polynomial and incremental learning can arise in more natural settings. We complement our theoretical findings by experimenting with deep matrix sensing, quadratic neural networks and with binary classification using diagonal and convolutional linear networks, showing all of these models exhibit incremental learning.
10	We consider the question of how to assess generative adversarial networks, in particular with respect to whether or not they generalise beyond memorising the training data. We propose a simple procedure for assessing generative adversarial network performance based on a principled consideration of what the actual goal of generalisation is. Our approach involves using a test set to estimate the Wasserstein distance between the generative distribution produced by our procedure, and the underlying data distribution. We use this procedure to assess the performance of several modern generative adversarial network architectures. We find that this procedure is sensitive to the choice of ground metric on the underlying data space, and suggest a choice of ground metric that substantially improves performance.  We finally suggest that attending to the ground metric used in Wasserstein generative adversarial network training may be fruitful, and outline a concrete pathway towards doing so.
10	The expressive power of end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems enables direct estimation of the character or word label sequence from  a sequence of acoustic features. Direct optimization of the whole system is advantageous because it not only eliminates the internal linkage necessary for hybrid systems,  but also extends the scope of potential application use cases by training the model for multiple objectives. Several multi-lingual ASR systems were recently proposed based on a monolithic neural network architecture without language-dependent modules, showing that modeling of multiple languages is well within the capabilities of an end-to-end framework. There has also been growing interest in multi-speaker speech recognition, which enables generation of multiple label sequences from single-channel mixed speech. In particular, a multi-speaker end-to-end ASR system that can directly model one-to-many mappings without additional auxiliary clues was recently proposed. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one end-to-end multi-lingual multi-speaker ASR system that integrates the capabilities of these two systems.  The proposed model is evaluated using mixtures of two speakers generated by using 10 languages, including mixed-language utterances. 
01	Learning-based approaches for semantic segmentation have two inherent challenges. First, acquiring pixel-wise labels is expensive and time-consuming. Second, realistic segmentation datasets are highly unbalanced: some categories are much more abundant than others, biasing the performance to the most represented ones. In this paper, we are interested in focusing human labelling effort on a small subset of a larger pool of data, minimizing this effort while maximizing performance of a segmentation model on a hold-out set. We present a new active learning strategy for semantic segmentation based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). An agent learns a policy to select a subset of small informative image regions -- opposed to entire images -- to be labeled, from a pool of unlabeled data. The region selection decision is made based on predictions and uncertainties of the segmentation model being trained. Our method proposes a new modification of the deep Q-network (DQN) formulation for active learning, adapting it to the large-scale nature of semantic segmentation problems. We test the proof of concept in CamVid and provide results in the large-scale dataset Cityscapes. On Cityscapes, our deep RL region-based DQN approach requires roughly 30% less additional labeled data than our most competitive baseline to reach the same performance. Moreover, we find that our method asks for more labels of under-represented categories compared to the baselines, improving their performance and helping to mitigate class imbalance.
10	We consider the task of program synthesis in the presence of a reward function over the output of programs, where the goal is to find programs with maximal rewards. We introduce a novel iterative optimization scheme, where we train an RNN on a dataset of K best programs from a priority queue of the generated programs so far. Then, we synthesize new programs and add them to the priority queue by sampling from the RNN. We benchmark our algorithm called priority queue training (PQT) against genetic algorithm and reinforcement learning baselines on a simple but expressive Turing complete programming language called BF. Our experimental results show that our deceptively simple PQT algorithm significantly outperforms the baselines. By adding a program length penalty to the reward function, we are able to synthesize short, human readable programs.
10	Learning distributed representations for nodes in graphs is a crucial primitive in network analysis with a wide spectrum of applications. Linear graph embedding methods learn such representations by optimizing the likelihood of both positive and negative edges while constraining the dimension of the embedding vectors. We argue that the generalization performance of these methods is not due to the dimensionality constraint as commonly believed, but rather the small norm of embedding vectors. Both theoretical and empirical evidence are provided to support this argument: (a) we prove that the generalization error of these methods can be bounded by limiting the norm of vectors, regardless of the embedding dimension; (b) we show that the generalization performance of linear graph embedding methods is correlated with the norm of embedding vectors, which is small due to the early stopping of SGD and the vanishing gradients. We performed extensive experiments to validate our analysis and showcased the importance of proper norm regularization in practice.
01	Self-supervised learning is showing great promise for monocular depth estimation, using geometry as the only source of supervision. Depth networks are indeed capable of learning representations that relate visual appearance to 3D properties by implicitly leveraging category-level patterns. In this work we investigate how to leverage more directly this semantic structure to guide geometric representation learning, while remaining in the self-supervised regime. Instead of using semantic labels and proxy losses in a multi-task approach, we propose a new architecture leveraging fixed pretrained semantic segmentation networks to guide self-supervised representation learning via pixel-adaptive convolutions. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training process to overcome a common semantic bias on dynamic objects via resampling. Our method improves upon the state of the art for self-supervised monocular depth prediction over all pixels, fine-grained details, and per semantic categories.
01	End-to-end neural models have made significant progress in question answering, however recent studies show that these models implicitly assume that the answer and evidence appear close together in a single document. In this work, we propose the Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC), a new question answering model that combines information from evidence across multiple documents. The CFC consists of a coarse-grain module that interprets documents with respect to the query then finds a relevant answer, and a fine-grain module which scores each candidate answer by comparing its occurrences across all of the documents with the query. We design these modules using hierarchies of coattention and self-attention, which learn to emphasize different parts of the input. On the Qangaroo WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task, the CFC obtains a new state-of-the-art result of 70.6% on the blind test set, outperforming the previous best by 3% accuracy despite not using pretrained contextual encoders.
10	This paper proposes a novel generative model called PUGAN, which progressively synthesizes high-quality audio in a raw waveform. PUGAN leverages on the recently proposed idea of progressive generation of higher-resolution images by stacking multiple encode-decoder architectures. To effectively apply it to raw audio generation, we propose two novel modules: (1) a neural upsampling layer and (2) a sinc convolutional layer. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art model called WaveGAN, which uses a single decoder architecture, our model generates audio signals and converts them in a higher resolution in a progressive manner, while using a significantly smaller number of parameters, e.g., 20x smaller for 44.1kHz output, than an existing technique called WaveGAN. Our experiments show that the audio signals can be generated in real-time with the comparable quality to that of WaveGAN with respect to the inception scores and the human evaluation.
10	Evolution strategies or zeroth-order optimization algorithms have become popular in some areas of optimization and machine learning where only the oracle of function value evaluations is available. The central idea in the design of the algorithms is by querying function values of some perturbed points in the neighborhood of the current update and constructing a pseudo-gradient using the function values. In recent years, there is a growing interest in developing new ways of perturbation. Though the new perturbation methods are well motivating, most of them are criticized for lack of convergence guarantees even when the underlying function is convex. Perhaps the only methods that enjoy convergence guarantees are the ones that sample the perturbed points uniformly from a unit sphere or from a multivariate Gaussian distribution with an isotropic covariance. In this work, we tackle the non-convergence issue and propose sampling perturbed points from a mixture of distributions. Experiments show that our proposed method can identify the best perturbation scheme for the convergence and might also help to leverage the complementariness of different perturbation schemes.
10	Latent variable models have been widely applied for the analysis and visualization of large datasets. In the case of sequential data, closed-form inference is possible when the transition and observation functions are linear. However, approximate inference techniques are usually necessary when dealing with nonlinear evolution and observations. Here, we propose a novel variational inference framework for the explicit modeling of time series, Variational Inference for Nonlinear Dynamics (VIND), that is able to uncover nonlinear observation and latent dynamics from sequential data. The framework includes a structured approximate posterior, and an algorithm that relies on the fixed-point iteration method to find the best estimate for latent trajectories. We apply the method to several datasets and show that it is able to accurately infer the underlying dynamics of these systems, in some cases substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
10	A major drawback of backpropagation through time (BPTT) is the difficulty of learning long-term dependencies, coming from having to propagate credit information backwards through every single step of the forward computation. This makes BPTT both computationally impractical and biologically implausible. For this reason, full backpropagation through time is rarely used on long sequences, and truncated backpropagation through time is used as a heuristic.  However, this usually leads to biased estimates of the gradient in which longer term dependencies are ignored.  Addressing this issue, we propose an alternative algorithm, Sparse Attentive Backtracking, which might also be related to principles used by brains to learn long-term dependencies. Sparse Attentive Backtracking learns an attention mechanism over the hidden states of the past and selectively backpropagates through paths with high attention weights.  This allows the model to learn long term dependencies while only backtracking for a small number of time steps, not just from the recent past but also from attended relevant past states.   
10	"We investigate in this paper the architecture of deep convolutional networks. Building on existing state of the art models, we propose a reconfiguration of the model parameters into several parallel branches at the global network level, with each branch being a standalone CNN. We show that this arrangement is an efficient way to significantly reduce the number of parameters while at the same time improving the performance. The use of branches brings an additional form of regularization. In addition to splitting the parameters into parallel branches, we propose a tighter coupling of these branches by averaging their log-probabilities. The tighter coupling favours the learning of better representations, even at the level of the individual branches, as compared to when each branch is trained independently. We refer to this branched architecture as ""coupled ensembles"". The approach is very generic and can be applied with almost any neural network architecture. With coupled ensembles of DenseNet-BC and parameter budget of 25M, we obtain error rates of 2.92%, 15.68% and 1.50% respectively on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN tasks. For the same parameter budget, DenseNet-BC has an error rate of 3.46%, 17.18%, and 1.8% respectively.  With ensembles of coupled ensembles, of DenseNet-BC networks, with 50M total parameters, we obtain error rates of 2.72%, 15.13% and 1.42% respectively on these tasks."
10	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become the gold standard when it comes to learning generative models for high-dimensional distributions. Since their advent, numerous variations of GANs have been introduced in the literature, primarily focusing on utilization of novel loss functions, optimization/regularization strategies and network architectures. In this paper, we turn our attention to the generator and investigate the use of high-order polynomials as an alternative class of universal function approximators. Concretely, we propose PolyGAN, where we model the data generator by means of a high-order polynomial whose unknown parameters are naturally represented by high-order tensors. We introduce two tensor decompositions that significantly reduce the number of parameters and show how they can be efficiently implemented by hierarchical neural networks that only employ linear/convolutional blocks. We exhibit for the first time that by using our approach a GAN generator can approximate the data distribution without using any activation functions. Thorough experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real data (images and 3D point clouds) demonstrates the merits of PolyGAN against the state of the art.
10	Adversarial examples are a pervasive phenomenon of machine learning models where seemingly imperceptible perturbations to the input lead to misclassifications for otherwise statistically accurate models. We propose a geometric framework, drawing on tools from the manifold reconstruction literature, to analyze the high-dimensional geometry of adversarial examples. In particular, we highlight the importance of codimension: for low-dimensional data manifolds embedded in high-dimensional space there are many directions off the manifold in which to construct adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are a natural consequence of learning a decision boundary that classifies the low-dimensional data manifold well, but classifies points near the manifold incorrectly. Using our geometric framework we prove (1) a tradeoff between robustness under different norms, (2) that adversarial training in balls around the data is sample inefficient, and (3) sufficient sampling conditions under which nearest neighbor classifiers and ball-based adversarial training are robust.
01	Structured prediction energy networks (SPENs; Belanger & McCallum 2016) use neural network architectures to define energy functions that can capture arbitrary dependencies among parts of structured outputs. Prior work used gradient descent for inference, relaxing the structured output to a set of continuous variables and then optimizing the energy with respect to them. We replace this use of gradient descent with a neural network trained to approximate structured argmax inference. This“inference network” outputs continuous values that we treat as the output structure. We develop large-margin training criteria for joint training of the structured energy function and inference network. On multi-label classification we report speed-upsof 10-60x compared to (Belanger et al., 2017) while also improving accuracy. For sequence labeling with simple structured energies, our approach performs comparably to exact inference while being much faster at test time. We then demonstrate improved accuracy by augmenting the energy with a “label language model” that scores entire output label sequences, showing it can improve handling of long-distance dependencies in part-of-speech tagging. Finally, we show how inference networks can replace dynamic programming for test-time inference in conditional random fields, suggestive for their general use for fast inference in structured settings.
10	Deep learning has become the state of the art approach in many machine learning problems such as classification. It has recently been shown that deep learning is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Taking the camera systems of self-driving cars as an example, small adversarial perturbations can cause the system to  make errors in important tasks, such as classifying traffic signs or detecting pedestrians. Hence, in order to use deep learning without safety concerns a proper defense strategy is required. We propose to use ensemble methods as a defense strategy against adversarial perturbations. We find that an attack leading one model to misclassify does not imply the same for other networks performing the same task. This makes ensemble methods an attractive defense strategy against adversarial attacks. We empirically show for the MNIST and the CIFAR-10 data sets that ensemble methods not only improve the accuracy of neural networks on test data but also increase their robustness against adversarial perturbations.
10	Adversarial training has been successfully applied to build robust models at a certain cost. While the robustness of a model increases, the standard classification accuracy declines. This phenomenon is suggested to be an inherent trade-off. We propose a model that employs feature prioritization by a nonlinear attention module and $L_2$ feature regularization to improve the adversarial robustness and the standard accuracy relative to adversarial training. The attention module encourages the model to rely heavily on robust features by assigning larger weights to them while suppressing non-robust features. The regularizer encourages the model to extracts similar features for the natural and adversarial images, effectively ignoring the added perturbation. In addition to evaluating the robustness of our model, we provide justification for the attention module and propose a novel experimental strategy that quantitatively demonstrates that our model is almost ideally aligned with salient data characteristics. Additional experimental results illustrate the power of our model relative to the state of the art methods.
01	Visual Question Answering (VQA) models have struggled with counting objects in natural images so far. We identify a fundamental problem due to soft attention in these models as a cause. To circumvent this problem, we propose a neural network component that allows robust counting from object proposals. Experiments on a toy task show the effectiveness of this component and we obtain state-of-the-art accuracy on the number category of the VQA v2 dataset without negatively affecting other categories, even outperforming ensemble models with our single model. On a difficult balanced pair metric, the component gives a substantial improvement in counting over a strong baseline by 6.6%.
10	Learning disentangled representations of  data is one of the central themes in unsupervised learning in general and generative modelling in particular.  In this work,  we tackle a slightly more intricate scenario where the observations are generated from a conditional distribution of some known control variate and some latent noise variate.  To this end, we present a hierarchical model and a training method (CZ-GEM) that leverages some of the recent developments in likelihood-based and likelihood-free generative models.  We show that by formulation, CZ-GEM introduces the right inductive biases that ensure the disentanglement of the control from the noise variables, while also keeping the components of the control variate disentangled. This is achieved without compromising on the quality of the generated samples. Our approach is simple, general, and can be applied both in supervised and unsupervised settings.
10	In multi-participant postings, as in online chat conversations, several conversations or topic threads may take place concurrently. This leads to difficulties for readers reviewing the postings in not only following discussions but also in quickly identifying their essence. A two-step process, disentanglement of interleaved posts followed by summarization of each thread, addresses the issue, but disentanglement errors are propagated to the summarization step, degrading the overall performance. To address this, we propose an end-to-end trainable encoder-decoder network for summarizing interleaved posts. The interleaved posts are encoded hierarchically, i.e., word-to-word (words in a post) followed by post-to-post (posts in a channel). The decoder also generates summaries hierarchically, thread-to-thread (generate thread representations) followed by word-to-word (i.e., generate summary words). Additionally, we propose a hierarchical attention mechanism for interleaved text. Overall, our end-to-end trainable hierarchical framework enhances performance over a sequence to sequence framework by 8-10% on multiple synthetic interleaved texts datasets.
01	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) continue to show  outstanding performance in sequence modeling tasks. However, training RNNs on long sequences often face challenges like slow inference, vanishing gradients and difficulty in capturing long term dependencies. In backpropagation through time settings, these issues are tightly coupled with the large, sequential computational graph resulting from unfolding the RNN in time. We introduce the Skip RNN model which extends existing RNN models by learning to skip state updates and shortens the effective size of the computational graph. This model can also be encouraged to perform fewer state updates through a budget constraint. We evaluate the proposed model on various tasks and show how it can reduce the number of required RNN updates while preserving, and sometimes even improving, the performance of the baseline RNN models. Source code is publicly available at https://imatge-upc.github.io/skiprnn-2017-telecombcn/.
10	Question generation is an important task for improving our ability to process natural language data, with additional challenges over other sequence transformation tasks. Recent approaches use modifications to a Seq2Seq architecture inspired by advances in machine translation, but unlike translation the input and output vocabularies overlap significantly, and there are many different valid questions for each input. Approaches using copy mechanisms and reinforcement learning have shown promising results, but there are ambiguities in the exact implementation that have not yet been investigated. We show that by removing inductive bias from the model and allowing the choice of generation path to become latent, we achieve substantial improvements over implementations biased with both naive and smart heuristics. We perform a human evaluation to confirm these findings. We show that although policy gradient methods may be used to decouple training from the ground truth and optimise directly for quality metrics that have previously been assumed to be good choices, these objectives are poorly aligned with human judgement and the model simply learns to exploit the weaknesses of the reward source. Finally, we show that an adversarial objective learned directly from the ground truth data is not able to generate a useful training signal.
10	The source code of a program not only serves as a formal description of an executable task, but it also serves to communicate developer intent in a human-readable form. To facilitate this, developers use meaningful identifier names and natural-language documentation. This makes it possible to successfully apply sequence-modeling approaches, shown to be effective in natural-language processing, to source code. A major advancement in natural-language understanding has been the use of pre-trained token embeddings; BERT and other works have further shown that pre-trained contextual embeddings can be extremely powerful and can be finetuned effectively for a variety of downstream supervised tasks. Inspired by these developments, we present the first attempt to replicate this success on source code. We curate a massive corpus of Python programs from GitHub to pre-train a BERT model, which we call Code Understanding BERT (CuBERT). We also pre-train Word2Vec embeddings on the same dataset. We create a benchmark of five classification tasks and compare finetuned CuBERT against sequence models trained with and without the Word2Vec embeddings. Our results show that CuBERT outperforms the baseline methods by a margin of 2.9-22%. We also show its superiority when finetuned with smaller datasets, and over fewer epochs.
10	The Actor-Critic framework of multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) is gathering more attention nowadays. Centralized training with decentralized execution allows the policies to use extra information to ease the training while enhancing overall performance. In such a framework, the quality of critic profoundly impacts the final average rewards. Thus we present a method, called Scholastic-Actor-Critic(SMAC), that involves a more powerful critic to maintain efficiency in ample knowledge acquisition. The headmaster critic is designed to group agents with proper size and proper timing, while other critics update simultaneously at the decision time. The learning rule includes additional terms account for the impact of other agents within a group. Our method receives higher payouts compared to other state-of-the-art methods and is robust against the explosion of dimension during training. We apply our method to the Coin Game,  the Cooperative Treasure Collection(CTC) and a dynamic battle game, MAgent. Experiment results are all satisfying.
01	We study the phenomenon that some modules of deep neural networks (DNNs) are more critical than others. Meaning that rewinding their parameter values back to initialization, while keeping other modules fixed at the trained parameters, results in a large drop in the network's performance. Our analysis reveals interesting properties of the loss landscape which leads us to propose a complexity measure, called module criticality, based on the shape of the valleys that connect the initial and final values of the module parameters. We formulate how generalization relates to the module criticality, and show that this measure is able to explain the superior generalization performance of some architectures over others, whereas, earlier measures fail to do so.
10	Several state of the art convolutional networks rely on inter-connecting different layers to ease the flow of information and gradient between their input and output layers. These techniques have enabled practitioners to successfully train deep convolutional networks with hundreds of layers. Particularly, a novel way of interconnecting layers was introduced as the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) and has achieved state of the art performance on relevant image recognition tasks. Despite their notable empirical success, their theoretical understanding is still limited. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing the effect of layer interconnection on the overall expressive power of a convolutional network. In particular, the  connections used in DenseNet are compared with other types of inter-layer connectivity. We carry out a tensor analysis on the expressive power inter-connections on convolutional arithmetic circuits (ConvACs) and relate our results to standard convolutional networks. The analysis leads to performance bounds and practical guidelines for design of ConvACs. The generalization of these results are discussed for other kinds of convolutional networks via generalized tensor decompositions.
10	Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving problems by exploring and learning from mistakes. However, in the context of autonomous vehicle (AV) control, requiring an agent to make mistakes, or even allowing mistakes, can be quite dangerous and costly in the real world. For this reason, AV RL is generally only viable in simulation. Because these simulations have imperfect representations, particularly with respect to graphics, physics, and human interaction, we find motivation for a framework similar to RL, suitable to the real world. To this end, we formulate a learning framework that learns from restricted exploration by having a human demonstrator do the exploration. Existing work on learning from demonstration typically either assumes the collected data is performed by an optimal expert, or requires potentially dangerous exploration to find the optimal policy. We propose an alternative framework that learns continuous control from only safe behavior. One of our key insights is that the problem becomes tractable if the feedback score that rates the demonstration applies to the atomic action, as opposed to the entire sequence of actions. We use human experts to collect driving data as well as to label the driving data through a framework we call ``Backseat Driver'', giving us state-action pairs matched with scalar values representing the score for the action. We call the more general learning framework ReNeg, since it learns a regression from states to actions given negative as well as positive examples. We empirically validate several models in the ReNeg framework, testing on lane-following with limited data. We find that the best solution in this context outperforms behavioral cloning has strong connections to stochastic policy gradient approaches.
01	"We show that a variety of modern deep learning tasks exhibit a ""double-descent"" phenomenon where, as we increase model size, performance first gets worse and then gets  better.  Moreover, we show that double descent occurs not just as a function of model size, but also as a function of the number of training epochs. We unify the above phenomena by defining a new complexity measure we call the effective model complexity, and conjecture a generalized double descent with respect to this measure. Furthermore, our notion of model complexity allows us to identify certain regimes where increasing (even quadrupling) the number of train samples actually hurts test performance."
01	Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) have recently emerged as a clinically viable optionto restore voluntary movements after paralysis. These devices are based on theability to extract information about movement intent from neural signals recordedusing multi-electrode arrays chronically implanted in the motor cortices of thebrain. However, the inherent loss and turnover of recorded neurons requires repeatedrecalibrations of the interface, which can potentially alter the day-to-dayuser experience. The resulting need for continued user adaptation interferes withthe natural, subconscious use of the BMI. Here, we introduce a new computationalapproach that decodes movement intent from a low-dimensional latent representationof the neural data. We implement various domain adaptation methodsto stabilize the interface over significantly long times. This includes CanonicalCorrelation Analysis used to align the latent variables across days; this methodrequires prior point-to-point correspondence of the time series across domains.Alternatively, we match the empirical probability distributions of the latent variablesacross days through the minimization of their Kullback-Leibler divergence.These two methods provide a significant and comparable improvement in the performanceof the interface. However, implementation of an Adversarial DomainAdaptation Network trained to match the empirical probability distribution of theresiduals of the reconstructed neural signals outperforms the two methods basedon latent variables, while requiring remarkably few data points to solve the domainadaptation problem.
10	Recent works find that DNNs are  vulnerable to adversarial examples, whose changes from the benign ones are imperceptible and yet lead DNNs to make wrong predictions. One can find various adversarial examples for the same input to a DNN using different attack methods. In other words, there is a population of adversarial examples, instead of only one, for any input to a DNN. By explicitly modeling this adversarial population with a Gaussian distribution, we propose a new black-box attack called NATTACK. The adversarial attack is hence formalized as an optimization problem, which searches the mean of the Gaussian under the guidance of increasing the target DNN's prediction error. NATTACK achieves 100%  attack success rate  on six out of eleven recently published defense methods (and greater than 90% for four), all using the same algorithm. Such results are on par with or better than  powerful state-of-the-art white-box attacks. While the white-box attacks are often model-specific or defense-specific, the proposed black-box NATTACK is universally applicable to different defenses. 
10	For the challenging semantic image segmentation task the best performing modelshave traditionally combined the structured modelling capabilities of ConditionalRandom Fields (CRFs) with the feature extraction power of CNNs. In more recentworks however, CRF post-processing has fallen out of favour. We argue that thisis mainly due to the slow training and inference speeds of CRFs, as well as thedifficulty of learning the internal CRF parameters. To overcome both issues wepropose to add the assumption of conditional independence to the framework offully-connected CRFs. This allows us to reformulate the inference in terms ofconvolutions, which can be implemented highly efficiently on GPUs.Doing sospeeds up inference and training by two orders of magnitude. All parameters ofthe convolutional CRFs can easily be optimized using backpropagation. Towardsthe goal of facilitating further CRF research we have made our implementationspublicly available.
01	Detecting objects such as cars and pedestrians in 3D plays an indispensable role in autonomous driving. Existing approaches largely rely on expensive LiDAR sensors for accurate depth information. While recently pseudo-LiDAR has been introduced as a promising alternative, at a much lower cost based solely on stereo images, there is still a notable performance gap. In this paper we provide substantial advances to the pseudo-LiDAR framework through improvements in stereo depth estimation. Concretely, we adapt the stereo network architecture and loss function to be more aligned with accurate depth estimation of faraway objects --- currently the primary weakness of pseudo-LiDAR. Further, we explore the idea to leverage cheaper but extremely sparse LiDAR sensors, which alone provide insufficient information for 3D detection, to de-bias our depth estimation. We propose a depth-propagation algorithm, guided by the initial depth estimates, to diffuse these few exact measurements across the entire depth map. We show on the KITTI object detection benchmark that our combined approach yields substantial improvements in depth estimation and stereo-based 3D object detection --- outperforming the previous state-of-the-art detection accuracy for faraway objects by 40%. Our code is available at https://github.com/mileyan/Pseudo_Lidar_V2.
01	Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to over-fit a dataset when being trained with noisy labels for a long enough time. To overcome this problem, we present a simple and effective method self-ensemble label filtering (SELF) to progressively filter out the wrong labels during training. Our method improves the task performance by gradually allowing supervision only from the potentially non-noisy (clean) labels and stops learning on the filtered noisy labels. For the filtering, we form running averages of predictions over the entire training dataset using the network output at different training epochs. We show that these ensemble estimates yield more accurate identification of inconsistent predictions throughout training than the single estimates of the network at the most recent training epoch. While filtered samples are removed entirely from the supervised training loss, we dynamically leverage them via semi-supervised learning in the unsupervised loss. We demonstrate the positive effect of such an approach on various image classification tasks under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise and at different noise ratios. It substantially outperforms all previous works on noise-aware learning across different datasets and can be applied to a broad set of network architectures.
01	Formal verification techniques that compute provable guarantees on properties of machine learning models, like robustness to norm-bounded adversarial perturbations, have yielded impressive results. Although most techniques developed so far require knowledge of the architecture of the machine learning model and remain hard to scale to complex prediction pipelines, the method of randomized smoothing has been shown to overcome many of these obstacles. By requiring only black-box access to the underlying model, randomized smoothing scales to large architectures and is agnostic to the internals of the network. However, past work on randomized smoothing has focused on restricted classes of smoothing measures or perturbations (like Gaussian or discrete) and has only been able to prove robustness with respect to simple norm bounds. In this paper we introduce a general framework for proving robustness properties of smoothed machine learning models in the black-box setting. Specifically, we extend randomized smoothing procedures to handle arbitrary smoothing measures and prove robustness of the smoothed classifier by using f-divergences. Our methodology improves upon the state of the art in terms of computation time or certified robustness on several image classification tasks and an audio classification task, with respect to several classes of adversarial perturbations. 
10	The paper, interested in unsupervised feature selection, aims to retain the features best accounting for the local patterns in the data. The proposed approach, called Locally Linear Unsupervised Feature Selection, relies on a dimensionality reduction method to characterize such patterns; each feature is thereafter assessed according to its compliance w.r.t. the local patterns, taking inspiration from Locally Linear Embedding (Roweis and Saul, 2000). The experimental validation of the approach on the scikit-feature benchmark suite demonstrates its effectiveness compared to the state of the art.
10	This paper presents the Variation Network (VarNet), a  generative model providing means to manipulate the high-level attributes of a given input. The originality of our approach is that VarNet is not only capable of handling pre-defined attributes but can also learn the relevant attributes of the dataset by itself.  These two settings can be easily combined  which makes VarNet applicable for a wide variety of tasks. Further, VarNet has a sound probabilistic interpretation which grants us with  a novel way to navigate in the latent spaces as well as means to control how the  attributes are learned. We demonstrate  experimentally that this model is capable of performing interesting input manipulation  and that the learned attributes are relevant and interpretable.
01	While recent continual learning methods largely alleviate the catastrophic problem on toy-sized datasets, there are issues that remain to be tackled in order to apply them to real-world problem domains. First, a continual learning model should effectively handle catastrophic forgetting and be efficient to train even with a large number of tasks. Secondly, it needs to tackle the problem of order-sensitivity, where the performance of the tasks largely varies based on the order of the task arrival sequence, as it may cause serious problems where fairness plays a critical role (e.g. medical diagnosis). To tackle these practical challenges, we propose a novel continual learning method that is scalable as well as order-robust, which instead of learning a completely shared set of weights, represents the parameters  for each task as a sum of task-shared and sparse task-adaptive parameters. With our Additive Parameter Decomposition (APD), the task-adaptive parameters for earlier tasks remain mostly unaffected, where we update them only to reflect the changes made to the task-shared parameters. This decomposition of parameters effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting and order-sensitivity, while being computation- and memory-efficient. Further, we can achieve even better scalability with APD using hierarchical knowledge consolidation, which clusters the task-adaptive parameters to obtain hierarchically shared parameters. We validate our network with APD, APD-Net, on multiple benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art continual learning methods, which it largely outperforms in accuracy, scalability, and order-robustness.
10	Now GANs can generate more and more realistic face images that can easily fool human beings.  In contrast, a common convolutional neural network(CNN), e.g. ResNet-18, can achieve more than 99.9% accuracy in discerning fake/real faces if training and testing faces are from the same source. In this paper, we performed both human studies and CNN experiments, which led us to two important findings. One finding is that the textures of fake faces are substantially different from real ones. CNNs can capture local image texture information for recognizing fake/real face, while such cues are easily overlooked by humans. The other finding is that global image texture information is more robust to image editing and generalizable to fake faces from different GANs and datasets. Based on the above findings, we propose  a  novel  architecture  coined  as  Gram-Net,  which  incorporates  “Gram Block” in multiple semantic levels to extract global image texture representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our Gram-Net performs better than existing approaches for fake face detection.  Especially, our Gram-Net is more robust to image editing, e.g.  downsampling, JPEG compression, blur, and noise.  More importantly, our Gram-Net generalizes significantly better in detecting fake faces from GAN models not seen in the training phase.
10	This paper addresses the data-driven identification of latent representations of partially-observed dynamical systems, i.e. dynamical systems whose some components are never observed, with an emphasis on forecasting applications and long-term asymptotic patterns. Whereas state-of-the-art data-driven approaches rely on delay embeddings and linear decompositions of the underlying operators, we introduce a framework based on the data-driven identification of an augmented state-space model using a neural-network-based representation. For a given training dataset, it amounts to jointly reconstructing the latent states and learning an ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) representation in this space. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the relevance of the proposed framework w.r.t. state-of-the-art approaches in terms of short-term forecasting errors and long-term behaviour. We further discuss how the proposed framework relates to Koopman operator theory and Takens' embedding theorem.
10	"Discrete choice models with unobserved heterogeneity are commonly used Econometric models for dynamic Economic behavior which have been adopted in practice to predict behavior of individuals and firms from schooling and job choices to strategic decisions in market competition. These models  feature optimizing agents who choose among a finite set of options in a sequence of periods and receive choice-specific payoffs that depend on both variables that are observed by the agent and recorded in the data and variables that are only observed by the agent but not recorded in the data. Existing work in Econometrics assumes that optimizing agents are fully rational and requires finding a functional fixed point to find the optimal policy. We show that in an important class of discrete choice models the value function is globally concave in the policy. That means that simple algorithms that do not require fixed point computation, such as the policy gradient algorithm, globally converge to the optimal policy. This finding can both be used to relax behavioral assumption regarding the optimizing agents and to facilitate Econometric analysis of dynamic behavior. In particular, we demonstrate significant computational advantages in using a simple implementation policy gradient algorithm over existing ""nested fixed point"" algorithms used in Econometrics."
01	  Learning a policy using only observational data is challenging because the distribution of states it induces at execution time may differ from the distribution observed during training. In this work, we propose to train a policy while explicitly penalizing the mismatch between these two distributions over a fixed time horizon. We do this by using a learned model of the environment dynamics which is unrolled for multiple time steps, and training a policy network to minimize a differentiable cost over this rolled-out trajectory. This cost contains two terms: a policy cost which represents the objective the policy seeks to optimize, and an uncertainty cost which represents its divergence from the states it is trained on. We propose to measure this second cost by using the uncertainty of the dynamics model about its own predictions, using recent ideas from uncertainty estimation for deep networks. We evaluate our approach using a large-scale observational dataset of driving behavior recorded from traffic cameras, and show that we are able to learn effective driving policies from purely observational data, with no environment interaction. 
01	A structured understanding of our world in terms of objects, relations, and hierarchies is an important component of human cognition. Learning such a structured world model from raw sensory data remains a challenge. As a step towards this goal, we introduce Contrastively-trained Structured World Models (C-SWMs). C-SWMs utilize a contrastive approach for representation learning in environments with compositional structure. We structure each state embedding as a set of object representations and their relations, modeled by a graph neural network. This allows objects to be discovered from raw pixel observations without direct supervision as part of the learning process. We evaluate C-SWMs on compositional environments involving multiple interacting objects that can be manipulated independently by an agent, simple Atari games, and a multi-object physics simulation. Our experiments demonstrate that C-SWMs can overcome limitations of models based on pixel reconstruction and outperform typical representatives of this model class in highly structured environments, while learning interpretable object-based representations.
01	We present a novel method of compression of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by weight sharing through a new representation of convolutional filters. The proposed method reduces the number of parameters of each convolutional layer by learning a $1$D vector termed Filter Summary (FS). The convolutional filters are located in FS as overlapping $1$D segments, and nearby filters in FS share weights in their overlapping regions in a natural way. The resultant neural network based on such weight sharing scheme, termed Filter Summary CNNs or FSNet, has a FS in each convolution layer instead of a set of independent filters in the conventional convolution layer. FSNet has the same architecture as that of the baseline CNN to be compressed, and each convolution layer of FSNet has the same number of filters from FS as that of the basline CNN in the forward process. With compelling computational acceleration ratio, the parameter space of FSNet is much smaller than that of the baseline CNN. In addition, FSNet is quantization friendly. FSNet with weight quantization leads to even higher compression ratio without noticeable performance loss. We further propose Differentiable FSNet where the way filters share weights is learned in a differentiable and end-to-end manner. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FSNet in compression of CNNs for computer vision tasks including image classification and object detection, and the effectiveness of DFSNet is evidenced by the task of Neural Architecture Search.
01	"Recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and self-attention networks (SAN) are commonly used to produce context-aware representations. RNN can capture long-range dependency but is hard to parallelize and not time-efficient. CNN focuses on local dependency but does not perform well on some tasks. SAN can model both such dependencies via highly parallelizable computation, but memory requirement grows rapidly in line with sequence length. In this paper, we propose a model, called ""bi-directional block self-attention network (Bi-BloSAN)"", for RNN/CNN-free sequence encoding. It requires as little memory as RNN but with all the merits of SAN. Bi-BloSAN splits the entire sequence into blocks, and applies an intra-block SAN to each block for modeling local context, then applies an inter-block SAN to the outputs for all blocks to capture long-range dependency. Thus, each SAN only needs to process a short sequence, and only a small amount of memory is required. Additionally, we use feature-level attention to handle the variation of contexts around the same word, and use forward/backward masks to encode temporal order information. On nine benchmark datasets for different NLP tasks, Bi-BloSAN achieves or improves upon state-of-the-art accuracy, and shows better efficiency-memory trade-off than existing RNN/CNN/SAN. "
01	While many approaches to make neural networks more fathomable have been proposed, they are restricted to interrogating the network with input data. Measures for characterizing and monitoring structural properties, however, have not been developed. In this work, we propose neural persistence, a complexity measure for neural network architectures based on topological data analysis on weighted stratified graphs. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we show that neural persistence reflects best practices developed in the deep learning community such as dropout and batch normalization. Moreover, we derive a neural persistence-based stopping criterion that shortens the training process while achieving comparable accuracies as early stopping based on validation loss.
01	In this work, we face the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation with a novel deep learning approach which leverages our finding that entropy minimization is induced by the optimal alignment of second order statistics between source and target domains. We formally demonstrate this hypothesis and, aiming at achieving an optimal alignment in practical cases, we adopt a more principled strategy which, differently from the current Euclidean approaches, deploys alignment along geodesics. Our pipeline can be implemented by adding to the standard classification loss (on the labeled source domain), a source-to-target regularizer that is weighted in an unsupervised and data-driven fashion. We provide extensive experiments to assess the superiority of our framework on standard domain and modality adaptation benchmarks.
10	In many learning situations, resources at inference time are significantly more constrained than resources at training time. This paper studies a general paradigm, called Differentiable ARchitecture Compression (DARC), that combines model compression and architecture search to learn models that are resource-efficient at inference time. Given a resource-intensive base architecture, DARC utilizes the training data to learn which sub-components can be replaced by cheaper alternatives. The high-level technique can be applied to any neural architecture, and we report experiments on state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for image classification. For a WideResNet with 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10, we improve single-sample inference speed by 2.28X and memory footprint by 5.64X, with no accuracy loss. For a ResNet with 79.15% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, we improve batch inference speed by 1.29X and memory footprint by 3.57X with 1% accuracy loss. We also give theoretical Rademacher complexity bounds in simplified cases, showing how DARC avoids over-fitting despite over-parameterization.
10	Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has gained tremendous success in computer vision tasks with its outstanding ability to capture the local latent features. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in extending CNNs to the general spatial domain. Although various types of graph convolution and geometric convolution methods have been proposed, their connections to traditional 2D-convolution are not well-understood. In this paper, we show that depthwise separable convolution is a path to unify the two kinds of convolution methods in one mathematical view, based on which we derive a novel Depthwise Separable Graph Convolution that subsumes existing graph convolution methods as special cases of our formulation. Experiments show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms other graph convolution and geometric convolution baselines on benchmark datasets in multiple domains.
10	Existing unsupervised video-to-video translation methods fail to produce translated videos which are frame-wise realistic, semantic information preserving and video-level consistent. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised video-to-video translation model. Our model decomposes the style and the content, uses specialized encoder-decoder structure and propagates the inter-frame information through bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) units. The style-content decomposition mechanism enables us to achieve long-term style-consistent video translation results as well as provides us with a good interface for modality flexible translation. In addition, by changing the input frames and style codes incorporated in our translation, we propose a video interpolation loss, which captures temporal information within the sequence to train our building blocks in a self-supervised manner. Our model can produce photo-realistic, spatio-temporal consistent translated videos in a multimodal way. Subjective and objective experimental results validate the superiority of our model over the existing methods.
01	"Expressive efficiency refers to the relation between two architectures A and B, whereby any function realized by B could be replicated by A, but there exists functions realized by A, which cannot be replicated by B unless its size grows significantly larger. For example, it is known that deep networks are exponentially efficient with respect to shallow networks, in the sense that a shallow network must grow exponentially large in order to approximate the functions represented by a deep network of polynomial size. In this work, we extend the study of expressive efficiency to the attribute of network connectivity and in particular to the effect of ""overlaps"" in the convolutional process, i.e., when the stride of the convolution is smaller than its filter size (receptive field).To theoretically analyze this aspect of network's design, we focus on a well-established surrogate for ConvNets called Convolutional Arithmetic Circuits (ConvACs), and then demonstrate empirically that our results hold for standard ConvNets as well. Specifically, our analysis shows that having overlapping local receptive fields, and more broadly denser connectivity, results in an exponential increase in the expressive capacity of neural networks. Moreover, while denser connectivity can increase the expressive capacity, we show that the most common types of modern architectures already exhibit exponential increase in expressivity, without relying on fully-connected layers."
10	Text summarization aims to extract essential information from a piece of text and transform it into a concise version. Existing unsupervised abstractive summarization models use recurrent neural networks framework and ignore abundant unlabeled corpora resources. In order to address these issues, we propose TED, a transformer-based unsupervised summarization system with dataset-agnostic pretraining. We first leverage the lead bias in news articles to pretrain the model on large-scale corpora. Then, we finetune TED on target domains through theme modeling and a denoising autoencoder to enhance the quality of summaries. Notably, TED outperforms all unsupervised abstractive baselines on NYT, CNN/DM and English Gigaword datasets with various document styles. Further analysis shows that the summaries generated by TED are abstractive and containing even higher proportions of novel tokens than those from supervised models.
01	Adversarial attacks on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have gained significant attention and there have been active research efforts on defense mechanisms. Stochastic input transformation methods have been proposed, where the idea is to recover the image from adversarial attack by random transformation, and to take the majority vote as consensus among the random samples. However, the transformation improves the accuracy on adversarial images at the expense of the accuracy on clean images. While it is intuitive that the accuracy on clean images would deteriorate, the exact mechanism in which how this occurs is unclear. In this paper, we study the distribution of softmax induced by stochastic transformations. We observe that with random transformations on the clean images, although the mass of the softmax distribution could shift to the wrong class, the resulting distribution of softmax could be used to correct the prediction. Furthermore, on the adversarial counterparts, with the image transformation, the resulting shapes of the distribution of softmax are similar to the distributions from the clean images. With these observations, we propose a method to improve existing transformation-based defenses. We train a separate lightweight distribution classifier to recognize distinct features in the distributions of softmax outputs of transformed images. Our empirical studies show that our distribution classifier, by training on distributions obtained from clean images only, outperforms majority voting for both clean and adversarial images. Our method is generic and can be integrated with existing transformation-based defenses.
10	"This work views neural networks as data generating systems and applies anomalous pattern detection techniques on that data in order to detect when a network is processing a group of anomalous inputs.  Detecting anomalies is a critical component for multiple machine learning problems including detecting the presence of adversarial noise added to inputs. More broadly, this work is a step towards giving neural networks the ability to detect groups of out-of-distribution samples.  This work introduces ``Subset Scanning methods from the anomalous pattern detection domain to the task of detecting anomalous inputs to neural networks.  Subset Scanning allows us to answer the question: ""``Which subset of inputs have larger-than-expected activations at which subset of nodes?""  Framing the adversarial detection problem this way allows us to identify systematic patterns in the activation space that span multiple adversarially noised images.  Such images are ``""weird together"".  Leveraging this common anomalous pattern, we show increased detection power as the proportion of noised images increases in a test set.   Detection power and accuracy results are provided for targeted adversarial noise added to CIFAR-10 images on a 20-layer ResNet using the Basic Iterative Method attack. "
10	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) filter the input data using a series of spatial convolution operators with compactly supported stencils and point-wise nonlinearities.Commonly, the convolution operators couple features from all channels.For wide networks, this leads to immense computational cost in the training of and prediction with CNNs.In this paper, we present novel ways to parameterize the convolution more efficiently, aiming to decrease the number of parameters in CNNs and their computational complexity.We propose new architectures that use a sparser coupling between the channels and thereby reduce both the number of trainable weights and the computational cost of the CNN.Our architectures arise as new types of residual neural network (ResNet) that can be seen as discretizations of a Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and thus have predictable theoretical properties. Our first architecture involves a convolution operator with a special sparsity structure, and is applicable to a large class of CNNs. Next, we present an architecture that can be seen as a discretization of a diffusion reaction PDE, and use it with three different convolution operators. We outline in our experiments that the proposed architectures,  although considerably reducing the number of trainable weights, yield comparable accuracy to existing CNNs that are fully coupled in the channel dimension.
10	Learning generative probabilistic models that can estimate the continuous density given a set of samples, and that can sample from that density is one of the fundamental challenges in unsupervised machine learning. In this paper we introduce a new approach to obtain such models based on what we call denoising density estimators (DDEs). A DDE is a scalar function, parameterized by a neural network, that is efficiently trained to represent a kernel density estimator of the data. In addition, we show how to leverage DDEs to develop a novel approach to obtain generative models that sample from given densities. We prove that our algorithms to obtain both DDEs and generative models are guaranteed to converge to the correct solutions. Advantages of our approach include that we do not require specific network architectures like in normalizing flows, ODE solvers as in continuous normalizing flows, nor do we require adversarial training as in generative adversarial networks (GANs). Finally, we provide experimental results that demonstrate practical applications of our technique.
10	Model compression can significantly reduce the computation and memory footprint of large neural networks. To achieve a good trade-off between model size and accuracy, popular compression techniques usually rely on hand-crafted heuristics andrequire manually setting the compression ratio of each layer. This process is typically costly and suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Pruning method (MLPrune), which is theoretically sound, and can automatically decide appropriate compression ratios for all layers. Towards this goal, we use an efficient approximation of the Hessian as our pruning criterion, based on a Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several datasets and architectures, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. Our experiments show that we can compress AlexNet and VGG16 by 25x without loss in accuracy on ImageNet. Furthermore, our method has much fewer hyper-parameters and requires no expert knowledge.
01	Graph embedding techniques have been increasingly deployed in a multitude of different applications that involve learning on non-Euclidean data. However, existing graph embedding models either fail to incorporate node attribute information during training or suffer from node attribute noise, which compromises the accuracy. Moreover, very few of them scale to large graphs due to their high computational complexity and memory usage. In this paper we propose GraphZoom, a multi-level framework for improving both accuracy and scalability of unsupervised graph embedding algorithms. GraphZoom first performs graph fusion to generate a new graph that effectively encodes the topology of the original graph and the node attribute information. This fused graph is then repeatedly coarsened into much smaller graphs by merging nodes with high spectral similarities. GraphZoom allows any existing embedding methods to be applied to the coarsened graph, before it progressively refine the embeddings obtained at the coarsest level to increasingly finer graphs. We have evaluated our approach on a number of popular graph datasets for both transductive and inductive tasks. Our experiments show that GraphZoom can substantially increase the classification accuracy and significantly accelerate the entire graph embedding process by up to $40.8 \times$, when compared to the  state-of-the-art unsupervised embedding methods. 
10	We propose a non-adversarial feature matching-based approach to train generative models. Our approach, Generative Feature Matching Networks (GFMN), leverages pretrained neural networks such as autoencoders and ConvNet classifiers to perform feature extraction. We perform an extensive number of experiments with different challenging datasets, including ImageNet. Our experimental results demonstrate that, due to the expressiveness of the features from pretrained ImageNet classifiers, even by just matching first order statistics, our approach can achieve state-of-the-art results for challenging benchmarks such as CIFAR10 and STL10.
01	In many partially observable scenarios, Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must rely on long-term memory in order to learn an optimal policy. We demonstrate that using techniques from NLP and supervised learning fails at RL tasks due to stochasticity from the environment and from exploration. Utilizing our insights on the limitations of traditional memory methods in RL, we propose AMRL, a class of models that can learn better policies with greater sample efficiency and are resilient to noisy inputs. Specifically, our models use a standard memory module to summarize short-term context, and then aggregate all prior states from the standard model without respect to order. We show that this provides advantages both in terms of gradient decay and signal-to-noise ratio over time. Evaluating in Minecraft and maze environments that test long-term memory, we find that our model improves average return by 19% over a baseline that has the same number of parameters and by 9% over a stronger baseline that has far more parameters.
10	To educate hyper deep learners, \emph{Curriculum Learnings} (CLs) require either human heuristic participation or self-deciding the difficulties of training instances. These coaching manners are blind to the coherent structures among examples, categories, and tasks, which are pregnant with more knowledgeable curriculum-routed teachers. In this paper, we propose a general methodology \emph{Teaching to Teach} (T2T). T2T is facilitated by \emph{Structured Dark Knowledge} (SDK) that constitutes a communication protocol between structured knowledge prior and teaching strategies. On one hand, SDK adaptively extracts structured knowledge by selecting a training subset consistent with the previous teaching decisions. On the other hand, SDK teaches curriculum-agnostic teachers by transferring this knowledge to update their teaching policy. This virtuous cycle can be flexibly-deployed in most existing CL platforms and more importantly, very generic across various structured knowledge characteristics, e.g., diversity, complementarity, and causality. We evaluate T2T across different learners, teachers, and tasks, which significantly demonstrates that structured knowledge can be inherited by the teachers to further benefit learners' training.
10	We study model recovery for data classification, where the training labels are generated from a one-hidden-layer fully -connected neural network with sigmoid activations, and the goal is to recover the weight vectors of the neural network. We prove that under Gaussian inputs, the empirical risk function using cross entropy exhibits strong convexity and smoothness uniformly in a local neighborhood of the ground truth, as soon as the sample complexity is sufficiently large. This implies that if initialized in this neighborhood, which can be achieved via the tensor method, gradient descent converges linearly to a critical point that is provably close to the ground truth without requiring a fresh set of samples at each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first global convergence guarantee established for the empirical risk minimization using cross entropy via gradient descent for learning one-hidden-layer neural networks, at the near-optimal sample and computational complexity with respect to the network input dimension.
01	High-dimensional time series are common in many domains. Since human cognition is not optimized to work well in high-dimensional spaces, these areas could benefit from interpretable low-dimensional representations. However, most representation learning algorithms for time series data are difficult to interpret. This is due to non-intuitive mappings from data features to salient properties of the representation and non-smoothness over time.To address this problem, we propose a new representation learning framework building on ideas from interpretable discrete dimensionality reduction and deep generative modeling. This framework allows us to learn discrete representations of time series, which give rise to smooth and interpretable embeddings with superior clustering performance. We introduce a new way to overcome the non-differentiability in discrete representation learning and present a gradient-based version of the traditional self-organizing map algorithm that is more performant than the original. Furthermore, to allow for a probabilistic interpretation of our method, we integrate a Markov model in the representation space.This model uncovers the temporal transition structure, improves clustering performance even further and provides additional explanatory insights as well as a natural representation of uncertainty.We evaluate our model in terms of clustering performance and interpretability on static (Fashion-)MNIST data, a time series of linearly interpolated (Fashion-)MNIST images, a chaotic Lorenz attractor system with two macro states, as well as on a challenging real world medical time series application on the eICU data set. Our learned representations compare favorably with competitor methods and facilitate downstream tasks on the real world data.
10	We re-think the Two-Player Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an instance of a distribution sampling problem in infinite dimensions. Using the powerful Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, we propose a new two-player RL algorithm, which is a sampling variant of the two-player policy gradient method. Our new algorithm consistently outperforms existing baselines, in terms of generalization across differing training and testing conditions, on several MuJoCo environments.
10	"Language modeling tasks, in which words, or word-pieces, are predicted on the basis of a local context, have been very effective for learning word embeddings and context dependent representations of phrases. Motivated by the observation that efforts to code world knowledge into machine readable knowledge bases or human readable encyclopedias tend to be entity-centric, we investigate the use of a fill-in-the-blank task to learn context independent representations of entities from the text contexts in which those entities were mentioned. We show that large scale training of neural models allows us to learn high quality entity representations, and we demonstrate successful results on four domains: (1) existing entity-level typing benchmarks, including a 64% error reduction over previous work on TypeNet (Murty et al., 2018); (2) a novel few-shot category reconstruction task; (3) existing entity linking benchmarks, where we achieve a score of 87.3% on TAC-KBP 2010 without using any alias table, external knowledge base or in domain training data and (4) answering trivia questions, which uniquely identify entities. Our global entity representations encode fine-grained type categories, such as ""Scottish footballers"", and can answer trivia questions such as ""Who was the last inmate of Spandau jail in Berlin?""."
10	Stemming is the process of removing affixes( i.e. prefixes, infixes and suffixes) that improve the accuracy and performance of information retrieval systems.This paper presents the reduction of Amharic words to corresponding stem where with the intention that it preserves semantic information. The proposed approach efficiently removes affixes from an Amharic word. The process of removing such affixes (prefixes, infixes and suffixes) from a word to its base form is called stemming. While many stemmers exist for dominant languages such as English, under resourced languages such as Amharic which lacks such powerful tool support. In this paper, we design a light Amharic stemmer relying on the rules that receives an Amharic word and then it finds a match to the beginning of a word to the possible prefixes and to its ending with the possible suffixes and finally it checks whether it has infix. The final result is the stem if there is any prefix, infix or/and suffix, otherwise it remains in one of the earlier states. The technique does not rely on any additional resource (e.g. dictionary) to verify the generated stem. The performance of the generated stemmer is evaluated using manually annotated Amharic words. The result is compared with current state-of-the-art stemmer for Amharic showing an increase of 7% in stemmer correctness.
01	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as highly successful tools for image generation, recovery, and restoration. A major contributing factor to this success is that convolutional networks impose strong prior assumptions about natural images. A surprising experiment that highlights this architectural bias towards natural images is that one can remove noise and corruptions from a natural image without using any training data, by simply fitting (via gradient descent) a randomly initialized, over-parameterized convolutional generator to the corrupted image. While this over-parameterized network can fit the corrupted image perfectly, surprisingly after a few iterations of gradient descent it generates an almost uncorrupted image. This intriguing phenomenon enables state-of-the-art CNN-based denoising and regularization of other inverse problems. In this paper, we attribute this effect to a particular architectural choice of convolutional networks, namely convolutions with fixed interpolating filters. We then formally characterize the dynamics of fitting a two-layer convolutional generator to a noisy signal and prove that early-stopped gradient descent denoises/regularizes. Our proof relies on showing that convolutional generators fit the structured part of an image significantly faster than the corrupted portion. 
01	We discuss the feasibility of the following learning problem: given unmatched samples from two domains and nothing else, learn a mapping between the two, which preserves semantics. Due to the lack of paired samples and without any definition of the semantic information, the problem might seem ill-posed. Specifically, in typical cases, it seems possible to build infinitely many alternative mappings  from every target mapping. This apparent ambiguity stands in sharp contrast to the recent empirical success in solving this problem.We identify the abstract notion of aligning two domains in a semantic way with concrete terms of minimal relative complexity. A theoretical framework for measuring the complexity of compositions of functions is developed in order to show that it is reasonable to expect the minimal complexity mapping to be unique. The measured complexity used is directly related to the depth of the neural networks being learned and a semantically aligned mapping could then be captured simply by learning using architectures that are not much bigger than the minimal architecture.Various predictions are made based on the hypothesis that semantic alignment can be captured by the minimal mapping. These are verified extensively. In addition, a new mapping algorithm is proposed and shown to lead to better mapping results.
10	In recent years, researchers have seen working on interpreting the insights of deep networks in the pursuit of overcoming their opaqueness and so-called ‘black-box’ tag from them. In this work, we present a new visual interpretation technique that finds out discriminative image locations contributing highly towards networks’ prediction. We select the most contributing set of neurons per layer and engineer the forward pass operation to gradually reach to the important locations of the in-put image. We explore the connectivity structure of the neuron and obtain support from succeeding and preceding layer along with its evidence from current layer to advocate for a neuron’s importance. While conducting this operation, we also add priorities to the supports from neighboring layers, which, in practice, provides a reliable way of selecting the discriminative set of neurons for the target layer.We conduct both the objective and subjective evaluations to examine the performance of our method in terms of model’s faithfulness and human-trust, where we visualize its efficacy over other existing methods.
10	Continuous embeddings of tokens in computer programs have been used to support a variety of software development tools, including readability, code search, and program repair. Contextual embeddings are common in natural language processing but have not been previously applied in software engineering.We introduce a new set of deep contextualized word representations for computer programs based on language models.We train a set of embeddings using the ELMo (embeddings from language models) framework of Peters et al (2018).We investigate whether these embeddings are effective when fine-tuned for the downstream task of bug detection.We show that even a low-dimensional embedding trained on a relatively small corpus of programs can improve a state-of-the-art machine learning system for bug detection.
10	Multi-task learning promises to use less data, parameters, and time than training separate single-task models. But realizing these benefits in practice is challenging. In particular, it is difficult to define a suitable architecture that has enough capacity to support many tasks while not requiring excessive compute for each individual task. There are difficult trade-offs when deciding how to allocate parameters and layers across a large set of tasks. To address this, we propose a method for automatically searching over multi-task architectures that accounts for resource constraints. We define a parameterization of feature sharing strategies for effective coverage and sampling of architectures. We also present a method for quick evaluation of such architectures with feature distillation. Together these contributions allow us to quickly optimize for parameter-efficient multi-task models. We benchmark on Visual Decathlon, demonstrating that we can automatically search for and identify architectures that effectively make trade-offs between task resource requirements while maintaining a high level of final performance.
01	Recent work suggests goal-driven training of neural networks can be used to model neural activity in the brain. While response properties of neurons in artificial neural networks bear similarities to those in the brain, the network architectures are often constrained to be different. Here we ask if a neural network can recover both neural representations and, if the architecture is unconstrained and optimized, also the anatomical properties of neural circuits. We demonstrate this in a system where the connectivity and the functional organization have been characterized, namely, the head direction circuit of the rodent and fruit fly. We trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to estimate head direction through integration of angular velocity. We found that the two distinct classes of neurons observed in the head direction system, the Compass neurons and the Shifter neurons, emerged naturally in artificial neural networks as a result of training. Furthermore, connectivity analysis and in-silico neurophysiology revealed structural and mechanistic similarities between artificial networks and the head direction system. Overall, our results show that optimization of RNNs in a goal-driven task can recapitulate the structure and function of biological circuits, suggesting that artificial neural networks can be used to study the brain at the level of both neural activity and anatomical organization.
10	Silo discharging and monitoring the process forindustrial or research application depend on computerizedsegmentation of different parts of images such as stagnant andflowing zones which is the toughest task. X-ray ComputedTomography (CT) is one of a powerful non-destructive techniquefor cross-sectional images of a 3D object based on X-rayabsorption. CT is the most proficient for investigating differentgranular flow phenomena and segmentation of the stagnant zoneas compared to other imaging techniques. In any case, manualsegmentation is tiresome and erroneous for further investigations.Hence, automatic and precise strategies are required. In thepresent work, a U-net architecture is used for segmenting thestagnant zone during silo discharging process. This proposedimage segmentation method provides fast and effective outcomesby exploiting a convolutional neural networks technique with anaccuracy of 97 percent
10	Unsupervised representation learning holds the promise of exploiting large amount of available unlabeled data to learn general representations. A promising technique for unsupervised learning is the framework of Variational Auto-encoders (VAEs). However, unsupervised representations learned by VAEs are significantly outperformed by those learned by supervising for recognition. Our hypothesis is that to learn useful representations for recognition the model needs to be encouraged to learn about repeating and consistent patterns in data. Drawing inspiration from the mid-level representation discovery work, we propose PatchVAE, that reasons about images at patch level. Our key contribution is a bottleneck formulation in a VAE framework that encourages mid-level style representations. Our experiments demonstrate that representations learned by our method perform much better on the recognition tasks compared to those learned by vanilla VAEs.
01	We propose Stochastic Weight Averaging in Parallel (SWAP), an algorithm to accelerate DNN training. Our algorithm uses large mini-batches to compute an approximate solution quickly and then refines it by averaging the weights of multiple models computed independently and in parallel. The resulting models generalize equally well as those trained with small mini-batches but are produced in a substantially shorter time. We demonstrate the reduction in training time and the good generalization performance of the resulting models on the computer vision datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.
10	We investigated the changes in visual representations learnt by CNNs when using different linguistic labels (e.g., trained with basic-level labels only, superordinate-level only, or both at the same time) and how they compare to human behavior when asked to select which of three images is most different. We compared CNNs with identical architecture and input, differing only in what labels were used to supervise the training. The results showed that in the absence of labels, the models learn very little categorical structure that is often assumed to be in the input. Models trained with superordinate labels (vehicle, tool, etc.) are most helpful in allowing the models to match human categorization, implying that human representations used in odd-one-out tasks are highly modulated by semantic information not obviously present in the visual input.
10	Survival Analysis (time-to-event analysis) in the presence of multiple possible adverse events, i.e., competing risks, is a challenging, yet very important problem in medicine, finance, manufacturing, etc. Extending classical survival analysis to competing risks is not trivial since only one event (e.g. one cause of death) is observed and hence, the incidence of an event of interest is often obscured by other related competing events. This leads to the nonidentifiability of the event times’ distribution parameters, which makes the problem significantly more challenging. In this work we introduce Siamese Survival Prognosis Network, a novel Siamese Deep Neural Network architecture that is able to effectively learn from data in the presence of multiple adverse events. The Siamese Survival Network is especially crafted to issue pairwise concordant time-dependent risks, in which longer event times are assigned lower risks. Furthermore, our architecture is able to directly optimize an approximation to the C-discrimination index, rather than relying on well-known metrics of cross-entropy etc., and which are not able to capture the unique requirements of survival analysis with competing risks. Our results show consistent performance improvements on a number of publicly available medical datasets over both statistical and deep learning state-of-the-art methods.
01	We study the problem of representation learning in goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning. In such hierarchical structures, a higher-level controller solves tasks by iteratively communicating goals which a lower-level policy is trained to reach. Accordingly, the choice of representation -- the mapping of observation space to goal space -- is crucial. To study this problem, we develop a notion of sub-optimality of a representation, defined in terms of expected reward of the optimal hierarchical policy using this representation. We derive expressions which bound the sub-optimality and show how these expressions can be translated to representation learning objectives which may be optimized in practice. Results on a number of difficult continuous-control tasks show that our approach to representation learning yields qualitatively better representations as well as quantitatively better hierarchical policies, compared to existing methods.
10	Social dilemmas are situations where individuals face a temptation to increase their payoffs at a cost to total welfare. Building artificially intelligent agents that achieve good outcomes in these situations is important because many real world interactions include a tension between selfish interests and the welfare of others. We show how to modify modern reinforcement learning methods to construct agents that act in ways that are simple to understand, nice (begin by cooperating), provokable (try to avoid being exploited), and forgiving (try to return to mutual cooperation). We show both theoretically and experimentally that such agents can maintain cooperation in Markov social dilemmas. Our construction does not require training methods beyond a modification of self-play, thus if an environment is such that good strategies can be constructed in the zero-sum case (eg. Atari) then we can construct agents that solve social dilemmas in this environment. 
10	Deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) andVariational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are important tools to capture and investigatethe properties of complex empirical data. However, the complexity of their innerelements makes their functionment challenging to assess and modify. In thisrespect, these architectures behave as black box models. In order to betterunderstand the function of such networks, we analyze their modularity based onthe counterfactual manipulation of their internal variables. Our experiments on thegeneration of human faces with VAEs and GANs support that modularity betweenactivation maps distributed over channels of generator architectures is achievedto some degree, can be used to better understand how these systems operate and allow meaningful transformations of the generated images without further training.erate and edit the content of generated images.
10	Building chatbots that can accomplish goals such as booking a flight ticket is an unsolved problem in natural language understanding. Much progress has been made to build conversation models using techniques such as sequence2sequence modeling. One challenge in applying such techniques to building goal-oriented conversation models is that maximum likelihood-based models are not optimized toward accomplishing goals. Recently, many methods have been proposed to address this issue by optimizing a reward that contains task status or outcome. However, adding the reward optimization on the fly usually provides little guidance for language construction and the conversation model soon becomes decoupled from the language model. In this paper, we propose a new setting in goal-oriented dialogue system to tighten the gap between these two aspects by enforcing model level information isolation on individual models between two agents. Language construction now becomes an important part in reward optimization since it is the only way information can be exchanged. We experimented our models using self-play and results showed that our method not only beat the baseline sequence2sequence model in rewards but can also generate human-readable meaningful conversations of comparable quality. 
01	Deep learning natural language processing models often use vector word embeddings, such as word2vec or GloVe, to represent words. A discrete sequence of words can be much more easily integrated with downstream neural layers if it is represented as a  sequence of continuous vectors. Also, semantic relationships between words, learned from a text corpus, can be encoded in the relative configurations of the embedding vectors. However, storing and accessing embedding vectors for all words in a dictionary requires large amount of space, and may stain systems with limited GPU memory. Here, we used approaches inspired by quantum computing to propose two related methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, for storing word embedding matrix during training and inference in a highly efficient way. Our approach achieves a hundred-fold or more reduction in the space required to store the embeddings with almost no relative drop in accuracy in practical natural language processing tasks.
01	Understanding the flow of information in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a challenging problem that has gain increasing attention over the last few years. While several methods have been proposed to explain network predictions, there have been only a few attempts to compare them from a theoretical perspective. What is more, no exhaustive empirical comparison has been performed in the past. In this work we analyze four gradient-based attribution methods and formally prove conditions of equivalence and approximation between them. By reformulating two of these methods, we construct a unified framework which enables a direct comparison, as well as an easier implementation. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, called Sensitivity-n and test the gradient-based attribution methods alongside with a simple perturbation-based attribution method on several datasets in the domains of image and text classification, using various network architectures.
01	Responding with knowledge has been recognized as an important capability for an intelligent conversational agent. Yet knowledge-grounded dialogues, as training data for learning such a response generation model, are difficult to obtain. Motivated by the challenge in practice, we consider knowledge-grounded dialogue generation under a natural assumption that only limited training examples are available. In such a low-resource setting, we devise a disentangled response decoder in order to isolate parameters that depend on knowledge-grounded dialogues from the entire generation model. By this means, the major part of the model can be learned from a large number of ungrounded dialogues and unstructured documents, while the remaining small parameters can be well fitted using the limited training examples. Evaluation results on two benchmarks indicate that with only $1/8$ training data, our model can achieve the state-of-the-art performance and generalize well on out-of-domain knowledge. 
01	We consider the problem of detecting  out-of-distribution images in neural networks. We propose ODIN, a simple and effective method that does not require any change to a pre-trained neural network. Our method is based on the observation that using temperature scaling and adding small perturbations to the input can  separate the softmax score distributions of in- and out-of-distribution images, allowing for more effective detection. We show in a series of experiments that ODIN is compatible with diverse network architectures and datasets. It consistently outperforms the baseline approach by a large margin, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance on this task. For example, ODIN reduces the false positive rate from the baseline 34.7% to 4.3% on the DenseNet (applied to CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet) when the true positive rate is 95%.
10	We propose Adaptive Sample-space & Adaptive Probability (ASAP) coding, an efficient neural-network based method for lossy data compression.Our ASAP coding distinguishes itself from the conventional method based on adaptive arithmetic coding in that it models the probability distribution for the quantization process in such a way that one can conduct back-propagation for the quantization width that determines the support of the distribution. Our ASAP also trains the model with a novel, hyper-parameter free multiplicative loss for the rate-distortion tradeoff.  With our ASAP encoder, we are able to compress the image files in the Kodak dataset to as low as one fifth the size of the JPEG-compressed image without compromising their visual quality, and achieved the state-of-the-art result in terms of MS-SSIM based rate-distortion tradeoff. 
10	Generative Adversarial Networks have made data generation possible in various use cases, but in case of complex, high-dimensional distributions it can be difficult to train them, because of convergence problems and the appearance of mode collapse.Sliced Wasserstein GANs and especially the application of the Max-Sliced Wasserstein distance made it possible to approximate Wasserstein distance during training in an efficient and stable way and helped ease convergence problems of these architectures.This method transforms sample assignment and distance calculation into sorting the one-dimensional projection of the samples, which results a sufficient approximation of the high-dimensional Wasserstein distance. In this paper we will demonstrate that the approximation of the Wasserstein distance by sorting the samples is not always the optimal approach and the greedy assignment of the real and fake samples can result faster convergence and better approximation of the original distribution.
01	Real-world tasks are often highly structured. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has attracted research interest as an approach for leveraging the hierarchical structure of a given task in reinforcement learning (RL). However, identifying the hierarchical policy structure that enhances the performance of RL is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose an HRL method that learns a latent variable of a hierarchical policy using mutual information maximization. Our approach can be interpreted as a way to learn a discrete and latent representation of the state-action space. To learn option policies that correspond to modes of the advantage function, we introduce advantage-weighted importance sampling.  In our HRL method, the gating policy learns to select option policies based on an option-value function, and these option policies are optimized based on the deterministic policy gradient method. This framework is derived by leveraging the analogy between a monolithic policy in standard RL and a hierarchical policy in HRL by using a deterministic option policy.  Experimental results indicate that our HRL approach can learn a diversity of options and that it can enhance the performance of RL in continuous control tasks.
01	One of the distinguishing aspects of human language is its compositionality, which allows us to describe complex environments with limited vocabulary. Previously, it has been shown that neural network agents can learn to communicate in a highly structured, possibly compositional language based on disentangled input (e.g. hand- engineered features). Humans, however, do not learn to communicate based on well-summarized features. In this work, we train neural agents to simultaneously develop visual perception from raw image pixels, and learn to communicate with a sequence of discrete symbols. The agents play an image description game where the image contains factors such as colors and shapes. We train the agents using the obverter technique where an agent introspects to generate messages that maximize its own understanding. Through qualitative analysis, visualization and a zero-shot test, we show that the agents can develop, out of raw image pixels, a language with compositional properties, given a proper pressure from the environment.
10	In this paper, we are interested in two seemingly different concepts: \textit{adversarial training} and \textit{generative adversarial networks (GANs)}. Particularly, how these techniques work to improve each other. To this end, we analyze the limitation of adversarial training as a defense method, starting from questioning how well the robustness of a model can generalize. Then, we successfully improve the generalizability via data augmentation by the ``fake'' images sampled from generative adversarial network. After that, we are surprised to see that the resulting robust classifier leads to a better generator, for free. We intuitively explain this interesting phenomenon and leave the theoretical analysis for future work.Motivated by these observations, we propose a system that combines generator, discriminator, and adversarial attacker together in a single network. After end-to-end training and fine tuning, our method can simultaneously improve the robustness of classifiers, measured by accuracy under strong adversarial attacks, and the quality of generators, evaluated both aesthetically and quantitatively. In terms of the classifier, we achieve better robustness than the state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithm proposed in (Madry \textit{et al.}, 2017), while our generator achieves competitive performance compared with SN-GAN (Miyato and Koyama, 2018).
01	Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be huge in size, requiring a considerable a mount of energy and computational resources to operate, which limits their applications in numerous scenarios. It is thus of interest to compress DNNs while maintaining their performance levels.  We here propose a probabilistic importance inference approach for pruning DNNs. Specifically, we test the significance of the relevance of a connection in a DNN to the DNN’s outputs using a nonparemtric scoring testand keep only those significant ones. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves better lossless compression rates than existing techniques
01	We introduce a new algorithm for reinforcement learning called Maximum a-posteriori Policy Optimisation (MPO) based on coordinate ascent on a relative-entropy objective. We show that several existing methods can directly be related to our derivation. We develop two off-policy algorithms and demonstrate that they are competitive with the state-of-the-art in deep reinforcement learning. In particular, for continuous control, our method outperforms existing methods with respect to sample efficiency, premature convergence and robustness to hyperparameter settings.
10	Generative models with both discrete and continuous latent variables are highly motivated by the structure of many real-world data sets. They present, however, subtleties in training often manifesting in the discrete latent variable not being leveraged. In this paper, we show why such models struggle to train using traditional log-likelihood maximization, and that they are amenable to training using the Optimal Transport framework of Wasserstein Autoencoders. We find our discrete latent variable to be fully leveraged by the model when trained, without any modifications to the objective function or significant fine tuning. Our model generates comparable samples to other approaches while using relatively simple neural networks, since the discrete latent variable carries much of the descriptive burden. Furthermore, the discrete latent provides significant control over generation.
10	Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) is the task of producing a high resolution (HR) image from a given low-resolution (LR) image. It is a well researched prob- lem with extensive commercial applications like digital camera, video compres- sion, medical imaging, etc. Most recent super resolution works focus on the fea- ture learning architecture, like Chao Dong (2016); Dong et al. (2016); Wang et al. (2018b); Ledig et al. (2017). However, these works suffer from the following chal- lenges: (1) The low-resolution (LR) training images are artificially synthesized us- ing HR images with bicubic downsampling, which have much more information than real demosaic-upscaled images. The mismatch between training and realistic mobile data heavily blocks the effect on practical SR problem. (2) These methods cannot effectively handle the blind distortions during super resolution in practical applications. In this work, an end-to-end novel framework, including high-to-low network and low-to-high network, is proposed to solve the above problems with dual Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). First, the above mismatch prob- lems are well explored with the high-to-low network, where clear high-resolution image and the corresponding realistic low-resolution image pairs can be gener- ated. With high-to-low network, a large-scale General Mobile Super Resolution Dataset, GMSR, is proposed, which can be utilized for training or as a bench- mark for super resolution methods. Second, an effective low-to-high network (super resolution network) is proposed in the framework. Benefiting from the GMSR dataset and novel training strategies, the proposed super resolution model can effectively handle detail recovery and denoising at the same time.
10	A commonplace belief in the machine learning community is that using adaptive gradient methods hurts generalization. We re-examine this belief both theoretically and experimentally, in light of insights and trends from recent years.We revisit some previous oft-cited experiments and theoretical accounts in more depth, and provide a new set of experiments in larger-scale, state-of-the-art settings. We conclude that with proper tuning, the improved training performance of adaptive optimizers does not in general carry an overfitting penalty, especially in contemporary deep learning. Finally, we synthesize a ``user's guide'' to adaptive optimizers, including some proposed modifications to AdaGrad to mitigate some of its empirical shortcomings.
10	Sequence labeling is a fundamental framework for various natural language processing problems including part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. Its performance is largely influenced by the annotation quality and quantity in supervised learning scenarios.  In many cases, ground truth labels are costly and time-consuming to collect or even non-existent,  while imperfect ones could be easily accessed or transferred from different domains. A typical example is crowd-sourced datasets which have multiple annotations for each sentence which may be noisy or incomplete.   Additionally,  predictions from multiple source models in transfer learning can be seen as a case of multi-source supervision.  In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Consensus Network (CONNET) to conduct training with imperfect annotations from multiple sources.   It learns the representation for every weak supervision source and dynamically aggregates them by a context-aware attention mechanism.  Finally, it leads to a model reflecting the consensus among multiple sources.  We evaluate the proposed framework in two practical settings of multi-source learning:  learning with crowd annotations and unsupervised cross-domain model adaptation. Extensive experimental results show that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods in both settings.
10	Adversarial examples have been well known as a serious threat to deep neuralnetworks (DNNs). To ensure successful and safe operations of DNNs on realworld tasks, it is urgent to equip DNNs with effective defense strategies. In thiswork, we study the detection of adversarial examples, based on the assumptionthat the output and internal responses of one DNN model for both adversarial andbenign examples follow the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD), but withdifferent parameters (i.e., shape factor, mean, and variance). GGD is a generaldistribution family to cover many popular distributions (e.g., Laplacian, Gaussian,or uniform). It is more likely to approximate the intrinsic distributions of internalresponses than any specific distribution. Besides, since the shape factor is morerobust to different databases rather than the other two parameters, we proposeto construct discriminative features via the shape factor for adversarial detection,employing the magnitude of Benford-Fourier coefficients (MBF), which can beeasily estimated using responses. Finally, a support vector machine is trainedas the adversarial detector through leveraging the MBF features. Through theKolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, we empirically verify that: 1) the posterior vectors of both adversarial and benign examples follow GGD; 2) the extracted MBF features of adversarial and benign examples follow different distributions. Extensive experiments in terms of image classification demonstrate that the proposed detector is much more effective and robust on detecting adversarial examples of different crafting methods and different sources, in contrast to state-of-the-art adversarial detection methods.
10	For semantic image segmentation and lane detection, nets with a single spatial pyramid structure or encoder-decoder structure are usually exploited. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show great results on both high-level and low-level features representations, however, the capability has not been fully embodied for lane detection task. In especial, it's still a challenge for model-based lane detection to combine the multi-scale context with a pixel-level accuracy because of the weak visual appearance and strong prior information. In this paper, we we propose an novel network for lane detection, the three main contributions are as follows. First, we employ multiple encoder-decoders module in end-to-end ways and show the promising results for lane detection. Second, we analysis different configurations of multiple encoder-decoders nets. Third, we make our attempts to rethink the evaluation methods of lane detection for the limitation of the popular methods based on IoU.
10	There has recently been a heated debate (e.g. Schwartz-Ziv & Tishby (2017), Saxe et al. (2018), Noshad et al. (2018), Goldfeld et al. (2018)) about measuring the information flow in Deep Neural Networks using techniques from information theory. It is claimed that Deep Neural Networks in general have good generalization capabilities since they not only learn how to map from an input to an output but also how to compress information about the training data input (Schwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017). That is, they abstract the input information and strip down any unnecessary or over-specific information. If so, the message compression method, Information Bottleneck (IB), could be used as a natural comparator for network performance, since this method gives an optimal information compression boundary. This claim was then later denounced as well as reaffirmed (e.g.  Saxe et al. (2018), Achille et al. (2017), Noshad et al. (2018)), as the employed method of mutual information measuring is not actually measuring information but clustering of the internal layer representations (Goldfeld et al. (2018)). In this paper, we will present a detailed explanation of the development in the Information Plain (IP), which is a plot-type that compares mutual information to judge compression (Schwartz-Ziv & Tishby (2017)), when noise is retroactively added (using binning estimation).  We also explain why different activation functions show different trajectories on the IP. Further, we have looked into the effect of clustering on the network loss through early and perfect stopping using the Information Plane and how clustering can be used to help network pruning.
10	This work explores the visual explanation for deep metric learning and its applications. As an important problem for learning representation, metric learning has attracted much attention recently, while the interpretation of such model is not as well studied as classification. To this end, we propose an intuitive idea to show where contributes the most to the overall similarity of two input images by decomposing the final activation. Instead of only providing the overall activation map of each image, we propose to generate point-to-point activation intensity between two images so that the relationship between different regions is uncovered. We show that the proposed framework can be directly deployed to a large range of metric learning applications and provides valuable information for understanding the model. Furthermore, our experiments show its effectiveness on two potential applications, i.e. cross-view pattern discovery and interactive retrieval. 
01	Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is notoriously challenging. We propose and study an architectural modification, self-modulation, which improves GAN performance across different data sets, architectures, losses, regularizers, and hyperparameter settings. Intuitively, self-modulation allows the intermediate feature maps of a generator to change as a function of the input noise vector. While reminiscent of other conditioning techniques, it requires no labeled data. In a large-scale empirical study we observe a relative decrease of 5%-35% in FID. Furthermore, all else being equal, adding this modification to the generator leads to improved performance in 124/144 (86%) of the studied settings. Self-modulation is a simple architectural change that requires no additional parameter tuning, which suggests that it can be applied readily to any GAN.
10	Current Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods  can exhibit both data inefficiency and brittleness, which seem to indicate that they generalize poorly. In this work, we experimentally analyze this issue through the lens of memorization, and show that it can be observed directly during training. More precisely, we find that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained with supervised tasks on trajectories capture temporal structure well, but DNNs trained with TD(0) methods struggle to do so, while using TD(lambda) targets leads to better generalization.
10	To analyze deep ReLU network, we adopt a student-teacher setting in which an over-parameterized student network learns from the output of a fixed teacher network of the same depth, with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Our contributions are two-fold. First, we prove that when the gradient is zero (or bounded above by a small constant) at every data point in training, a situation called  \emph{interpolation setting}, there exists many-to-one \emph{alignment} between student and teacher nodes in the lowest layer under mild conditions. This suggests that generalization in unseen dataset is achievable, even the same condition often leads to zero training error. Second, analysis of noisy recovery and training dynamics in 2-layer network shows that strong teacher nodes (with large fan-out weights) are learned first and subtle teacher nodes are left unlearned until late stage of training. As a result, it could take a long time to converge into these small-gradient critical points. Our analysis shows that over-parameterization plays two roles: (1) it is a necessary condition for alignment to happen at the critical points, and (2) in training dynamics, it helps student nodes cover more teacher nodes with fewer iterations. Both improve generalization. Experiments justify our finding.
10	In this paper, we aim to develop a simple and scalable reinforcement learning algorithm that uses standard supervised learning methods as subroutines. Our goal is an algorithm that utilizes only simple and convergent maximum likelihood loss functions, while also being able to leverage off-policy data. Our proposed approach, which we refer to as advantage-weighted regression (AWR), consists of two standard supervised learning steps: one to regress onto target values for a value function, and another to regress onto weighted target actions for the policy. The method is simple and general, can accommodate continuous and discrete actions, and can be implemented in just a few lines of code on top of standard supervised learning methods. We provide a theoretical motivation for AWR and analyze its properties when incorporating off-policy data from experience replay. We evaluate AWR on a suite of standard OpenAI Gym benchmark tasks, and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to a number of well-established state-of-the-art RL algorithms. AWR is also able to acquire more effective policies than most off-policy algorithms when learning from purely static datasets with no additional environmental interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate our algorithm on challenging continuous control tasks with highly complex simulated characters.
01	Training with larger number of parameters while keeping fast iterations is an increasinglyadopted strategy and trend for developing better performing Deep NeuralNetwork (DNN) models. This necessitates increased memory footprint andcomputational requirements for training. Here we introduce a novel methodologyfor training deep neural networks using 8-bit floating point (FP8) numbers.Reduced bit precision allows for a larger effective memory and increased computationalspeed. We name this method Shifted and Squeezed FP8 (S2FP8). Weshow that, unlike previous 8-bit precision training methods, the proposed methodworks out of the box for representative models: ResNet50, Transformer and NCF.The method can maintain model accuracy without requiring fine-tuning loss scalingparameters or keeping certain layers in single precision. We introduce twolearnable statistics of the DNN tensors - shifted and squeezed factors that are usedto optimally adjust the range of the tensors in 8-bits, thus minimizing the loss ininformation due to quantization.
01	Capsule networks are constrained by the parameter-expensive nature of their layers, and the general lack of provable equivariance guarantees. We present a variation of capsule networks that aims to remedy this. We identify that learning all pair-wise part-whole relationships between capsules of successive layers is inefficient. Further, we also realise that the choice of prediction networks and the routing mechanism are both key to equivariance. Based on these, we propose an alternative framework for capsule networks that learns to projectively encode the manifold of pose-variations, termed the space-of-variation (SOV), for every capsule-type of each layer. This is done using a trainable, equivariant function defined over a grid of group-transformations. Thus, the prediction-phase of routing involves projection into the SOV of a deeper capsule using the corresponding function. As a specific instantiation of this idea, and also in order to reap the benefits of increased parameter-sharing, we use type-homogeneous group-equivariant convolutions of shallower capsules in this phase. We also introduce an equivariant routing mechanism based on degree-centrality. We show that this particular instance of our general model is equivariant, and hence preserves the compositional representation of an input under transformations. We conduct several experiments on standard object-classification datasets that showcase the increased transformation-robustness, as well as general performance, of our model to several capsule baselines.
10	Structure from motion (SfM) is an essential computer vision problem which has not been well handled by deep learning. One of the promising trends is to apply explicit structural constraint, e.g. 3D cost volume, into the network. In this work, we design a physical driven architecture, namely DeepSFM, inspired by traditional Bundle Adjustment (BA), which consists of two cost volume based architectures for depth and pose estimation respectively, iteratively running  to improve both. In each cost volume, we encode not only photo-metric consistency across multiple input images, but also geometric consistency to ensure that depths from multiple views agree with each other. The explicit constraints on both depth (structure) and pose (motion), when combined with the learning components, bring the merit from both traditional BA and emerging deep learning technology. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both depth and pose estimation with superior robustness against less number of inputs and the noise in initialization.
01	In practice it is often found that large over-parameterized neural networks generalize better than their smaller counterparts, an observation that appears to conflict with classical notions of function complexity, which typically favor smaller models. In this work, we investigate this tension between complexity and generalization through an extensive empirical exploration of two natural metrics of complexity related to sensitivity to input perturbations. Our experiments survey thousands of models with different architectures, optimizers, and other hyper-parameters, as well as four different image classification datasets.We find that trained neural networks are more robust to input perturbations in the vicinity of the training data manifold, as measured by the input-output Jacobian of the network, and that this correlates well with generalization. We further establish that factors associated with poor generalization -- such as full-batch training or using random labels -- correspond to higher sensitivity, while factors associated with good generalization  -- such as data augmentation and ReLU non-linearities -- give rise to more robust functions. Finally, we demonstrate how the input-output Jacobian norm can be predictive of generalization at the level of individual test points.
10	We introduce a novel embedding of directed graphs derived from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the  normalized adjacency matrix. Specifically, we show that, after proper normalization of the singular vectors,   the  distances between vectors in  the embedding space are proportional to the mean commute times between the corresponding  nodes by a  forward-backward random walk in the graph, which follows the edges  alternately in forward and backward directions.  In particular, two nodes having many common successors in the graph tend to be represented by close vectors in the embedding space. More formally, we prove that our representation of the graph is  equivalent to the spectral embedding of some co-citation graph, where  nodes are linked with respect to their common set of successors in the original graph. The interest of our approach is that it does not require to build this co-citation graph, which is typically much denser than the original graph. Experiments  on  real datasets show the efficiency of the approach. 
10	Policy optimization struggles when the reward feedback signal is very sparse and essentially becomes a random search algorithm until the agent stumbles upon a rewarding or the goal state. Recent works utilize intrinsic motivation to guide the exploration via generative models, predictive forward models, or more ad-hoc measures of surprise. We propose EMI, which is an exploration method that constructs embedding representation of states and actions that does not rely on generative decoding of the full observation but extracts predictive signals that can be used to guide exploration based on forward prediction in the representation space. Our experiments show the state of the art performance on challenging locomotion task with continuous control and on image-based exploration tasks with discrete actions on Atari.
10	Existing black-box attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) so far have largely focused on transferability, where an adversarial instance generated for a locally trained model can “transfer” to attack other learning models. In this paper, we propose novel Gradient Estimation black-box attacks for adversaries with query access to the target model’s class probabilities, which do not rely on transferability. We also propose strategies to decouple the number of queries required to generate each adversarial sample from the dimensionality of the input. An iterative variant of our attack achieves close to 100% adversarial success rates for both targeted and untargeted attacks on DNNs. We carry out extensive experiments for a thorough comparative evaluation of black-box attacks and show that the proposed Gradient Estimation attacks outperform all transferability based black-box attacks we tested on both MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, achieving adversarial success rates similar to well known, state-of-the-art white-box attacks. We also apply the Gradient Estimation attacks successfully against a real-world content moderation classiﬁer hosted by Clarifai. Furthermore, we evaluate black-box attacks against state-of-the-art defenses. We show that the Gradient Estimation attacks are very effective even against these defenses.
01	Since deep neural networks are over-parameterized, they can memorize noisy examples. We address such memorizing issue in the presence of annotation noise. From the fact that deep neural networks cannot generalize neighborhoods of the features acquired via memorization, we hypothesize that noisy examples do not consistently incur small losses on the network under a certain perturbation. Based on this, we propose a novel training method called Learning with Ensemble Consensus (LEC) that prevents overfitting noisy examples by eliminating them using the consensus of an ensemble of perturbed networks. One of the proposed LECs, LTEC outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on noisy MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 in an efficient manner.
10	An objective of pro-activity in dialog systems is to enhance the usability of conversationalagents by enabling them to initiate conversation on their own. Whiledialog systems have become increasingly popular during the last couple of years,current task oriented dialog systems are still mainly reactive and users tend toinitiate conversations. In this paper, we propose to introduce the paradigm of contextualbandits as framework for pro-active dialog systems. Contextual banditshave been the model of choice for the problem of reward maximization with partialfeedback since they fit well to the task description. As a second contribution,we introduce and explore the notion of memory into this paradigm. We proposetwo differentiable memory models that act as parts of the parametric reward estimationfunction. The first one, Convolutional Selective Memory Networks, usesa selection of past interactions as part of the decision support. The second model,called Contextual Attentive Memory Network, implements a differentiable attentionmechanism over the past interactions of the agent. The goal is to generalizethe classic model of contextual bandits to settings where temporal informationneeds to be incorporated and leveraged in a learnable manner. Finally, we illustratethe usability and performance of our model for building a pro-active mobileassistant through an extensive set of experiments.
10	Most deep learning for NLP represents each word with a single point or single-mode region in semantic space, while the existing multi-mode word embeddings cannot represent longer word sequences like phrases or sentences. We introduce a phrase representation (also applicable to sentences) where each phrase has a distinct set of multi-mode codebook embeddings to capture different semantic facets of the phrase's meaning. The codebook embeddings can be viewed as the cluster centers which summarize the distribution of possibly co-occurring words in a pre-trained word embedding space. We propose an end-to-end trainable neural model that directly predicts the set of cluster centers from the input text sequence (e.g., a phrase or a sentence) during test time. We find that the per-phrase/sentence codebook embeddings not only provide a more interpretable semantic representation but also outperform strong baselines (by a large margin in some tasks) on benchmark datasets for unsupervised phrase similarity, sentence similarity, hypernym detection, and extractive summarization.
10	One form of characterizing the expressiveness of a piecewise linear neural network is by the number of linear regions, or pieces, of the function modeled. We have observed substantial progress in this topic through lower and upper bounds on the maximum number of linear regions and a counting procedure. However, these bounds only account for the dimensions of the network and the exact counting may take a prohibitive amount of time, therefore making it infeasible to benchmark the expressiveness of networks. In this work, we approximate the number of linear regions of specific rectifier networks with an algorithm for probabilistic lower bounds of mixed-integer linear sets. In addition, we present a tighter upper bound that leverages network coefficients. We test both on trained networks. The algorithm for probabilistic lower bounds is several orders of magnitude faster than exact counting and the values reach similar orders of magnitude, hence making our approach a viable method to compare the expressiveness of such networks. The refined upper bound is particularly stronger on networks with narrow layers.  
10	While deep learning-based classification is generally addressed using standardized approaches, a wide variety of techniques are employed for regression. In computer vision, one particularly popular such technique is that of confidence-based regression, which entails predicting a confidence value for each input-target pair (x, y). While this approach has demonstrated impressive results, it requires important task-dependent design choices, and the predicted confidences often lack a natural probabilistic meaning. We address these issues by proposing Deep Conditional Target Densities (DCTD), a novel and general regression method with a clear probabilistic interpretation. DCTD models the conditional target density p(y|x) by using a neural network to directly predict the un-normalized density from (x, y). This model of p(y|x) is trained by minimizing the associated negative log-likelihood, approximated using Monte Carlo sampling. We perform comprehensive experiments on four computer vision regression tasks. Our approach outperforms direct regression, as well as other probabilistic and confidence-based methods. Notably, our regression model achieves a 1.9% AP improvement over Faster-RCNN for object detection on the COCO dataset, and sets a new state-of-the-art on visual tracking when applied for bounding box regression.
01	Model-based reinforcement learning has been empirically demonstrated as a successful strategy to improve sample efficiency. In particular, Dyna is an elegant model-based architecture integrating learning and planning that provides huge flexibility of using a model. One of the most important components in Dyna is called search-control, which refers to the process of generating state or state-action pairs from which we query the model to acquire simulated experiences. Search-control is critical in improving learning efficiency. In this work, we propose a simple and novel search-control strategy by searching high frequency regions of the value function. Our main intuition is built on Shannon sampling theorem from signal processing, which indicates that a high frequency signal requires more samples to reconstruct. We empirically show that a high frequency function is more difficult to approximate. This suggests a search-control strategy: we should use states from high frequency regions of the value function to query the model to acquire more samples. We develop a simple strategy to locally measure the frequency of a function by gradient and hessian norms, and provide theoretical justification for this approach. We then apply our strategy to search-control in Dyna, and conduct experiments to show its property and effectiveness on benchmark domains.
10	The search-based reinforcement learning algorithm AlphaZero has been used as a general method formastering two-player games Go, chess and Shogi. One crucial ingredient in AlphaZero (and its predecessor AlphaGo Zero) is the two-head network architecture that outputs two estimates --- policy and value --- for one input game state. The merit of such an architecture is that letting policy and value learning share the same representation substantially improved generalization of the neural net.   A three-head network architecture has been recently proposed that can learn a third action-value head on a fixed dataset the same as for two-head net. Also, using the action-value head in Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) improved the search efficiency. However, effectiveness of the three-head network has not been investigated in an AlphaZero style learning paradigm. In this paper, using the game of Hex as a test domain, we conduct an empirical study of the three-head network architecture in AlpahZero learning. We show that the architecture is also advantageous at the zero-style iterative learning. Specifically, we find that three-head network can induce the following benefits: (1) learning can become faster as search takes advantage of the additional action-value head; (2) better prediction results than two-head architecture can be achieved when using additional action-value learning as an auxiliary task.
10	Informed and robust decision making in the face of uncertainty is critical for robots that perform physical tasks alongside people. We formulate this as a Bayesian Reinforcement Learning problem over latent Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While Bayes-optimality is theoretically the gold standard, existing algorithms do not scale well to continuous state and action spaces. We propose a scalable solution that builds on the following insight: in the absence of uncertainty, each latent MDP is easier to solve. We split the challenge into two simpler components. First, we obtain an ensemble of clairvoyant experts and fuse their advice to compute a baseline policy. Second, we train a Bayesian residual policy to improve upon the ensemble's recommendation and learn to reduce uncertainty. Our algorithm, Bayesian Residual Policy Optimization (BRPO), imports the scalability of policy gradient methods as well as the initialization from prior models. BRPO significantly improves the ensemble of experts and drastically outperforms existing adaptive RL methods.
10	Deep generative models such as Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) play an increasingly important role in machine learning and computer vision. However, there are two fundamental issues hindering their real-world applications: the difficulty of conducting variational inference in VAE and the functional absence of encoding real-world samples in GAN. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA) to address the above two issues in one framework. An invertible network and its inverse mapping are symmetrically embedded in the latent space of VAE. Thus the partial encoder first transforms the input into feature vectors and then the distribution of these feature vectors is reshaped to fit a prior by the invertible network. The decoder proceeds in the reverse order of the encoder's composite mappings. A two-stage stochasticity-free training scheme is designed to train LIA via adversarial learning, in the sense that the decoder of LIA is first trained as a standard GAN with the invertible network and then the partial encoder is learned from an autoencoder by detaching the invertible network from LIA.  Experiments conducted on the FFHQ face dataset and three LSUN datasets validate the effectiveness of LIA for inference and generation.
10	Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) assigns labels to initially unlabelled vertices in a graph.Graph neural networks (GNNs), esp. graph convolutional networks (GCNs), inspired the current-state-of-the art models for graph-based SSL problems.GCNs inherently assume that the labels of interest are numerical or categorical variables.However, in many real-world applications such as co-authorship networks, recommendation networks, etc., vertex labels can be naturally represented by probability distributions or histograms.Moreover, real-world network datasets have complex relationships going beyond pairwise associations.These relationships can be modelled naturally and flexibly by hypergraphs.In this paper, we explore GNNs for graph-based SSL of histograms.Motivated by complex relationships (those going beyond pairwise) in real-world networks, we propose a novel method for directed hypergraphs.Our work builds upon existing works on graph-based SSL of histograms derived from the theory of optimal transportation.A key contribution of this paper is to establish generalisation error bounds for a one-layer GNN within the framework of algorithmic stability.We also demonstrate our proposed methods' effectiveness through detailed experimentation on real-world data.We have made the code available.
10	A key difference from existing works is that our equivarification method can be applied without knowledge of the detailed functions of a layer in a neural network, and hence, can be generalized to any feedforward neural networks. Although the network size scales up, the constructed equivariant neural network does not increase the complexity of the network compared with the original one, in terms of the number of parameters. As an illustration, we build an equivariant neural network for image classification by equivarifying a convolutional neural network. Results show that our proposed method significantly reduces the design and training complexity, yet preserving the learning performance in terms of accuracy.
10	As deep CNN classifier performance using ground-truth labels has begun to asymptote at near-perfect levels, a key aim for the field is to extend training paradigms to capture further useful structure in natural image data and improve model robustness and generalization. In this paper, we present a novel natural image benchmark for making this extension, which we call CIFAR10H. This new dataset comprises a human-derived, full distribution over labels for each image of the CIFAR10 test set, offering the ability to assess the generalization of state-of-the-art CIFAR10 models, as well as investigate the effects of including this information in model training. We show that classification models trained on CIFAR10 do not generalize as well to our dataset as it does to traditional extensions, and that models fine-tuned using our label information are able to generalize better to related datasets, complement popular data augmentation schemes, and provide robustness to adversarial attacks. We explain these improvements in terms of better empirical approximations to the expected loss function over natural images and their categories in the visual world.
01	"Researches on deep neural networks with discrete parameters and their deployment in embedded systems have been active and promising topics. Although previous works have successfully reduced precision in inference, transferring both training and inference processes to low-bitwidth integers has not been demonstrated simultaneously. In this work, we develop a new method termed as ``""WAGE"" to discretize both training and inference, where weights (W), activations (A), gradients (G) and errors (E) among layers are shifted and linearly constrained to low-bitwidth integers. To perform pure discrete dataflow for fixed-point devices, we further replace batch normalization by a constant scaling layer and simplify other components that are arduous for integer implementation. Improved accuracies can be obtained on multiple datasets, which indicates that WAGE somehow acts as a type of regularization. Empirically, we demonstrate the potential to deploy training in hardware systems such as integer-based deep learning accelerators and neuromorphic chips with comparable accuracy and higher energy efficiency, which is crucial to future AI applications in variable scenarios with transfer and continual learning demands."
10	Batch Normalization (BN) is a well-known technique used in training deep neural networks.    The main idea behind batch normalization is to normalize the features of the layers ($i.e.$, transforming them to have a mean equal to zero and a variance equal to one).    Such a procedure encourages the optimization landscape of the loss function to be smoother, and improve the learning of the networks for both speed and performance.    In this paper,    we demonstrate that the performance of the network can be improved,    if the distributions of the features of the output in the same layer are similar.    As normalizing based on mean and variance does not necessarily make the features to have the same distribution, we propose a new normalization scheme: Batch Normalization with Skewness Reduction (BNSR).    Comparing with other normalization approaches,    BNSR transforms not just only the mean and variance,    but also the skewness of the data.    By tackling this property of a distribution, we are able to make the output distributions of the layers to be further similar. The nonlinearity of BNSR may further improve the expressiveness of the underlying network.    Comparisons with other normalization schemes are tested on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can outperform other state-of-the-arts that are not equipped with BNSR.
01	Multi-task learning (MTL) with neural networks leverages commonalities in tasks to improve performance, but often suffers from task interference which reduces the benefits of transfer. To address this issue we introduce the routing network paradigm, a novel neural network and training algorithm. A routing network is a kind of self-organizing neural network consisting of two components: a router and a set of one or more function blocks. A function block may be any neural network – for example a fully-connected or a convolutional layer. Given an input the router makes a routing decision, choosing a function block to apply and passing the output back to the router recursively, terminating when a fixed recursion depth is reached. In this way the routing network dynamically composes different function blocks for each input. We employ a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to jointly train the router and function blocks. We evaluate our model against cross-stitch networks and shared-layer baselines on multi-task settings of the MNIST, mini-imagenet, and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy, with sharper convergence. In addition, routing networks have nearly constant per-task training cost while cross-stitch networks scale linearly with the number of tasks. On CIFAR100 (20 tasks) we obtain cross-stitch performance levels with an 85% average reduction in training time.
10	"Revealing latent structure in data is an active field of research, having introduced exciting technologies such as variational autoencoders and adversarial networks, and is essential to push machine learning towards unsupervised knowledge discovery. However, a major challenge is the lack of suitable benchmarks for an objective and quantitative evaluation of learned representations. To address this issue we introduce Morpho-MNIST, a framework that aims to answer: ""to what extent has my model learned to represent specific factors of variation in the data?"" We extend the popular MNIST dataset by adding a morphometric analysis enabling quantitative comparison of trained models, identification of the roles of latent variables, and characterisation of sample diversity. We further propose a set of quantifiable perturbations to assess the performance of unsupervised and supervised methods on challenging tasks such as outlier detection and domain adaptation."
10	We extend the idea of word pieces in natural language models to machine learning tasks on opaque ids. This is achieved by applying hash functions to map each id to multiple hash tokens in a much smaller space, similarly to a Bloom filter. We show that by applying a multi-layer Transformer to these Bloom filter digests, we are able to obtain models with high accuracy. They outperform models of a similar size without hashing and, to a large degree, models of a much larger size trained using sampled softmax with the same computational budget. Our key observation is that it is important to use a multi-layer Transformer for Bloom filter digests to remove ambiguity in the hashed input. We believe this provides an alternative method to solving problems with large vocabulary size.
10	In deep learning, performance is strongly affected by the choice of architectureand hyperparameters. While there has been extensive work on automatic hyperpa-rameter optimization for simple spaces, complex spaces such as the space of deeparchitectures remain largely unexplored. As a result, the choice of architecture isdone manually by the human expert through a slow trial and error process guidedmainly by intuition. In this paper we describe a framework for automaticallydesigning and training deep models. We propose an extensible and modular lan-guage that allows the human expert to compactly represent complex search spacesover architectures and their hyperparameters. The resulting search spaces are tree-structured and therefore easy to traverse. Models can be automatically compiled tocomputational graphs once values for all hyperparameters have been chosen. Wecan leverage the structure of the search space to introduce different model searchalgorithms, such as random search, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), and sequen-tial model-based optimization (SMBO). We present experiments comparing thedifferent algorithms on CIFAR-10 and show that MCTS and SMBO outperformrandom search. We also present experiments on MNIST, showing that the samesearch space achieves near state-of-the-art performance with a few samples. Theseexperiments show that our framework can be used effectively for model discov-ery, as it is possible to describe expressive search spaces and discover competitivemodels without much effort from the human expert. Code for our framework andexperiments has been made publicly available
10	Loss functions play a pivotal role in deep metric learning (DML). A large variety of loss functions have been proposed in DML recently. However, it remains difficult to answer this question: what are the intrinsic differences among these loss functions?This paper answers this question by proposing a unified perspective to rethink deep metric loss functions. We show theoretically that most DML methods in deep metric learning, in view of  gradient equivalence, are essentially weight assignment strategies of training pairs. Based on this unified view, we revisit several typical DML methods and disclose their hidden drawbacks. Moreover, we point out the key components of an effective DML approach which drives us to propose our weight assignment framework. We evaluate our method on image retrieval tasks, and show that it outperforms  the state-of-the-art DML approaches by a significant margin on the CUB-200-2011, Cars-196, Stanford Online Products and In-Shop Clothes Retrieval datasets. 
10	Existing Lipschitz-based provable defences to adversarial examples only cover the L2 threat model. We introduce the first bound that makes use of Lipschitz continuity to provide a more general guarantee for threat models based on any p-norm. Additionally, a new strategy is proposed for designing network architectures that exhibit superior provable adversarial robustness over conventional convolutional neural networks. Experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical contributions, show that the assumptions made during the design of our novel architecture hold in practice, and quantify the empirical robustness of several Lipschitz-based adversarial defence methods.
10	The goal of imitation learning (IL) is to learn a good policy from high-quality demonstrations. However, the quality of demonstrations in reality can be diverse, since it is easier and cheaper to collect demonstrations from a mix of experts and amateurs. IL in such situations can be challenging, especially when the level of demonstrators' expertise is unknown. We propose a new IL paradigm called Variational Imitation Learning with Diverse-quality demonstrations (VILD), where we explicitly model the level of demonstrators' expertise with a probabilistic graphical model and estimate it along with a reward function. We show that a naive estimation approach is not suitable to large state and action spaces, and fix this issue by using a variational approach that can be easily implemented using existing reinforcement learning methods. Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that VILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work enables scalable and data-efficient IL under more realistic settings than before.
10	In this paper we develop an approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address dynamic pricing problem on E-commerce platform. We models  real-world E-commerce dynamic pricing problem as Markov Decision Process. Environment state are defined with four groups of different business data. We make several main improvements on the state-of-the-art DRL-based dynamic pricing approaches: 1. We first extend the application of dynamic pricing to a continuous pricing action space. 2. We solve the unknown demand function problem by designing different reward functions. 3. The cold-start problem is addressed by introducing pre-training and evaluation using the historical sales data. Field experiments are designed and conducted on real-world E-commerce platform, pricing thousands of SKUs of products lasting for months. The experiment results shows that, on E-commerce platform, the difference of the revenue conversion rates (DRCR) is a more suitable reward function than the revenue only, which is different from  the conclusion from previous researches. Meanwhile, the proposed continuous action model performs better than the discrete one.
10	Text embedding representing natural language documents in a semantic vector space can be used for document retrieval using nearest neighbor lookup. In order to study the feasibility of neural models specialized for retrieval in a semantically meaningful way, we suggest the use of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) in an open-domain question answering context, where the first task is to find paragraphs useful for answering a given question. First, we compare the quality of various text-embedding methods on the performance of retrieval and give an extensive empirical comparison on the performance of various non-augmented base embedding with, and without IDF weighting. Our main results are that by training deep residual neural models specifically for retrieval purposes can yield significant gains when it is used to augment existing embeddings. We also establish that deeper models are superior to this task. The best base baseline embeddings augmented by our learned neural approach improves the top-1 recall of the system by 14% in terms of the question side, and by 8% in terms of the paragraph side.
01	The ability to decompose complex multi-object scenes into meaningful abstractions like objects is fundamental to achieve higher-level cognition. Previous approaches for unsupervised object-oriented scene representation learning are either based on spatial-attention or scene-mixture approaches and limited in scalability which is a main obstacle towards modeling real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose a generative latent variable model, called SPACE, that provides a uniﬁed probabilistic modeling framework that combines the best of spatial-attention and scene-mixture approaches. SPACE can explicitly provide factorized object representations for foreground objects while also decomposing background segments of complex morphology. Previous models are good at either of these, but not both. SPACE also resolves the scalability problems of previous methods by incorporating parallel spatial-attention and thus is applicable to scenes with a large number of objects without performance degradations. We show through experiments on Atari and 3D-Rooms that SPACE achieves the above properties consistently in comparison to SPAIR, IODINE, and GENESIS. Results of our experiments can be found on our project website: https://sites.google.com/view/space-project-page
10	Automatic search of neural network architectures is a standing research topic. In addition to the fact that it presents a faster alternative to hand-designed architectures, it can improve their efficiency and for instance generate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) adapted for mobile devices. In this paper, we present a multi-objective neural architecture search method to find a family of CNN models with the best accuracy and computational resources tradeoffs, in a search space inspired by the state-of-the-art findings in neural search. Our work, called Dvolver, evolves a population of architectures and iteratively improves an approximation of the optimal Pareto front. Applying Dvolver on the model accuracy and on the number of floating points operations as objective functions, we are able to find, in only 2.5 days 1 , a set of competitive mobile models on ImageNet. Amongst these models one architecture has the same Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet as NASNet-A mobile with 8% less floating point operations and another one has a Top-1 accuracy of 75.28% on ImageNet exceeding by 0.28% the best MobileNetV2 model for the same computational resources.
01	Recent theoretical work has established connections between over-parametrized neural networks and linearized models governed by the Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs). NTK theory leads to concrete convergence and generalization results, yet the empirical performance of neural networks are observed to exceed their linearized models, suggesting insufficiency of this theory.Towards closing this gap, we investigate the training of over-parametrized neural networks that are beyond the NTK regime yet still governed by the Taylor expansion of the network. We bring forward the idea of randomizing the neural networks, which allows them to escape their NTK and couple with quadratic models. We show that the optimization landscape of randomized two-layer networks are nice and amenable to escaping-saddle algorithms. We prove concrete generalization and expressivity results on these randomized networks, which lead to sample complexity bounds (of learning certain simple functions) that match the NTK and can in addition be better by a dimension factor when mild distributional assumptions are present. We demonstrate that our randomization technique can be generalized systematically beyond the quadratic case, by using it to find networks that are coupled with higher-order terms in their Taylor series.
10	Dialogue systems require a great deal of different but complementary expertise to assist, inform, and entertain humans. For example, different domains (e.g., restaurant reservation, train ticket booking) of goal-oriented dialogue systems can be viewed as different skills, and so does ordinary chatting abilities of chit-chat dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose to learn a dialogue system that independently parameterizes different dialogue skills, and learns to select and combine each of them through Attention over Parameters (AoP). The experimental results show that this approach achieves competitive performance on a combined dataset of MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al., 2018), In-Car Assistant (Eric et al.,2017), and Persona-Chat (Zhang et al., 2018). Finally, we demonstrate that each dialogue skill is effectively learned and can be combined with other skills to produce selective responses. 
01	Many real world tasks exhibit rich structure that is repeated across different parts of the state space or in time. In this work we study the possibility of leveraging such repeated structure to speed up and regularize learning. We start from the KL regularized expected reward objective which introduces an additional component, a default policy. Instead of relying on a fixed default policy, we learn it from data. But crucially, we restrict the amount of information the default policy receives, forcing it to learn reusable behaviors that help the policy learn faster. We formalize this strategy and discuss connections to information bottleneck approaches and to the variational EM algorithm. We present empirical results in both discrete and continuous action domains and demonstrate that, for certain tasks, learning a default policy alongside the policy can significantly speed up and improve learning.Please watch the video demonstrating learned experts and default policies on several continuous control tasks ( https://youtu.be/U2qA3llzus8 ).
10	Data parallelism has become a dominant method to scale Deep Neural Network (DNN) training across multiple nodes.  Since the synchronization of the local models or gradients can be a bottleneck for large-scale distributed training, compressing communication traffic has gained widespread attention recently.  Among several recent proposed compression algorithms, Residual Gradient Compression (RGC) is one of the most successful approaches---it can significantly compress the transmitting message size (0.1% of the gradient size) of each node and still preserve accuracy. However, the literature on compressing deep networks focuses almost exclusively on achieving good compression rate, while the efficiency of RGC in real implementation has been less investigated. In this paper, we develop an RGC method that achieves significant training time improvement in real-world multi-GPU systems. Our proposed RGC system design called RedSync, introduces a set of optimizations to reduce communication bandwidth while introducing limited overhead. We examine the performance of RedSync on two different multiple GPU platforms, including a supercomputer and a multi-card server. Our test cases include image classification on Cifar10 and ImageNet, and language modeling tasks on Penn Treebank and Wiki2 datasets. For DNNs featured with high communication to computation ratio, which has long been considered with poor scalability, RedSync shows significant performance improvement.
10	Naively applying Reinforcement Learning algorithms to continuous control problems -- such as locomotion and robot control -- to maximize task reward often results in policies which rely on high-amplitude, high-frequency control signals, known colloquially as bang-bang control. While such policies can implement the optimal solution, particularly in simulated systems, they are often not desirable for real world systems since bang-bang control can lead to increased wear and tear and energy consumption and tends to excite undesired second-order dynamics. To counteract this issue, multi-objective optimization can be used to simultaneously optimize both the reward and some auxiliary cost that discourages undesired (e.g. high-amplitude) control. In principle, such an approach can yield the sought after, smooth, control policies. It can, however, be hard to find the correct trade-off between cost and return that results in the desired behavior. In this paper we propose a new constraint-based approach which defines a lower bound on the return while minimizing one or more costs (such as control effort). We employ Lagrangian relaxation to learn both (a) the parameters of a control policy that satisfies the desired constraints and (b) the Lagrangian multipliers for the optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate policy optimization which satisfies constraints either in expectation or in a per-step fashion, and we learn a single conditional policy that is able to dynamically change the trade-off between return and cost. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach using a number of continuous control benchmark tasks as well as a realistic, energy-optimized quadruped locomotion task.
01	We study the problem of model extraction in natural language processing, in which an adversary with only query access to a victim model attempts to reconstruct a local copy of that model. Assuming that both the adversary and victim model fine-tune a large pretrained language model such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), we show that the adversary does not need any real training data to successfully mount the attack. In fact, the attacker need not even use grammatical or semantically meaningful queries: we show that random sequences of words coupled with task-specific heuristics form effective queries for model extraction on a diverse set of NLP tasks, including natural language inference and question answering. Our work thus highlights an exploit only made feasible by the shift towards transfer learning methods within the NLP community: for a query budget of a few hundred dollars, an attacker can extract a model that performs only slightly worse than the victim model. Finally, we study two defense strategies against model extraction—membership classification and API watermarking—which while successful against some adversaries can also be circumvented by more clever ones.
10	Many imaging tasks require global information about all pixels in an image. Conventional bottom-up classification networks globalize information by decreasing resolution; features are pooled and down-sampled into a single output. But for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks, a network must provide higher-resolution pixel-level outputs. To globalize information while preserving resolution, many researchers propose the inclusion of sophisticated auxiliary blocks, but these come at the cost of a considerable increase in network size and computational cost. This paper proposes stacked u-nets (SUNets), which iteratively combine features from different resolution scales while maintaining resolution. SUNets leverage the information globalization power of u-nets in a deeper net- work architectures that is capable of handling the complexity of natural images. SUNets perform extremely well on semantic segmentation tasks using a small number of parameters.
01	Summarization of long sequences into a concise statement is a core problem in natural language processing, requiring non-trivial understanding of the input. Based on the promising results of graph neural networks on highly structured data, we develop a framework to extend existing sequence encoders with a graph component that can reason about long-distance relationships in weakly structured data such as text. In an extensive evaluation, we show that the resulting hybrid sequence-graph models outperform both pure sequence models as well as pure graph models on a range of summarization tasks.
10	Knowledge distillation is a potential solution for model compression. The idea is to make a small student network imitate the target of a large teacher network, then the student network can be competitive to the teacher one. Most previous studies focus on model distillation in the classification task, where they propose different architectures and initializations for the student network. However, only the classification task is not enough, and other related tasks such as regression and retrieval are barely considered. To solve the problem, in this paper, we take face recognition as a breaking point and propose model distillation with knowledge transfer from face classification to alignment and verification. By selecting appropriate initializations and targets in the knowledge transfer, the distillation can be easier in non-classification tasks. Experiments on the CelebA and CASIA-WebFace datasets demonstrate that the student network can be competitive to the teacher one in alignment and verification, and even surpasses the teacher network under specific compression rates. In addition, to achieve stronger knowledge transfer, we also use a common initialization trick to improve the distillation performance of classification. Evaluations on the CASIA-Webface and large-scale MS-Celeb-1M datasets show the effectiveness of this simple trick.
01	We present a deep reinforcement learning approach to minimizing the execution cost of neural network computation graphs in an optimizing compiler. Unlike earlier learning-based works that require training the optimizer on the same graph to be optimized, we propose a learning approach that trains an optimizer offline and then generalizes to previously unseen graphs without further training. This allows our approach to produce high-quality execution decisions on real-world TensorFlow graphs in seconds instead of hours. We consider two optimization tasks for computation graphs: minimizing running time and peak memory usage. In comparison to an extensive set of baselines, our approach achieves significant improvements over classical and other learning-based methods on these two tasks. 
10	Hierarchical Sparse Coding (HSC) is a powerful model to efficiently represent multi-dimensional, structured data such as images. The simplest solution to solve this computationally hard problem is to decompose it into independent layerwise subproblems. However, neuroscientific evidence would suggest inter-connecting these subproblems as in the Predictive Coding (PC) theory, which adds top-down connections between consecutive layers. In this study, a new model called Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC) is introduced to assess the impact of this inter-layer feedback connection. In particular, the SDPC is compared with a Hierarchical Lasso (Hi-La) network made out of a sequence of Lasso layers. A 2-layered SDPC and a Hi-La networks are trained on 3 different databases and with different sparsity parameters on each layer. First, we show that the overall prediction error generated by SDPC is lower thanks to the feedback mechanism as it transfers prediction error between layers. Second, we demonstrate that the inference stage of the SDPC is faster to converge than for the Hi-La model. Third, we show that the SDPC also accelerates the learning process. Finally, the qualitative analysis of both models dictionaries, supported by their activation probability, show that the SDPC features are more generic and informative.
10	Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown promising performance in computer vision. In medical imaging, encouraging results have been achieved with deep learning for applications such as segmentation, lesion detection and classification. Nearly all of the deep learning based image analysis methods work on reconstructed images, which are obtained from original acquisitions via solving inverse problems (reconstruction). The reconstruction algorithms are designed for human observers, but not necessarily optimized for DNNs which can often observe features that are incomprehensible for human eyes. Hence, it is desirable to train the DNNs directly from the original data which lie in a different domain with the images. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end DNN for abnormality detection in medical imaging. To align the acquisition with the annotations made by radiologists in the image domain, a DNN was built as the unrolled version of iterative reconstruction algorithms to map the acquisitions to images, and followed by a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the abnormality in the reconstructed images. The two networks were trained jointly in order to optimize the entire DNN for the detection task from the original acquisitions. The DNN was implemented for lung nodule detection in low-dose chest computed tomography (CT), where a numerical simulation was done to generate acquisitions from 1,018 chest CT images with radiologists' annotations. The proposed end-to-end DNN demonstrated better sensitivity and accuracy for the task compared to a two-step approach, in which the reconstruction and detection DNNs were trained separately. A significant reduction of false positive rate on suspicious lesions were observed, which is crucial for the known over-diagnosis in low-dose lung CT imaging. The images reconstructed by the proposed end-to-end network also presented enhanced details in the region of interest. 
01	This paper introduces a network architecture to solve the structure-from-motion (SfM) problem via feature-metric bundle adjustment (BA), which explicitly enforces multi-view geometry constraints in the form of feature-metric error. The whole pipeline is differentiable, so that the network can learn suitable features that make the BA problem more tractable. Furthermore, this work introduces a novel depth parameterization to recover dense per-pixel depth. The network first generates several basis depth maps according to the input image, and optimizes the final depth as a linear combination of these basis depth maps via feature-metric BA. The basis depth maps generator is also learned via end-to-end training. The whole system nicely combines domain knowledge (i.e. hard-coded multi-view geometry constraints) and deep learning (i.e. feature learning and basis depth maps learning) to address the challenging dense SfM problem. Experiments on large scale real data prove the success of the proposed method.
10	Adversarial perturbations cause a shift in the salient features of an image, which may result in a misclassification. We demonstrate that gradient-based saliency approaches are unable to capture this shift, and develop a new defense which detects adversarial examples based on learnt saliency models instead. We study two approaches: a CNN trained to distinguish between natural and adversarial images using the saliency masks produced by our learnt saliency model, and a CNN trained on the salient pixels themselves as its input. On MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ASSIRA, our defenses are able to detect various adversarial attacks, including strong attacks such as C&W and DeepFool, contrary to gradient-based saliency and detectors which rely on the input image. The latter are unable to detect adversarial images when the L_2- and L_infinity- norms of the perturbations are too small. Lastly, we find that the salient pixel based detector improves on saliency map based detectors as it is more robust to white-box attacks.
10	Control policies, trained using the Deep Reinforcement Learning, have been recently shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks introducing even very small perturbations to the policy input. The attacks proposed so far have been designed using heuristics, and build on existing adversarial example crafting techniques used to dupe classifiers in supervised learning. In contrast, this paper investigates the problem of devising optimal attacks, depending on a well-defined attacker's objective, e.g., to minimize the main agent average reward. When the policy and the system dynamics, as well as rewards, are known to the attacker, a scenario referred to as a white-box attack, designing optimal attacks amounts to solving a Markov Decision Process. For what we call black-box attacks, where neither the policy nor the system is known, optimal attacks can be trained using Reinforcement Learning techniques. Through  numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of our attacks compared to existing attacks (usually based on Gradient methods). We further quantify the potential impact of attacks and establish its connection to the smoothness of the policy under attack. Smooth policies are naturally less prone to attacks (this explains why Lipschitz policies, with respect to the state, are more resilient). Finally, we show that from the main agent perspective, the system uncertainties and the attacker can be modelled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We actually demonstrate that using Reinforcement Learning techniques tailored to POMDP (e.g. using Recurrent Neural Networks) leads to more resilient policies. 
01	The data stream model is a fundamental model for processing massive data sets with limited memory and fast processing time. Recently Hsu et al. (2019) incorporated machine learning techniques into the data stream model in order to learn relevant patterns in the input data. Such techniques were encapsulated by training an oracle to predict item frequencies in the streaming model. In this paper we explore the full power of such an oracle, showing that it can be applied to a wide array of problems in data streams, sometimes resulting in the first optimal bounds for such problems. Namely, we apply the oracle to counting distinct elements on the difference of streams, estimating frequency moments, estimating cascaded aggregates, and estimating moments of geometric data streams. For the distinct elements problem, we obtain the first memory-optimal algorithms. For estimating the $p$-th frequency moment for $0 < p < 2$ we obtain the first algorithms with optimal update time. For estimating the $p$-the frequency moment for $p > 2$ we obtain a quadratic saving in memory. We empirically validate our results, demonstrating also our improvements in practice. 
10	Training conditional generative latent-variable models is challenging in scenarios where the conditioning signal is very strong and the decoder is expressive enough to generate a plausible output given only the condition; the generative model tends to ignore the latent variable, suffering from posterior collapse.  We find, and empirically show, that one of the major reasons behind posterior collapse is rooted in the way that generative models are conditioned, i.e., through concatenation of the latent variable and the condition. To mitigate this problem, we propose to explicitly make the latent variables depend on the condition by unifying the conditioning and latent variable sampling, thus coupling them so as to prevent the model from discarding the root of variations. To achieve this, we develop a conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture that learns a distribution not only of the latent variables, but also of the condition, the latter acting as prior on the former. Our experiments on the challenging tasks of conditional human motion prediction and image captioning demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach at avoiding posterior collapse. Video results of our approach are anonymously provided in http://bit.ly/iclr2020
10	We propose a novel framework to generate clean video frames from a single motion-blurred image.While a broad range of literature focuses on recovering a single image from a blurred image, in this work, we tackle a more challenging task i.e.  video restoration from a blurred image. We formulate video restoration from a single blurred image as an inverse problem by setting clean image sequence and their respective motion as latent factors, and the blurred image as an observation. Our framework is based on an encoder-decoder structure with spatial transformer network modules to restore a video sequence and its underlying motion in an end-to-end manner. We design a loss function and regularizers with complementary properties to stabilize the training and analyze variant models of the proposed network. The effectiveness and transferability of our network are highlighted through a large set of experiments on two different types of datasets: camera rotation blurs generated from panorama scenes and dynamic motion blurs in high speed videos. Our code and models will be publicly available. 
10	Generative adversarial networks have achieved remarkable performance on various tasks but suffer from sensitivity to hyper-parameters, training instability, and mode collapse. We find that this is partly due to gradient given by non-robust discriminator containing non-informative adversarial noise, which can hinder generator from catching the pattern of real samples. Inspired by defense against adversarial samples, we introduce adversarial training of discriminator on real samples that does not exist in classic GANs framework to make adversarial training symmetric, which can balance min-max game and make discriminator more robust. Robust discriminator can give more informative gradient with less adversarial noise, which can stabilize training and accelerate convergence. We validate the proposed method on image generation tasks with varied network architectures quantitatively. Experiments show that training stability, perceptual quality, and diversity of generated samples are consistently improved with small additional training computation cost.
10	We introduce an analytic distance function for moderately sized point sets of known cardinality that is shown to have very desirable properties, both as a loss function as well as a regularizer for machine learning applications. We compare our novel construction to other point set distance functions and show proof of concept experiments for training neural networks end-to-end on point set prediction tasks such as object detection.
01	We present NeuroSAT, a message passing neural network that learns to solve SAT problems after only being trained as a classifier to predict satisfiability.  Although it is not competitive with state-of-the-art SAT solvers, NeuroSAT can solve problems that are substantially larger and more difficult than it ever saw during training by simply running for more iterations. Moreover, NeuroSAT generalizes to novel distributions; after training only on random SAT problems, at test time it can solve SAT problems encoding graph coloring, clique detection, dominating set, and vertex cover problems, all on a range of distributions over small random graphs.
10	Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method for reducing the computational over-head of deep network inference, in which the output of a teacher model is used to traina smaller, faster student model. Hint training (i.e., FitNets) extends KD by regressing astudent model’s intermediate representation to a teacher model’s intermediate representa-tion. In this work, we introduce bLock-wise Intermediate representation Training (LIT),a novel model compression technique that extends the use of intermediate represen-tations in deep network compression, outperforming KD and hint training. LIT has twokey ideas: 1) LIT trains a student of the same width (but shallower depth) as the teacherby directly comparing the intermediate representations, and 2) LIT uses the intermediaterepresentation from the previous block in the teacher model as an input to the current stu-dent block during training, avoiding unstable intermediate representations in the studentnetwork. We show that LIT provides substantial reductions in network depth withoutloss in accuracy — for example, LIT can compress a ResNeXt-110 to a ResNeXt-20(5.5×) on CIFAR10 and a VDCNN-29 to a VDCNN-9 (3.2×) on Amazon Reviewswithout loss in accuracy, outperforming KD and hint training in network size at a givenaccuracy. We also show that applying LIT to identical student/teacher architecturesincreases the accuracy of the student model above the teacher model, outperforming therecently-proposed Born Again Networks procedure on ResNet, ResNeXt, and VDCNN.Finally, we show that LIT can effectively compress GAN generators.
10	AI today is far from being able to write complex programs. What type of problemswould be best for computers to learn to program, and how should such problemsbe generated? To answer the first question, we suggest programming puzzles as adomain for teaching computers programming. A programming puzzle consists of ashort program for a Boolean function f(x) and the goal is, given the source code, tofind an input that makes f return True. Puzzles are objective in that one can easilytest the correctness of a given solution x by seeing whether it satisfies f, unlike themost common representations for program synthesis: given input-output pairs or anEnglish problem description, the correctness of a given solution is not determinedand is debatable. To address the second question of automatic puzzle generation,we suggest a GAN-like generation algorithm called “Troublemaker” which cangenerate puzzles targeted at any given puzzle-solver. The main innovation is that itadapts to one or more given puzzle-solvers: rather than generating a single datasetof puzzles, Tro
10	"There are myriad kinds of segmentation, and ultimately the `""right"" segmentation of a given scene is in the eye of the annotator. Standard approaches require large amounts of labeled data to learn just one particular kind of segmentation. As a first step towards relieving this annotation burden, we propose the problem of guided segmentation: given varying amounts of pixel-wise labels, segment unannotated pixels by propagating supervision locally (within an image) and non-locally (across images). We propose guided networks, which extract a latent task representation---guidance---from variable amounts and classes (categories, instances, etc.) of pixel supervision and optimize our architecture end-to-end for fast, accurate, and data-efficient segmentation by meta-learning. To span the few-shot and many-shot learning regimes, we examine guidance from as little as one pixel per concept to as much as 1000+ images, and compare to full gradient optimization at both extremes. To explore generalization, we analyze guidance as a bridge between different levels of supervision to segment classes as the union of instances. Our segmentor concentrates different amounts of supervision of different types of classes into an efficient latent representation, non-locally propagates this supervision across images, and can be updated quickly and cumulatively when given more supervision."
01	Learning tasks on source code (i.e., formal languages) have been considered recently, but most work has tried to transfer natural language methods and does not capitalize on the unique opportunities offered by code's known syntax. For example, long-range dependencies induced by using the same variable or function in distant locations are often not considered. We propose to use graphs to represent both the syntactic and semantic structure of code and use graph-based deep learning methods to learn to reason over program structures.In this work, we present how to construct graphs from source code and how to scale Gated Graph Neural Networks training to such large graphs. We evaluate our method on two tasks: VarNaming, in which a network attempts to predict the name of a variable given its usage, and VarMisuse, in which the network learns to reason about selecting the correct variable that should be used at a given program location. Our comparison to methods that use less structured program representations shows the advantages of modeling known structure, and suggests that our models learn to infer meaningful names and to solve the VarMisuse task in many cases. Additionally, our testing showed that VarMisuse identifies a number of bugs in mature open-source projects.
10	Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a common method for transferring the ``knowledge'' learned by one machine learning model (the teacher) into another model (the student), where typically, the teacher has a greater capacity (e.g., more parameters or higher bit-widths). To our knowledge, existing methods overlook the fact that although the student absorbs extra knowledge from the teacher, both models share the same input data -- and this data is the only medium by which the teacher's knowledge can be demonstrated. Due to the difference in model capacities, the student may not benefit fully from the same data points on which the teacher is trained. On the other hand, a human teacher may demonstrate a piece of knowledge with individualized examples adapted to a particular student, for instance, in terms of her cultural background and interests. Inspired by this behavior, we design data augmentation agents with distinct roles to facilitate knowledge distillation. Our data augmentation agents generate distinct training data for the teacher and student, respectively. We focus specifically on KD when the teacher network has greater precision (bit-width) than the student network.We find empirically that specially tailored data points enable the teacher's knowledge to be demonstrated more effectively to the student. We compare our approach with existing KD methods on training popular neural architectures and demonstrate that role-wise data augmentation improves the effectiveness of KD over strong prior approaches. The code for reproducing our results will be made publicly available.
10	Automatic classification of objects is one of the most important tasks in engineeringand data mining applications. Although using more complex and advancedclassifiers can help to improve the accuracy of classification systems, it can bedone by analyzing data sets and their features for a particular problem. Featurecombination is the one which can improve the quality of the features. In this paper,a structure similar to Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) is used to generate anoptimized linear or non-linear combination of features for classification. GeneticAlgorithm (GA) is applied to update weights and biases. Since nature of data setsand their features impact on the effectiveness of combination and classificationsystem, linear and non-linear activation functions (or transfer function) are usedto achieve more reliable system. Experiments of several UCI data sets and usingminimum distance classifier as a simple classifier indicate that proposed linear andnon-linear intelligent FFNN-based feature combination can present more reliableand promising results. By using such a feature combination method, there is noneed to use more powerful and complex classifier anymore.
10	Deep reinforcement learning has obtained significant breakthroughs in recent years. Most methods in deep-RL achieve good results via the maximization of the reward signal provided by the environment, typically in the form of discounted cumulative returns. Such reward signals represent the immediate feedback of a particular action performed by an agent. However, tasks with sparse reward signals are still challenging to on-policy methods. In this paper, we introduce an effective characterization of past reward statistics (which can be seen as long-term feedback signals) to supplement this immediate reward feedback. In particular, value functions are learned with multi-critics supervision, enabling complex value functions to be more easily approximated in on-policy learning, even when the reward signals are sparse. We also introduce a novel exploration mechanism called ``hot-wiring'' that can give a boost to seemingly trapped agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our advantage actor multi-critic (A2MC) method across the discrete domains in Atari games as well as continuous domains in the MuJoCo environments. A video demo is provided at https://youtu.be/zBmpf3Yz8tc and source codes will be made available upon paper acceptance.
01	Training neural networks on large datasets can be accelerated by distributing the workload over a network of machines. As datasets grow ever larger, networks of hundreds or thousands of machines become economically viable. The time cost of communicating gradients limits the effectiveness of using such large machine counts, as may the increased chance of network faults. We explore a particularly simple algorithm for robust, communication-efficient learning---signSGD. Workers transmit only the sign of their gradient vector to a server, and the overall update is decided by a majority vote. This algorithm uses 32x less communication per iteration than full-precision, distributed SGD. Under natural conditions verified by experiment, we prove that signSGD converges in the large and mini-batch settings, establishing convergence for a parameter regime of Adam as a byproduct. Aggregating sign gradients by majority vote means that no individual worker has too much power. We prove that unlike SGD, majority vote is robust when up to 50% of workers behave adversarially. The class of adversaries we consider includes as special cases those that invert or randomise their gradient estimate. On the practical side, we built our distributed training system in Pytorch. Benchmarking against the state of the art collective communications library (NCCL), our framework---with the parameter server housed entirely on one machine---led to a 25% reduction in time for training resnet50 on Imagenet when using 15 AWS p3.2xlarge machines.
10	This paper presents a method to explain how input information is discarded through intermediate layers of a neural network during the forward propagation. The layerwise analysis of information discarding is used to explain and diagnose various deep-learning techniques. We define two types of entropy-based metrics, i.e., the strict information discarding and the reconstruction uncertainty, which measure input information of a specific layer from two perspectives. We develop a method to compute entropy-based metrics, which ensures the fairness of comparisons between different layers of different networks. Preliminary experiments have shown the effectiveness of our metrics in analyzing benchmark networks and explaining existing deep-learning techniques. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.
10	We investigate neural network training and generalization using the concept of stiffness. We measure how stiff a network is by looking at how a small gradient step on one example affects the loss on another example. In particular, we study how stiffness depends on 1) class membership, 2) distance between data points in the input space, 3) training iteration, and 4) learning rate. We experiment on MNIST, FASHION MNIST, and CIFAR-10 using fully-connected and convolutional neural networks. Our results demonstrate that stiffness is a useful concept for diagnosing and characterizing generalization. We observe that small learning rates reliably lead to higher stiffness at a given epoch as well as at a given training loss. In addition, we measure how stiffness between two data points depends on their mutual input-space distance, and establish the concept of a dynamical critical length that characterizes the distance over which datapoints react similarly to gradient updates. The dynamical critical length decreases with training and the higher the learning rate, the smaller the critical length.
10	Stemming from neuroscience, Spiking neural networks (SNNs), a brain-inspired neural network that is a versatile solution to fault-tolerant and energy efficient information processing pertains to the ”event-driven” characteristic as the analogy of the behavior of biological neurons. However, they are inferior to artificial neural networks (ANNs) in real complicated tasks and only had it been achieved good results in rather simple applications. When ANNs usually being questioned about it expensive processing costs and lack of essential biological plausibility, the temporal characteristic of RNN-based architecture makes it suitable to incorporate SNN inside as imitating the transition of membrane potential through time, and a brain-inspired Recurrent Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (RLIF) model has been put forward to overcome a series of challenges, such as discrete binary output and dynamical trait. The experiment results show that our recurrent architecture has an ultra anti-interference ability and strictly follows the guideline of SNN that spike output through it is discrete. Furthermore, this architecture achieves a good result on neuromorphic datasets and can be extended to tasks like text summarization and video understanding.
01	We hypothesize that curiosity is a mechanism found by evolution that encourages meaningful exploration early in an agent's life in order to expose it to experiences that enable it to obtain high rewards over the course of its lifetime. We formulate the problem of generating curious behavior as one of meta-learning: an outer loop will search over a space of curiosity mechanisms that dynamically adapt the agent's reward signal, and an inner loop will perform standard reinforcement learning using the adapted reward signal. However, current meta-RL methods based on transferring neural network weights have only generalized between very similar tasks. To broaden the generalization, we instead propose to meta-learn algorithms: pieces of code similar to those designed by humans in ML papers. Our rich language of programs combines neural networks with other building blocks such as buffers, nearest-neighbor modules and custom loss functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach empirically, finding two novel curiosity algorithms that perform on par or better than human-designed published curiosity algorithms in domains as disparate as grid navigation with image inputs, acrobot, lunar lander, ant and hopper.
10	Understanding theoretical properties of deep and locally connected nonlinear network, such as deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), is still a hard problem despite its empirical success. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical framework for such networks with ReLU nonlinearity. The framework bridges data distribution with gradient descent rules, favors disentangled representations and is compatible with common regularization techniques such as Batch Norm, after a novel discovery of its projection nature. The framework is built upon teacher-student setting, by projecting the student's forward/backward pass onto the teacher's computational graph. We do not impose unrealistic assumptions (e.g., Gaussian inputs, independence of activation, etc). Our framework could help facilitate theoretical analysis of many practical issues, e.g. disentangled representations in deep networks. 
10	In this paper, a new interactive parallel learning scheme is proposed to enhance the performance of off-policy continuous-action reinforcement learning.  In the proposed interactive parallel learning scheme, multiple identical learners with their own value-functions and policies share a common experience replay buffer, and search a good policy in collaboration with the guidance of the best policy information. The information of the best policy  is fused in a soft manner by constructing an augmented loss function for policy update to enlarge the overall search space by the multiple learners. The guidance by the previous best policy and the enlarged search space by the proposed interactive parallel learning scheme enable faster and better policy search in the policy parameter space. Working algorithms are constructed by  applying the proposed interactive parallel learning scheme to several off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms such as  the twin delayed deep deterministic (TD3) policy gradient algorithm and the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, and numerical results show that the constructed IPE-enhanced algorithms outperform most of the current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous action control.
01	Neural text generation is a key tool in natural language applications, but it is well known there are major problems at its core. In particular, standard likelihood training and decoding leads to dull and repetitive outputs. While some post-hoc fixes have been proposed, in particular top-k and nucleus sampling, they do not address the fact that the token-level probabilities predicted by the model are poor. In this paper we show that the likelihood objective itself is at fault, resulting in a model that assigns too much probability to sequences containing repeats and frequent words, unlike those from the human training distribution. We propose a new objective, unlikelihood training, which forces unlikely generations to be assigned lower probability by the model. We show that both token and sequence level unlikelihood training give less repetitive, less dull text while maintaining perplexity, giving superior generations using standard greedy or beam search. According to human evaluations, our approach with standard beam search also outperforms the currently popular decoding methods of nucleus sampling or beam blocking, thus providing a strong alternative to existing techniques.
10	Meta-learning methods, most notably Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (Finn et al, 2017) or MAML, have achieved great success in adapting to new tasks quickly, after having been trained on similar tasks.The mechanism behind their success, however, is poorly understood.We begin this work with an experimental analysis of MAML, finding that deep models are crucial for its success, even given sets of simple tasks where a linear model would suffice on any individual task.Furthermore, on image-recognition tasks, we find that the early layers of MAML-trained models learn task-invariant features, while later layers are used for adaptation, providing further evidence that these models require greater capacity than is strictly necessary for their individual tasks.Following our findings, we propose a method which enables better use of model capacity at inference time by separating the adaptation aspect of meta-learning into parameters that are only used for adaptation but are not part of the forward model.We find that our approach enables more effective meta-learning in smaller models, which are suitably sized for the individual tasks.
10	In this paper, we present a system that is capable of generating long polyphonic music given number of measures, up to hundreds of measures. This is achieved by creating a measure model that imitates the object hierarchy used in  common encodings of traditional western music notation.On top of this, we construct a inter-measure context model that spans the entire composition. 
10	We propose to improve trust region policy search with normalizing flows policy. We illustrate that when the trust region is constructed by KL divergence constraint, normalizing flows policy can generate samples far from the 'center' of the previous policy iterate, which potentially enables better exploration and helps avoid bad local optima. We show that normalizing flows policy significantly improves upon factorized Gaussian policy baseline, with both TRPO and ACKTR, especially on tasks with complex dynamics such as Humanoid.
01	A generally intelligent learner should generalize to more complex tasks than it has previously encountered, but the two common paradigms in machine learning -- either training a separate learner per task or training a single learner for all tasks -- both have difficulty with such generalization because they do not leverage  the compositional structure of the task distribution. This paper introduces the compositional problem graph as a broadly applicable formalism to relate tasks of different complexity in terms of problems with shared subproblems. We propose the compositional generalization problem for measuring how readily old knowledge can be reused and hence built upon. As a first step for tackling compositional generalization, we introduce the compositional recursive learner, a domain-general framework for learning algorithmic procedures for composing representation transformations, producing a learner that reasons about what computation to execute by making analogies to previously seen problems. We show on a symbolic and a high-dimensional domain that our compositional approach can generalize to more complex problems than the learner has previously encountered, whereas baselines that are not explicitly compositional do not.
10	Successful training of convolutional neural networks is often associated with suffi-ciently deep architectures composed of high amounts of features. These networkstypically rely on a variety of regularization and pruning techniques to convergeto less redundant states. We introduce a novel bottom-up approach to expandrepresentations in fixed-depth architectures. These architectures start from just asingle feature per layer and greedily increase width of individual layers to attaineffective representational capacities needed for a specific task. While networkgrowth can rely on a family of metrics, we propose a computationally efficientversion based on feature time evolution and demonstrate its potency in determin-ing feature importance and a networks’ effective capacity. We demonstrate howautomatically expanded architectures converge to similar topologies that benefitfrom lesser amount of parameters or improved accuracy and exhibit systematiccorrespondence in representational complexity with the specified task. In contrastto conventional design patterns with a typical monotonic increase in the amount offeatures with increased depth, we observe that CNNs perform better when there ismore learnable parameters in intermediate, with falloffs to earlier and later layers.
01	Much attention has been devoted recently to the generalization puzzle in deep learning: large, deep networks can generalize well, but existing theories bounding generalization error are exceedingly loose, and thus cannot explain this striking performance. Furthermore, a major hope is that knowledge may transfer across tasks, so that multi-task learning can improve generalization on individual tasks. However we lack analytic theories that can quantitatively predict how the degree of knowledge transfer depends on the relationship between the tasks. We develop an analytic theory of the nonlinear dynamics of generalization in deep linear networks, both within and across tasks. In particular, our theory provides analytic solutions to the training and testing error of deep networks as a function of training time, number of examples, network size and initialization, and the task structure and SNR. Our theory reveals that deep networks progressively learn the most important task structure first, so that generalization error at the early stopping time primarily depends on task structure and is independent of network size. This suggests any tight bound on generalization error must take into account task structure, and explains observations about real data being learned faster than random data. Intriguingly our theory also reveals the existence of a learning algorithm that proveably out-performs neural network training through gradient descent. Finally, for transfer learning, our theory reveals that knowledge transfer depends sensitively, but computably, on the SNRs and input feature alignments of pairs of tasks.
10	Multi-Label Learning task simultaneously predicting multiple labels has attracted researchers' interest for its wide application. Metric Learning crucially determines the performance of the k nearest neighbor algorithms, the most popular framework handling the multi-label problem.However, the existing advanced multiple-label metric learning suffers the inferior capacity and application restriction. We propose an extendable and end-to-end deep representation approach for metric learning on multi-label data set that is based on neural networks able to operate on feature data or directly on raw image data. We motivate the choice of our network architecture via a Bidirectional Representation learning where the label dependency is also integrated and deep convolutional networks that handle image data. In multi-label metric learning, instances with the more different labels will be dragged the more far away, but ones with identical labels will concentrate together. Our model scales linearly in the number of instances and trains deep neural networks that encode both input data and output labels, then, obtains a metric space for testing data. In a number of experiments on multi-labels tasks, we demonstrate that our approach is better than related methods based on the systematic metric and its extendability.   
10	Successfully training deep neural networks often requires either {batch normalization}, appropriate {weight initialization}, both of which come with their own challenges. We propose an alternative, geometrically motivated method for training. Using elementary results from linear programming, we introduce Farkas layers: a method that ensures at least one neuron is active at a given layer. Focusing on residual networks with ReLU activation, we empirically demonstrate a significant improvement in training capacity in the absence of batch normalization or methods of initialization across a broad range of network sizes on benchmark datasets.
01	Deep generative models have been successfully used to learn representations for high-dimensional discrete spaces by representing discrete objects as sequences and employing powerful sequence-based deep models. Unfortunately, these sequence-based models often produce invalid sequences: sequences which do not represent any underlying discrete structure; invalid sequences hinder the utility of such models. As a step towards solving this problem, we propose to learn a deep recurrent validator model, which can estimate whether a partial sequence can function as the beginning of a full, valid sequence. This validator provides insight as to how individual sequence elements influence the validity of the overall sequence, and can be used to constrain sequence based models to generate valid sequences — and thus faithfully model discrete objects. Our approach is inspired by reinforcement learning, where an oracle which can evaluate validity of complete sequences provides a sparse reward signal. We demonstrate its effectiveness as a generative model of Python 3 source code for mathematical expressions, and in improving the ability of a variational autoencoder trained on SMILES strings to decode valid molecular structures.
10	We  first pose  the  Unsupervised  Progressive  Learning  (UPL)  problem:   learning salient representations from a non-stationary stream of unlabeled data in which the number of object classes increases with time.  If some limited labeled data is also available, those representations can be associated with specific classes, thus enabling classification tasks.  To solve the UPL problem, we propose an architecture that involves an online clustering module, called Self-Taught Associative Memory (STAM). Layered hierarchies of STAM modules learn based on a combination of online clustering, novelty detection, forgetting outliers, and storing only prototypical representations rather than specific examples. The goal of this paper is to introduce the UPL problem, describe the STAM architecture, and evaluate the latter in the UPL context. 
10	Most domain adaptation methods consider the problem of transferring knowledge to the target domain from a single source dataset. However, in practical applications, we typically have access to multiple sources. In this paper we propose the first approach for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) based on Generative Adversarial Networks. Our method is inspired by the observation that the appearance of a given image depends on three factors: the domain, the style (characterized in terms of low-level features variations) and the content. For this reason we propose to project the image features onto a space where only the dependence from the content is kept, and then re-project this invariant representation onto the pixel space using the target domain and style. In this way, new labeled images can be generated which are used to train a final target classifier. We test our  approach using common MSDA benchmarks, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
10	Generative adversarial nets (GANs) have been successfully applied to the artificial generation of image data. In terms of text data, much has been done on the artificial generation of natural language from a single corpus. We consider multiple text corpora as the input data, for which there can be two applications of GANs: (1) the creation of consistent cross-corpus word embeddings given different word embeddings per corpus; (2) the generation of robust bag-of-words document embeddings for each corpora. We demonstrate our GAN models on real-world text data sets from different corpora, and show that embeddings from both models lead to improvements in supervised learning problems.
10	Unsupervised monocular depth estimation has made great progress after deeplearning is involved. Training with binocular stereo images is considered as agood option as the data can be easily obtained. However, the depth or disparityprediction results show poor performance for the object boundaries. The mainreason is related to the handling of occlusion areas during the training. In this paper,we propose a novel method to overcome this issue. Exploiting disparity mapsproperty, we generate an occlusion mask to block the back-propagation of the occlusionareas during image warping. We also design new networks with flippedstereo images to induce the networks to learn occluded boundaries. It shows thatour method achieves clearer boundaries and better evaluation results on KITTIdriving dataset and Virtual KITTI dataset.
01	Neural programming involves training neural networks to learn programs, mathematics, or logic from data. Previous works have failed to achieve good generalization performance, especially on problems and programs with high complexity or on large domains. This is because they mostly rely either on black-box function evaluations that do not capture the structure of the program, or on detailed execution traces that are expensive to obtain, and hence the training data has poor coverage of the domain under consideration. We present a novel framework that utilizes black-box function evaluations, in conjunction with symbolic expressions that define relationships between the given functions. We employ tree LSTMs to incorporate the structure of the symbolic expression trees. We use tree encoding for numbers present in function evaluation data, based on their decimal representation. We present an evaluation benchmark for this task to demonstrate our proposed model combines symbolic reasoning and function evaluation in a fruitful manner, obtaining high accuracies in our experiments. Our framework generalizes significantly better to expressions of higher depth and is able to fill partial equations with valid completions.
10	    Over the last few years, the phenomenon of adversarial examples --- maliciously constructed inputs that fool trained machine learning models --- has captured the attention of the research community, especially when the adversary is restricted to making small modifications of a correctly handled input. At the same time, less surprisingly, image classifiers lack human-level performance on randomly corrupted images, such as images with additive Gaussian noise. In this work, we show that these are two manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon. We establish this connection in several ways. First, we find that adversarial examples exist at the same distance scales we would expect from a linear model with the same performance on corrupted images. Next, we show that Gaussian data augmentation during training improves robustness to small adversarial perturbations and that adversarial training improves robustness to several types of image corruptions. Finally, we present a model-independent upper bound on the distance from a corrupted image to its nearest error given test performance and show that in practice we already come close to achieving the bound, so that improving robustness further for the corrupted image distribution requires significantly reducing test error. All of this suggests that improving adversarial robustness should go hand in hand with improving performance in the presence of more general and realistic image corruptions. This yields a computationally tractable evaluation metric for defenses to consider: test error in noisy image distributions.
01	The convergence rate and final performance of common deep learning models have significantly benefited from recently proposed heuristics such as learning rate schedules, knowledge distillation, skip connections and normalization layers. In the absence of theoretical underpinnings, controlled experiments aimed at explaining the efficacy of these strategies can aid our understanding of deep learning landscapes and the training dynamics. Existing approaches for empirical analysis rely on tools of linear interpolation and visualizations with dimensionality reduction, each with their limitations. Instead, we revisit the empirical analysis of heuristics through the lens of recently proposed methods for loss surface and representation analysis, viz. mode connectivity and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and hypothesize reasons why the heuristics succeed. In particular, we explore knowledge distillation and learning rate heuristics of (cosine) restarts and warmup using mode connectivity and CCA.  Our empirical analysis suggests that: (a) the reasons often quoted for the success of cosine annealing are not evidenced in practice; (b) that the effect of learning rate warmup is to prevent the deeper layers from creating training instability; and (c) that the latent knowledge shared by the teacher is primarily disbursed in the deeper layers.
01	Unsupervised domain adaptation is a promising avenue to enhance the performance of deep neural networks on a target domain, using labels only from a source domain. However, the two predominant methods, domain discrepancy reduction learning and semi-supervised learning, are not readily applicable when source and target domains do not share a common label space. This paper addresses the above scenario by learning a representation space that retains discriminative power on both the (labeled) source and (unlabeled) target domains while keeping representations for the two domains well-separated. Inspired by a theoretical analysis, we first reformulate the disjoint classification task, where the source and target domains correspond to non-overlapping class labels, to a verification one. To handle both within and cross domain verifications, we propose a Feature Transfer Network (FTN) to separate the target feature space from the original source space while aligned with a transformed source space. Moreover, we present a non-parametric multi-class entropy minimization loss to further boost the discriminative power of FTNs on the target domain. In experiments, we first illustrate how FTN works in a controlled setting of adapting from MNIST-M to MNIST with disjoint digit classes between the two domains and then demonstrate the effectiveness of FTNs through state-of-the-art performances on a cross-ethnicity face recognition problem.
01	In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages semi-supervised models to improve unsupervised clustering performance. To leverage semi-supervised models, we first need to automatically generate labels, called pseudo-labels. We find that prior approaches for generating pseudo-labels hurt clustering performance because of their low accuracy. Instead, we use an ensemble of deep networks  to construct a similarity graph, from which we extract high accuracy pseudo-labels. The approach of finding high quality pseudo-labels using ensembles and training the semi-supervised model is iterated, yielding continued improvement. We show that our approach outperforms state of the art clustering results for multiple image and text datasets. For example, we achieve 54.6% accuracy for CIFAR-10 and 43.9% for 20news, outperforming state of the art by 8-12% in absolute terms.
10	We investigate Relational Graph Attention Networks, a class of models that extends non-relational graph attention mechanisms to incorporate relational information, opening up these methods to a wider variety of problems. A thorough evaluation of these models is performed, and comparisons are made against established benchmarks. To provide a meaningful comparison, we retrain Relational Graph Convolutional Networks, the spectral counterpart of Relational Graph Attention Networks, and evaluate them under the same conditions. We find that Relational Graph Attention Networks perform worse than anticipated, although some configurations are marginally beneficial for modelling molecular properties. We provide insights as to why this may be, and suggest both modifications to evaluation strategies, as well as directions to investigate for future work.
10	Autonomous agents that must exhibit flexible and broad capabilities will need to be equipped with large repertoires of skills. Defining each skill with a manually-designed reward function limits this repertoire and imposes a manual engineering burden. Self-supervised agents that set their own goals can automate this process, but designing appropriate goal setting objectives can be difficult, and often involves heuristic design decisions. In this paper, we propose a formal exploration objective for goal-reaching policies that maximizes state coverage. We show that this objective is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the goal distribution together with goal reaching performance, where goals correspond to full state observations. To instantiate this principle, we present an algorithm called Skew-Fit for learning a maximum-entropy goal distributions. Skew-Fit enables self-supervised agents to autonomously choose and practice reaching diverse goals. We show that, under certain regularity conditions, our method converges to a uniform distribution over the set of valid states, even when we do not know this set beforehand. Our experiments show that it can learn a variety of manipulation tasks from images, including opening a door with a real robot, entirely from scratch and without any manually-designed reward function.
10	High throughput and low latency inference of deep neural networks are critical for the deployment of deep learning applications. This paper presents a general technique toward 8-bit low precision inference of convolutional neural networks, including 1) channel-wise scale factors of weights, especially for depthwise convolution, 2) Winograd convolution, and 3) topology-wise 8-bit support. We experiment the techniques on top of a widely-used deep learning framework. The 8-bit optimized model is automatically generated with a calibration process from FP32 model without the need of fine-tuning or retraining. We perform a systematical and comprehensive study on 18 widely-used convolutional neural networks and demonstrate the effectiveness of 8-bit low precision inference across a wide range of applications and use cases, including image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and super resolution. We show that the inference throughputand latency are improved by 1.6X and 1.5X respectively with minimal within 0.6%1to no loss in accuracy from FP32 baseline. We believe the methodology can provide the guidance and reference design of 8-bit low precision inference for other frameworks. All the code and models will be publicly available soon.
10	The committor function is a central object of study in understanding transitions between metastable states in complex systems. However, computing the committor function for realistic systems at low temperatures is a challenging task, due to the curse of dimensionality and the scarcity of transition data. In this paper, we introduce a computational approach that overcomes these issues and achieves good performance on complex benchmark problems with rough energy landscapes. The new approach combines deep learning, importance sampling and feature engineering techniques. This establishes an alternative practical method for studying rare transition events among metastable states of complex, high dimensional systems.
10	Designing efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization appears ubiquitously in various scientific fields. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks have gained considerable attention as a new approach: they can automatically learn the design of a good solver without using any sophisticated knowledge or hand-crafted heuristic specialized for the target problem. However, the number of stages (until reaching the final solution) required by existing DRL solvers is proportional to the size of the input graph, which hurts their scalability to large-scale instances. In this paper, we seek to resolve this issue by proposing a novel design of DRL's policy, coined auto-deferring policy (ADP), automatically stretching or shrinking its decision process. Specifically, it decides whether to finalize the value of each vertex at the current stage or defer to determine it at later stages. We apply the proposed ADP framework to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, a prototype of NP-complete problems, under various scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvement of ADP over the current state-of-the-art DRL scheme in terms of computational efficiency and approximation quality. The reported performance of our generic DRL scheme is also comparable with that of the state-of-the-art solvers specialized for MIS, e.g., ADP outperforms them for some graphs with millions of vertices. 
10	We propose a general-purpose approach to discovering active learning (AL) strategies from data. These strategies are transferable from one domain to another and can be used in conjunction with many machine learning models. To this end, we formalize the annotation process as a Markov decision process, design universal state and action spaces and introduce a new reward function that precisely reflects the AL objective of minimizing the annotation cost We seek to find an optimal (non-myopic) AL strategy using reinforcement learning. We evaluate the learned strategies on multiple unrelated domains and show that they consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines.
10	Guarantees in deep learning are hard to achieve due to the interplay of flexible modeling schemes and complex tasks. Invertible neural networks (INNs), however, provide several mathematical guarantees by design, such as the ability to approximate non-linear diffeomorphisms. One less studied advantage of INNs is that they enable the design of bi-Lipschitz functions. This property has been used implicitly by various works to design generative models, memory-saving gradient computation, regularize classifiers, and solve inverse problems. In this work, we study Lipschitz constants of invertible architectures in order to investigate guarantees on stability of their inverse and forward mapping. Our analysis reveals that commonly-used INN building blocks can easily become non-invertible, leading to questionable ``exact'' log likelihood computations and training difficulties. We introduce a set of numerical analysis tools to diagnose non-invertibility in practice. Finally, based on our theoretical analysis, we show how to guarantee numerical invertibility for one of the most common INN architectures.
10	Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) is able to accelerate the acquisition of new tasks by learning from past experience. Current meta-RL methods usually learn to adapt to new tasks by directly optimizing the parameters of policies over primitive actions. However, for complex tasks which requires sophisticated control strategies, it would be quite inefficient to to directly learn such a meta-policy. Moreover, this problem can become more severe and even fail in spare reward settings, which is quite common in practice. To this end, we propose a new meta-RL algorithm called meta goal-generation for hierarchical RL (MGHRL) by leveraging hierarchical actor-critic framework. Instead of directly generate policies over primitive actions for new tasks, MGHRL learns to generate high-level meta strategies over subgoals given past experience and leaves the rest of how to achieve subgoals as independent RL subtasks. Our empirical results on several challenging simulated robotics environments show that our method enables more efficient and effective meta-learning from past experience and outperforms state-of-the-art meta-RL and Hierarchical-RL methods in sparse reward settings.
10	"Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) are finding increasingly widespread use in many application domains. Despite outstanding progress, quantitative evaluation of such models often involves multiple distinct metrics to assess different desirable properties, such as image quality, conditional consistency, and intra-conditioning diversity. In this setting, model benchmarking becomes a challenge, as each metric may indicate a different ""best"" model. In this paper, we propose the Frechet Joint Distance (FJD), which is defined as the Frechet distance between joint distributions of images and conditioning, allowing it to implicitly capture the aforementioned properties in a single metric. We conduct proof-of-concept experiments on a controllable synthetic dataset, which consistently highlight the benefits of FJD when compared to currently established metrics. Moreover, we use the newly introduced metric to compare existing cGAN-based models for a variety of conditioning modalities (e.g. class labels, object masks, bounding boxes, images, and text captions). We show that FJD can be used as a promising single metric for model benchmarking."
10	In the multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) paradigm, the relative importance of each environment objective is often unknown prior to training, so agents must learn to specialize their behavior to optimize different combinations of environment objectives that are specified post-training. These are typically linear combinations, so the agent is effectively parameterized by a weight vector that describes how to balance competing environment objectives. However, many real world behaviors require non-linear combinations of objectives. Additionally, the conversion between desired behavior and weightings is often unclear.In this work, we explore the use of a language based on propositional logic with quantitative semantics--in place of weight vectors--for specifying non-linear behaviors in an interpretable way. We use a recurrent encoder to encode logical combinations of objectives, and train a MORL agent to generalize over these encodings. We test our agent in several grid worlds with various objectives and show that our agent can generalize to many never-before-seen specifications with performance comparable to single policy baseline agents. We also demonstrate our agent's ability to generate meaningful policies when presented with novel specifications and quickly specialize to novel specifications.
10	In the field of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), how to design a stable training strategy remains an open problem. Wasserstein GANs have largely promoted the stability over the original GANs by introducing Wasserstein distance, but still remain unstable and are prone to a variety of failure modes. In this paper, we present a general framework named Wasserstein-Bounded GAN (WBGAN), which improves a large family of WGAN-based approaches by simply adding an upper-bound constraint to the Wasserstein term. Furthermore, we show that WBGAN can reasonably measure the difference of distributions which almost have no intersection. Experiments demonstrate that WBGAN can stabilize as well as accelerate convergence in the training processes of a series of WGAN-based variants.
01	It is well-known that overparametrized neural networks trained using gradient based methods quickly achieve small training error with appropriate hyperparameter settings. Recent papers have proved this statement theoretically for highly overparametrized networks under reasonable assumptions. These results either assume that the activation function is ReLU or they depend on the minimum eigenvalue of a certain Gram matrix. In the latter case, existing works only prove that this minimum eigenvalue is non-zero and do not provide quantitative bounds which require that this eigenvalue be large. Empirically, a number of alternative activation functions have been proposed which tend to perform better than ReLU at least in some settings but no clear understanding has emerged. This state of affairs underscores the importance of theoretically understanding the impact of activation functions on training. In the present paper, we provide theoretical results about the effect of activation function on the training of highly overparametrized 2-layer neural networks. A crucial property that governs the performance of an activation is whether or not it is smooth: • For non-smooth activations such as ReLU, SELU, ELU, which are not smooth because there is a point where either the ﬁrst order or second order derivative is discontinuous, all eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix are large under minimal assumptions on the data. • For smooth activations such as tanh, swish, polynomial, which have derivatives of all orders at all points, the situation is more complex: if the subspace spanned by the data has small dimension then the minimum eigenvalue of the Gram matrix can be small leading to slow training. But if the dimension is large and the data satisﬁes another mild condition, then the eigenvalues are large. If we allow deep networks, then the small data dimension is not a limitation provided that the depth is sufﬁcient. We discuss a number of extensions and applications of these results.
10	We introduce three generic point cloud processing blocks that improve both accuracy and memory consumption of multiple state-of-the-art networks, thus allowing to design deeper and more accurate networks.The novel processing blocks that facilitate efficient information flow are a convolution-type operation block for point sets that blends neighborhood information in a memory-efficient manner; a multi-resolution point cloud processing block; and a crosslink block that efficiently shares information across low- and high-resolution processing branches. Combining these blocks, we design significantly wider and deeper architectures.We extensively evaluate the proposed architectures on multiple point segmentation benchmarks (ShapeNetPart, ScanNet, PartNet) and report systematic improvements in terms of both accuracy and memory consumption by using our generic modules in conjunction with multiple recent architectures (PointNet++, DGCNN, SpiderCNN, PointCNN). We report a 9.7% increase in IoU on the PartNet dataset, which is the most complex, while decreasing memory footprint  by  57%.
10	We propose a method, called Label Embedding Network, which can learn label representation (label embedding) during the training process of deep networks. With the proposed method, the label embedding is adaptively and automatically learned through back propagation. The original one-hot represented loss function is converted into a new loss function with soft distributions, such that the originally unrelated labels have continuous interactions with each other during the training process. As a result, the trained model can achieve substantially higher accuracy and with faster convergence speed. Experimental results based on competitive tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the learned label embedding is reasonable and interpretable. The proposed method achieves comparable or even better results than the state-of-the-art systems.
01	Machine translation has recently achieved impressive performance thanks to recent advances in deep learning and the availability of large-scale parallel corpora. There have been numerous attempts to extend these successes to low-resource language pairs, yet requiring tens of thousands of parallel sentences. In this work, we take this research direction to the extreme and investigate whether it is possible to learn to translate even without any parallel data. We propose a model that takes sentences from monolingual corpora in two different languages and maps them into the same latent space. By learning to reconstruct in both languages from this shared feature space, the model effectively learns to translate without using any labeled data. We demonstrate our model on two widely used datasets and two language pairs, reporting BLEU scores of 32.8 and 15.1 on the Multi30k and WMT English-French datasets, without using even a single parallel sentence at training time.
10	New estimates for the generalization error are established for a nonlinear regression problem using a two-layer neural network model. These new estimates are a priori in nature in the sense that the bounds depend only on some norms of the underlying functions to be fitted,  not the parameters in the model.  In contrast,  most existing results for neural networks are a posteriori in nature in the sense that the bounds depend on some norms of the model parameters. The error rates are comparable to that of the Monte Carlo method in terms of the size of the dataset.  Moreover, these bounds are equally effective in the over-parametrized regime when the network size is much larger than the size of the dataset. 
10	Mini-batch gradient descent and its variants are commonly used in deep learning. The principle of mini-batch gradient descent is to use noisy gradient calculated on a batch to estimate the real gradient, thus balancing the computation cost per iteration and the uncertainty of noisy gradient. However, its batch size is a fixed hyper-parameter requiring manual setting before training the neural network. Yin et al. (2017) proposed a batch adaptive stochastic gradient descent (BA-SGD) that can dynamically choose a proper batch size as learning proceeds. We extend the BA-SGD to momentum algorithm and evaluate both the BA-SGD and the batch adaptive momentum (BA-Momentum) on two deep learning tasks from natural language processing to image classification. Experiments confirm that batch adaptive methods can achieve a lower loss compared with mini-batch methods after scanning the same epochs of data. Furthermore, our BA-Momentum is more robust against larger step sizes, in that it can dynamically enlarge the batch size to reduce the larger uncertainty brought by larger step sizes. We also identified an interesting phenomenon, batch size boom. The code implementing batch adaptive framework is now open source, applicable to any gradient-based optimization problems.
10	Interactions such as double negation in sentences and scene interactions in images are common forms of complex dependencies captured by state-of-the-art machine learning models. We propose Mahé, a novel approach to provide Model-Agnostic Hierarchical Explanations of how powerful machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, capture these interactions as either dependent on or free of the context of data instances. Specifically, Mahé provides context-dependent explanations by a novel local interpretation algorithm that effectively captures any-order interactions, and obtains context-free explanations through generalizing context-dependent interactions to explain global behaviors. Experimental results show that Mahé obtains improved local interaction interpretations over state-of-the-art methods and successfully provides explanations of interactions that are context-free.
10	In sequential tasks, planning-based agents have a number of advantages over model-free agents, including sample efficiency and interpretability. Recurrent action-conditional latent dynamics models trained from pixel-level observations have been shown to predict future observations conditioned on agent actions accurately enough for planning in some pixel-based control tasks. Typically, models of this type are trained to reconstruct sequences of ground-truth observations, given ground-truth actions. However, an action-conditional model can take input actions and states other than the ground truth, to generate predictions of unobserved counterfactual states. Because counterfactual state predictions are generated by differentiable networks, relationships among counterfactual states can be included in a training objective. We explore the possibilities of counterfactual regularization terms applicable during training of action-conditional sequence models. We evaluate their effect on pixel-level prediction accuracy and model-based agent performance, and we show that counterfactual regularization improves the performance of model-based agents in test-time environments that differ from training.
10	Graph prediction methods that work closely with the structure of the data, e.g., graph generation, commonly ignore the content of its nodes. On the other hand, the solutions that consider the node’s information, e.g., classification, ignore the structure of the whole. And some methods exist in between, e.g., link prediction, but predict the structure piece-wise instead of considering the graph as a whole. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting the structure of the graph and its nodes’ features, we can improve both tasks. We propose the Graph Learning Network (GLN), a simple yet effective process to learn node embeddings and structure prediction functions. Our model uses graph convolutions to propose expected node features, and predict the best structure based on them. We repeat these steps sequentially to enhance the prediction and the embeddings. In contrast to existing generation methods that rely only on the structure of the data, we use the feature on the nodes to predict better relations, similar to what link prediction methods do. However, we propose an holistic approach to process the whole graph for our predictions. Our experiments show that our method predicts consistent structures across a set of problems, while creating meaningful node embeddings.
10	Recent neural network and language models have begun to rely on softmax distributions with an extremely large number of categories. In this context calculating the softmax normalizing constant is prohibitively expensive. This has spurred a growing literature of efficiently computable but biased estimates of the softmax. In this paper we present the first two unbiased algorithms for maximizing the softmax likelihood whose work per iteration is independent of the number of classes and datapoints (and does not require extra work at the end of each epoch). We compare our unbiased methods' empirical performance to the state-of-the-art on seven real world datasets, where they comprehensively outperform all competitors.
10	Independent causal mechanisms are a central concept in the study of causalitywith implications for machine learning tasks. In this work we developan algorithm to recover a set of (inverse) independent mechanisms relatinga distribution transformed by the mechanisms to a reference distribution.The approach is fully unsupervised and based on a set of experts that competefor data to specialize and extract the mechanisms. We test and analyzethe proposed method on a series of experiments based on image transformations.Each expert successfully maps a subset of the transformed datato the original domain, and the learned mechanisms generalize to otherdomains. We discuss implications for domain transfer and links to recenttrends in generative modeling.
10	Hierarchical neural architectures can efficiently capture long-distance dependencies and have been used for many document-level tasks such as summarization, document segmentation, and fine-grained sentiment analysis. However, effective usage of such a large context can difficult to learn, especially in the case where there is limited labeled data available.Building on the recent success of language model pretraining methods for learning flat representations of text, we propose algorithms for pre-training hierarchical document representations from unlabeled data. Unlike prior work, which has focused on pre-training contextual token representations or context-independent sentence/paragraph representations, our hierarchical document representations include fixed-length sentence/paragraph representations which integrate contextual information from the entire documents. Experiments on document segmentation, document-level question answering, and extractive document summarization demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training algorithms.
10	In many reinforcement learning settings, rewards which are extrinsically available to the learning agent are too sparse to train a suitable policy. Beside reward shaping which requires human expertise, utilizing better exploration strategies helps to circumvent the problem of policy training with sparse rewards. In this work, we introduce an exploration approach based on maximizing the entropy of the visited states while learning a goal-conditioned policy. The main contribution of this work is to introduce a novel reward function which combined with a goal proposing scheme, increases the entropy of the visited states faster compared to the prior work. This improves the exploration capability of the agent, and therefore enhances the agent's chance to solve sparse reward problems more efficiently. Our empirical studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to solve different sparse reward problems in comparison to the prior work. 
01	Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) methods are effective for solving two-player zero-sum extensive games with imperfect information with  state-of-the-art results.  However,  the vanilla CFR has to traverse the whole game tree in each round, which is time-consuming in large-scale games. In this paper, we present Lazy-CFR, a CFR algorithm that adopts a lazy update strategy to avoid traversing the whole game tree in each round.  We prove that the regret of Lazy-CFR is almost the same to the regret of the vanilla CFR and only needs to visit a small portion of the game tree.  Thus, Lazy-CFR is provably faster than CFR. Empirical results consistently show that Lazy-CFR is significantly faster than the vanilla CFR.
10	Most deep latent factor models choose simple priors for simplicity, tractabilityor not knowing what prior to use. Recent studies show that the choice ofthe prior may have a profound effect on the expressiveness of the model,especially when its generative network has limited capacity. In this paper, we propose to learn a proper prior from data for adversarial autoencoders(AAEs). We introduce the notion of code generators to transform manually selectedsimple priors into ones that can better characterize the data distribution. Experimental results show that the proposed model can generate better image quality and learn better disentangled representations thanAAEs in both supervised and unsupervised settings. Lastly, we present itsability to do cross-domain translation in a  text-to-image synthesis task.
01	We present Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), a general approach for learning node representations within graph-structured data in an unsupervised manner. DGI relies on maximizing mutual information between patch representations and corresponding high-level summaries of graphs---both derived using established graph convolutional network architectures. The learnt patch representations summarize subgraphs centered around nodes of interest, and can thus be reused for downstream node-wise learning tasks. In contrast to most prior approaches to unsupervised learning with GCNs, DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive and inductive learning setups. We demonstrate competitive performance on a variety of node classification benchmarks, which at times even exceeds the performance of supervised learning.
01	Rules over a knowledge graph (KG) capture interpretable patterns in data and can be used for KG cleaning and completion. Inspired by the TensorLog differentiable logic framework, which compiles rule inference into a sequence of differentiable operations, recently a method called Neural LP has been proposed for learning the parameters as well as the structure of rules. However, it is limited with respect to the treatment of numerical features like age, weight or scientific measurements. We address this limitation by extending Neural LP to learn rules with numerical values, e.g., ”People younger than 18 typically live with their parents“. We demonstrate how dynamic programming and cumulative sum operations can be exploited to ensure efficiency of such extension. Our novel approach allows us to extract more expressive rules with aggregates, which are of higher quality and yield more accurate predictions compared to rules learned by the state-of-the-art methods, as shown by our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
10	We present the first end-to-end verifier of audio classifiers. Compared to existing methods, our approach enables analysis of both, the entire audio processing stage as well as recurrent neural network architectures (e.g., LSTM). The audio processing is verified using novel convex relaxations tailored to feature extraction operations used in audio (e.g., Fast Fourier Transform) while recurrent architectures are certified via a novel binary relaxation for the recurrent unit update. We show the verifier scales to large networks while computing significantly tighter bounds than existing methods for common audio classification benchmarks: on the challenging Google Speech Commands dataset we certify 95% more inputs than the interval approximation (only prior scalable method), for a perturbation of -90dB.
01	Detection of photo manipulation relies on subtle statistical traces, notoriously removed by aggressive lossy compression employed online. We demonstrate that end-to-end modeling of complex photo dissemination channels allows for codec optimization with explicit provenance objectives. We design a lightweight trainable lossy image codec, that delivers competitive rate-distortion performance, on par with best hand-engineered alternatives, but has lower computational footprint on modern GPU-enabled platforms. Our results show that significant improvements in manipulation detection accuracy are possible at fractional costs in bandwidth/storage. Our codec improved the accuracy from 37% to 86% even at very low bit-rates, well below the practicality of JPEG (QF 20). 
01	We investigate multi-task learning approaches that use a shared feature representation for all tasks. To better understand the transfer of task information, we study an architecture with a shared module for all tasks and a separate output module for each task. We study the theory of this setting on linear and ReLU-activated models. Our key observation is that whether or not tasks' data are well-aligned can significantly affect the performance of multi-task learning. We show that misalignment between task data can cause negative transfer (or hurt performance) and provide sufficient conditions for positive transfer. Inspired by the theoretical insights, we show that aligning tasks' embedding layers leads to performance gains for multi-task training and transfer learning on the GLUE benchmark and sentiment analysis tasks; for example, we obtained a 2.35% GLUE score average improvement on 5 GLUE tasks over BERT LARGE using our alignment method. We also design an SVD-based task re-weighting scheme and show that it improves the robustness of multi-task training on a multi-label image dataset.
01	 As people learn to navigate the world, autonomic nervous system (e.g., ``fight or flight) responses provide intrinsic feedback about the potential consequence of action choices (e.g., becoming nervous when close to a cliff edge or driving fast around a bend.) Physiological changes are correlated with these biological preparations to protect one-self from danger. We present a novel approach to reinforcement learning that leverages a task-independent intrinsic reward function trained on peripheral pulse measurements that are correlated with human autonomic nervous system responses. Our hypothesis is that such reward functions can circumvent the challenges associated with sparse and skewed rewards in reinforcement learning settings and can help improve sample efficiency. We test this in a simulated driving environment and show that it can increase the speed of learning and reduce the number of collisions during the learning stage.
10	Flow-based generative models are powerful exact likelihood models with efficient sampling and inference. Despite their computational efficiency, flow-based models generally have much worse density modeling performance compared to state-of-the-art autoregressive models. In this paper, we investigate and improve upon three limiting design choices employed by flow-based models in prior work: the use of uniform noise for dequantization, the use of inexpressive affine flows, and the use of purely convolutional conditioning networks in coupling layers. Based on our findings, we propose Flow++, a new flow-based model that is now the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive model for unconditional density estimation on standard image benchmarks. Our work has begun to close the significant performance gap that has so far existed between autoregressive models and flow-based models.
01	In this paper we approach two relevant deep learning topics: i) tackling of graph structured input data and ii) a better understanding and analysis of deep networks and related learning algorithms. With this in mind we focus on the topological classification of reachability in a particular subset of planar graphs (Mazes). Doing so, we are able to model the topology of data while staying in Euclidean space, thus allowing its processing with standard CNN architectures. We suggest a suitable architecture for this problem and show that it can express a perfect solution to the classification task. The shape of the cost function around this solution is also derived and, remarkably, does not depend on the size of the maze in the large maze limit. Responsible for this behavior are rare events in the dataset which strongly regulate the shape of the cost function near this global minimum. We further identify an obstacle to learning in the form of poorly performing local minima in which the network chooses to ignore some of the inputs. We further support our claims with training experiments and numerical analysis of the cost function on networks with up to $128$ layers.
10	"Are neural networks biased toward simple functions?Does depth always help learn more complex features?Is training the last layer of a network as good as training all layers?These questions seem unrelated at face value, but in this work we give all of them a common treatment from the spectral perspective.We will study the spectra of the *Conjugate Kernel, CK,* (also called the *Neural Network-Gaussian Process Kernel*), and the *Neural Tangent Kernel, NTK*.Roughly, the CK and the NTK tell us respectively ``""what a network looks like at initialization"" and ""``what a network looks like during and after training.""Their spectra then encode valuable information about the initial distribution and the training and generalization properties of neural networks.By analyzing the eigenvalues, we lend novel insights into the questions put forth at the beginning, and we verify these insights by extensive experiments of neural networks.We believe the computational tools we develop here for analyzing the spectra of CK and NTK serve as a solid foundation for future studies of deep neural networks.We have open-sourced the code for it and for generating the plots in this paper at github.com/jxVmnLgedVwv6mNcGCBy/NNspectra."
10	One intriguing property of neural networks is their inherent vulnerability to adversarial inputs, which are maliciously crafted samples to trigger target networks to misbehave. The state-of-the-art attacks generate adversarial inputs using either pixel perturbation or spatial transformation. Thus far, several provable defenses have been proposed against pixel perturbation-based attacks; yet, little is known about whether such solutions exist for spatial transformation-based attacks. This paper bridges this striking gap by conducting the first systematic study on provable defenses against spatially transformed adversarial inputs. Our findings convey mixed messages. On the impossibility side, we show that such defenses may not exist in practice: for any given networks, it is possible to find legitimate inputs and imperceptible transformations to generate adversarial inputs that force arbitrarily large errors. On the possibility side, we show that it is still feasible to construct adversarial training methods to significantly improve the resilience of networks against adversarial inputs over empirical datasets. We believe our findings provide insights for designing more effective defenses against spatially transformed adversarial inputs.
10	Adaptive gradient approaches that automatically adjust the learning rate on a per-feature basis have been very popular for training deep networks. This rich class of algorithms includes Adagrad, RMSprop, Adam, and recent extensions. All these algorithms have adopted diagonal matrix adaptation, due to the prohibitive computational burden of manipulating full matrices in high-dimensions. In this paper, we show that block-diagonal matrix adaptation can be a practical and powerful solution that can effectively utilize structural characteristics of deep learning architectures to significantly improve convergence and out-of-sample generalization. We present AdaBlock, a general framework for block-diagonal matrix adaption via coordinate grouping, which includes counterparts of the aforementioned algorithms. We prove its convergence in non-convex optimization and provide generalization error bounds, highlighting benefits compared to diagonal versions. In addition, we propose two techniques enriching the AdaBlock family: i) an efficient spectrum-clipping scheme that benefits from superior generalization performance of SGD and ii) a randomized layer-wise block diagonal adaptation scheme to further reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments show that AdaBlock achieves state-of-the-art results on several deep learning tasks, and can outperform adaptive diagonal methods, vanilla SGD, as well as a modified version of full-matrix adaptation proposed very recently.
01	 Several recently proposed stochastic optimization methods that have been successfully used in training deep networks such as RMSProp, Adam, Adadelta, Nadam are based on using gradient updates scaled by square roots of exponential moving averages of squared past gradients. In many applications, e.g. learning with large output spaces, it has been empirically observed that these algorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in nonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the exponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit example of a simple convex optimization setting where Adam does not converge to the optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous analysis of Adam algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues can be fixed by endowing such algorithms with ``long-term memory'' of past gradients, and propose new variants of the Adam algorithm which not only fix the convergence issues but often also lead to improved empirical performance.
10	"From a young age humans learn to use grammatical principles to hierarchically combine words into sentences. Action grammars is the parallel idea; that there is an underlying set of rules (a ""grammar"") that govern how we hierarchically combine actions to form new, more complex actions. We introduce the Action Grammar Reinforcement Learning (AG-RL) framework which leverages the concept of action grammars to consistently improve the sample efficiency of Reinforcement Learning agents. AG-RL works by using a grammar inference algorithm to infer the “action grammar"" of an agent midway through training, leading to a higher-level action representation. The agent's action space is then augmented with macro-actions identified by the grammar. We apply this framework to Double Deep Q-Learning (AG-DDQN) and a discrete action version of Soft Actor-Critic (AG-SAC) and find that it improves performance in 8 out of 8 tested Atari games (median +31%, max +668%) and 19 out of 20 tested Atari games (median +96%, maximum +3,756%) respectively without substantive hyperparameter tuning. We also show that AG-SAC beats the model-free state-of-the-art for sample efficiency in 17 out of the 20 tested Atari games (median +62%, maximum +13,140%), again without substantive hyperparameter tuning."
01	The high-quality node embeddings learned from the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been applied to a wide range of node-based applications and some of them have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, when applying node embeddings learned from GNNs to generate graph embeddings, the scalar node representation may not suffice to preserve the node/graph properties efficiently, resulting in sub-optimal graph embeddings.Inspired by the Capsule Neural Network (CapsNet), we propose the Capsule Graph Neural Network (CapsGNN), which adopts the concept of capsules to address the weakness in existing GNN-based graph embeddings algorithms. By extracting node features in the form of capsules, routing mechanism can be utilized to capture important information at the graph level. As a result, our model generates multiple embeddings for each graph to capture graph properties from different aspects. The attention module incorporated in CapsGNN is used to tackle graphs with various sizes which also enables the model to focus on critical parts of the graphs.Our extensive evaluations with 10 graph-structured datasets demonstrate that CapsGNN has a powerful mechanism that operates to capture macroscopic properties of the whole graph by data-driven. It outperforms other SOTA techniques on several graph classification tasks, by virtue of the new instrument.
10	Fully convolutional deep correlation networks are integral components of state-of-the-art approaches to single object visual tracking. It is commonly assumed thatthese networks perform tracking by detection by matching features of the objectinstance with features of the entire frame. Strong architectural priors and conditioningon the object representation is thought to encourage this tracking strategy.Despite these strong priors, we show that deep trackers often default to “tracking-by-saliency” detection – without relying on the object instance representation. Ouranalysis shows that despite being a useful prior, salience detection can prevent theemergence of more robust tracking strategies in deep networks. This leads us tointroduce an auxiliary detection task that encourages more discriminative objectrepresentations that improve tracking performance.
10	Adaptive moment methods have been remarkably successful for optimization under the presence of high dimensional or sparse gradients, in parallel to this, adaptive sampling probabilities for SGD have allowed optimizers to improve convergence rates by prioritizing examples to learn efficiently. Numerous applications in the past have implicitly combined adaptive moment methods with adaptive probabilities yet the theoretical guarantees of such procedures have not been explored. We formalize double adaptive stochastic gradient methods DASGrad as an optimization technique and analyze its convergence improvements in a stochastic convex optimization setting, we provide empirical validation of our findings with convex and non convex objectives. We observe that the benefits of the method increase with the model complexity and variability of the gradients, and we explore the resulting utility in extensions to transfer learning. 
10	Given a video and a sentence, the goal of weakly-supervised video moment retrieval is to locate the video segment which is described by the sentence without having access to temporal annotations during training.  Instead, a model must learn how to identify the correct segment (i.e. moment) when only being provided with video-sentence pairs.  Thus, an inherent challenge is automatically inferring the latent correspondence between visual and language representations. To facilitate this alignment, we propose our Weakly-supervised Moment Alignment Network (wMAN) which exploits a multi-level co-attention mechanism to learn richer multimodal representations. The aforementioned mechanism is comprised of a Frame-By-Word interaction module as well as a novel Word-Conditioned Visual Graph (WCVG). Our approach also incorporates a novel application of positional encodings, commonly used in Transformers, to learn visual-semantic representations that contain contextual information of their relative positions in the temporal sequence through iterative message-passing. Comprehensive experiments on the DiDeMo and Charades-STA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned representations: our combined wMAN model not only outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised method by a significant margin but also does better than strongly-supervised state-of-the-art methods on some metrics.
10	This paper presents a storage-efficient learning model titled Recursive Binary Neural Networks for embedded and mobile devices having a limited amount of on-chip data storage such as hundreds of kilo-Bytes. The main idea of the proposed model is to recursively recycle data storage of weights (parameters) during training. This enables a device with a given storage constraint to train and instantiate a neural network classifier with a larger number of weights on a chip, achieving better classification accuracy. Such efficient use of on-chip storage reduces off-chip storage accesses, improving energy-efficiency and speed of training. We verified the proposed training model with deep and convolutional neural network classifiers on the MNIST and voice activity detection benchmarks. For the deep neural network, our model achieves data storage requirement of as low as 2 bits/weight, whereas the conventional binary neural network learning models require data storage of 8 to 32 bits/weight. With the same amount of data storage, our model can train a bigger network having more weights, achieving 1% less test error than the conventional binary neural network learning model. To achieve the similar classification error, the conventional binary neural network model requires 4× more data storage for weights than our proposed model. For the convolution neural network classifier, the proposed model achieves 2.4% less test error for the same on-chip storage or 6× storage savings to achieve the similar accuracy.
10	Machine learning (ML) especially deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied to real-world applications. However, recent studies show that DNNs are vulnerable to carefully crafted \emph{adversarial examples} which  only deviate from the original data by a small magnitude of perturbation. While there has been great interest on generating imperceptible adversarial examples in continuous data domain (e.g. image and audio) to explore the model vulnerabilities, generating \emph{adversarial text} in the discrete domain is still challenging. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a general targeted attack framework \advcodec for adversarial text generation which addresses the challenge of discrete input space and be easily adapted to general natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In particular, we propose a tree based autoencoder to encode discrete text data into continuous vector space, upon which we optimize the adversarial perturbation. With the tree based decoder, it is possible to ensure the grammar correctness of the generated text; and the tree based encoder enables flexibility of making manipulations on different levels of text, such as sentence (\advcodecsent) and word (\advcodecword) levels. We consider multiple attacking scenarios, including appending an adversarial sentence or adding unnoticeable words to a given paragraph, to achieve arbitrary \emph{targeted attack}. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we consider two most representative NLP tasks: sentiment analysis and question answering (QA). Extensive experimental results show that \advcodec has successfully attacked both tasks. In particular, our attack causes a BERT-based sentiment classifier accuracy to drop from $0.703$ to $0.006$, and a BERT-based QA model's F1 score to drop from $88.62$ to $33.21$ (with best targeted attack F1 score as $46.54$). Furthermore, we show that the white-box generated adversarial texts can transfer across other black-box models, shedding light on an effective way to examine the robustness of existing NLP models.
01	The goal of few-shot learning is to learn a classifier that generalizes well even when trained with a limited number of training instances per class. The recently introduced meta-learning approaches tackle this problem by learning a generic classifier across a large number of multiclass classification tasks and generalizing the model to a new task. Yet, even with such meta-learning, the low-data problem in the novel classification task still remains. In this paper, we propose Transductive Propagation Network (TPN), a novel meta-learning framework for transductive inference that classifies the entire test set at once to alleviate the low-data problem. Specifically, we propose to learn to propagate labels from labeled instances to unlabeled test instances, by learning a graph construction module that exploits the manifold structure in the data. TPN jointly learns both the parameters of feature embedding and the graph construction in an end-to-end manner.  We validate TPN on multiple benchmark datasets, on which it largely outperforms existing few-shot learning approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art results. 
10	A typical experiment to study cognitive function is to train animals to perform tasks, while the researcher records the electrical activity of the animals neurons. The main obstacle faced, when using this type of electrophysiological experiment to uncover the circuit mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, is our incomplete access to relevant circuits in the brain. One promising approach is to model neural circuits using an artificial neural network (ANN), which can provide complete access to the “neural circuits” responsible for a behavior. More recently, reinforcement learning models have been adopted to understand the functions of cortico-basal ganglia circuits as reward-based learning has been found in mammalian brain. In this paper, we propose a Biologically-plausible Actor-Critic with Episodic Memory (B-ACEM) framework to model a prefrontal cortex-basal ganglia-hippocampus (PFC-BG) circuit, which is verified to capture the behavioral findings from a well-known perceptual decision-making task, i.e., random dots motion discrimination. This B-ACEM framework links neural computation to behaviors, on which we can explore how episodic memory should be considered to govern future decision. Experiments are conducted using different settings of the episodic memory and results show that all patterns of episodic memories can speed up learning. In particular, salient events are prioritized to propagate reward information and guide decisions. Our B-ACEM framework and the built-on experiments give inspirations to both designs for more standard decision-making models in biological system and a more biologically-plausible ANN.
01	The backpropagation (BP) algorithm is often thought to be biologically implausible in the brain. One of the main reasons is that BP requires symmetric weight matrices in the feedforward and feedback pathways. To address this “weight transport problem” (Grossberg, 1987), two biologically-plausible algorithms, proposed by Liao et al. (2016) and Lillicrap et al. (2016), relax BP’s weight symmetry requirements and demonstrate comparable learning capabilities to that of BP on small datasets. However, a recent study by Bartunov et al. (2018) finds that although feedback alignment (FA) and some variants of target-propagation (TP) perform well on MNIST and CIFAR, they perform significantly worse than BP on ImageNet. Here, we additionally evaluate the sign-symmetry (SS) algorithm (Liao et al., 2016), which differs from both BP and FA in that the feedback and feedforward weights do not share magnitudes but share signs. We examined the performance of sign-symmetry and feedback alignment on ImageNet and MS COCO datasets using different network architectures (ResNet-18 and AlexNet for ImageNet; RetinaNet for MS COCO). Surprisingly, networks trained with sign-symmetry can attain classification performance approaching that of BP-trained networks. These results complement the study by Bartunov et al. (2018) and establish a new benchmark for future biologically-plausible learning algorithms on more difficult datasets and more complex architectures.
01	Achieving faster execution with shorter compilation time can foster further diversity and innovation in neural networks. However, the current paradigm of executing neural networks either relies on hand-optimized libraries, traditional compilation heuristics, or very recently genetic algorithms and other stochastic methods. These methods suffer from frequent costly hardware measurements rendering them not only too time consuming but also suboptimal. As such, we devise a solution that can learn to quickly adapt to a previously unseen design space for code optimization, both accelerating the search and improving the output performance. This solution dubbed Chameleon leverages reinforcement learning whose solution takes fewer steps to converge, and develops an adaptive sampling algorithm that not only focuses on the costly samples (real hardware measurements) on representative points but also uses a domain-knowledge inspired logic to improve the samples itself. Experimentation with real hardware shows that Chameleon provides 4.45x speed up in optimization time over AutoTVM, while also improving inference time of the modern deep networks by 5.6%.
10	When applying machine learning to sensitive data one has to balance between accuracy, information leakage, and computational-complexity. Recent studies have shown that Homomorphic Encryption (HE) can be used for protecting against information leakage while applying neural networks. However, this comes with the cost of limiting the kind of neural networks that can be used (and hence the accuracy) and with latency of the order of several minutes even for relatively simple networks. In this study we improve on previous results both in the kind of networks that can be applied and in terms of the latency. Most of the improvement is achieved by novel ways to represent the data to make better use of the capabilities of the encryption scheme.
01	Neural network quantization is becoming an industry standard to efficiently deploy deep learning models on hardware platforms, such as CPU, GPU, TPU, and FPGAs. However, we observe that the conventional quantization approaches are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper aims to raise people's awareness about the security of the quantized models, and we designed a novel quantization methodology to jointly optimize the efficiency and robustness of deep learning models. We first conduct an empirical study to show that vanilla quantization suffers more from adversarial attacks. We observe that the inferior robustness comes from the error amplification effect, where the quantization operation further enlarges the distance caused by amplified noise. Then we propose a novel Defensive Quantization (DQ) method by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the network during quantization, such that the magnitude of the adversarial noise remains non-expansive during inference. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets demonstrate that our new quantization method can defend neural networks against adversarial examples, and even achieves superior robustness than their full-precision counterparts, while maintaining the same hardware efficiency as vanilla quantization approaches. As a by-product, DQ can also improve the accuracy of quantized models without adversarial attack. 
10	We propose Bayesian Deep Q-Network  (BDQN), a  practical Thompson sampling based Reinforcement Learning (RL) Algorithm. Thompson sampling allows for targeted exploration in high dimensions through posterior sampling but is usually computationally expensive. We address this limitation by introducing uncertainty only at the output layer of the network through a Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) model, which can be trained with fast closed-form updates and its samples can be drawn efficiently through the Gaussian distribution. We apply our method to a wide range of Atari Arcade Learning Environments. Since BDQN carries out more efficient exploration, it is able to reach higher rewards substantially faster than a key baseline, DDQN.
01	"Adversarial neural networks solve many important problems in data science, but are notoriously difficult to train. These difficulties come from the fact that optimal weights for adversarial nets correspond to saddle points, and not minimizers, of the loss function. The alternating stochastic gradient methods typically used for such problems do not reliably converge to saddle points, and when convergence does happen it is often highly sensitive to learning rates. We propose a simple modification of stochastic gradient descent that stabilizes adversarial networks. We show, both in theory and practice, that the proposed method reliably converges to saddle points. This makes adversarial networks less likely to ""collapse,"" and enables faster training with larger learning rates."
01	Most research on lifelong learning applies to images or games, but not language.We present LAMOL, a simple yet effective method for lifelong language learning (LLL) based on language modeling.LAMOL replays pseudo-samples of previous tasks while requiring no extra memory or model capacity.Specifically, LAMOL is a language model that simultaneously learns to solve the tasks and generate training samples.When the model is trained for a new task, it generates pseudo-samples of previous tasks for training alongside data for the new task.The results show that LAMOL prevents catastrophic forgetting without any sign of intransigence and can perform five very different language tasks sequentially with only one model. Overall, LAMOL outperforms previous methods by a considerable margin and is only 2-3% worse than multitasking, which is usually considered the LLL upper bound.The source code is available at https://github.com/jojotenya/LAMOL.
10	Encoding images as a series of high-level constructs, such as brush strokes or discrete shapes, can often be key to both human and machine understanding. In many cases, however, data is only available in pixel form. We present a method for generating images directly in a high-level domain (e.g.  brush strokes), without the need for real pairwise data.  Specifically, we train a ”canvas” network to imitate the mapping of high-level constructs to pixels, followed by a high-level ”drawing” network which is optimized through this mapping towards solving a desired image recreation or translation task.  We successfully discover sequential vector representations of symbols,  large sketches,  and 3D objects,  utilizing only pixel data.  We display applications of our method in image segmentation, and present several ablation studies comparing various configurations.
10	We explore self-supervision as a way to learn general purpose audiorepresentations. Specifically, we propose self-supervised tasks that exploit thetemporal context in the spectrogram domain. The temporal gap task estimatesthe distance between two short audio segments extracted at random from the sameaudio clip. The Audio2Vec task is inspired by Word2Vec, a populartechnique used to learn word embeddings, and aim at reconstructing a spectrogramslice from past and future slices or, alternatively, at reconstructing thecontext of surrounding slices from the current slice. We evaluate the quality ofthe embeddings produced by the self-supervised learning models, measuring theaccuracy of linear classifiers, which receive the embeddings as input and aim ataddressing a variety of downstream audio tasks. Our results show that thelearned representations partially bridge the performance gap with fullysupervised models of similar size, and for some tasks even approach theirperformance.
01	"An open secret in contemporary machine learning is that many models work beautifully on standard benchmarks but fail to generalize outside the lab. This has been attributed to biased training data, which provide poor coverage over real world events. Generative models are no exception, but recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) suggest otherwise -- these models can now synthesize strikingly realistic and diverse images. Is generative modeling of photos a solved problem? We show that although current GANs can fit standard datasets very well, they still fall short of being comprehensive models of the visual manifold. In particular, we study their ability to fit simple transformations such as camera movements and color changes. We find that the models reflect the biases of the datasets on which they are trained (e.g., centered objects), but that they also exhibit some capacity for generalization: by ""steering"" in latent space, we can shift the distribution while still creating realistic images. We hypothesize that the degree of distributional shift is related to the breadth of the training data distribution. Thus, we conduct experiments to quantify the limits of GAN transformations and introduce techniques to mitigate the problem.   Code is released on our project page: https://ali-design.github.io/gan_steerability/"
01	Neural networks exhibit good generalization behavior in theover-parameterized regime, where the number of network parametersexceeds the number of observations. Nonetheless,current generalization bounds for neural networks fail to explain thisphenomenon. In an attempt to bridge this gap, we study the problem oflearning a two-layer over-parameterized neural network, when the data is generated by a linearly separable function. In the case where the network has LeakyReLU activations, we provide both optimization and generalization guarantees for over-parameterized networks.Specifically, we prove convergence rates of SGD to a globalminimum and provide generalization guarantees for this global minimumthat are independent of the network size. Therefore, our result clearly shows that the use of SGD for optimization both finds a global minimum, and avoids overfitting despite the high capacity of the model. This is the first theoretical demonstration that SGD can avoid overfitting, when learning over-specified neural network classifiers.
10	Determining the number of latent dimensions is a ubiquitous problem in machinelearning. In this study, we introduce a novel method that relies on SVD to discoverthe number of latent dimensions. The general principle behind the method is tocompare the curve of singular values of the SVD decomposition of a data set withthe randomized data set curve. The inferred number of latent dimensions correspondsto the crossing point of the two curves. To evaluate our methodology, wecompare it with competing methods such as Kaisers eigenvalue-greater-than-onerule (K1), Parallel Analysis (PA), Velicers MAP test (Minimum Average Partial).We also compare our method with the Silhouette Width (SW) technique which isused in different clustering methods to determine the optimal number of clusters.The result on synthetic data shows that the Parallel Analysis and our method havesimilar results and more accurate than the other methods, and that our methods isslightly better result than the Parallel Analysis method for the sparse data sets.
10	Spectral Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a generalization of convolutional networks to learning on graph-structured data. Applications of spectral GCNs have been successful, but limited to a few problems where the graph is fixed, such as shape correspondence and node classification. In this work, we address this limitation by revisiting a particular family of spectral graph networks, Chebyshev GCNs, showing its efficacy in solving graph classification tasks with a variable graph structure and size. Current GCNs also restrict graphs to have at most one edge between any pair of nodes. To this end, we propose a novel multigraph network that learns from multi-relational graphs. We explicitly model different types of edges: annotated edges, learned edges with abstract meaning, and hierarchical edges. We also experiment with different ways to fuse the representations extracted from different edge types. This restriction is sometimes implied from a dataset, however, we relax this restriction for all kinds of datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of chemical, social, and vision graph classification benchmarks.
10	Various methods of measuring unit selectivity have been developed with the aim of better understanding how neural networks work.  But the different measures provide divergent estimates of selectivity, and this has led to different conclusions regarding the conditions in which selective object representations are learned and the functional relevance of these representations. In an attempt to better characterize object selectivity, we undertake a comparison of various selectivity measures on a large set of units in AlexNet, including localist selectivity, precision, class-conditional mean activity selectivity (CCMAS), network dissection, the human interpretation of activation maximization (AM) images, and standard signal-detection measures.  We find that the different measures provide different estimates of object selectivity, with precision and CCMAS measures providing misleadingly high estimates. Indeed, the most selective units had a poor hit-rate or a high false-alarm rate (or both) in object classification, making them poor object detectors.  We fail to find any units that are even remotely as selective as the 'grandmother cell' units reported in recurrent neural networks. In order to generalize these results, we compared selectivity measures on a few units in VGG-16 and GoogLeNet trained on the ImageNet or Places-365 datasets that have been described as 'object detectors'. Again, we find poor hit-rates and high false-alarm rates for object classification. 
10	We develop a practical and flexible computational model of fake news on social networks in which agents act according to learned best response functions. We achieve this by extending an information aggregation game to allow for fake news and by representing agents as recurrent deep Q-networks (DQN) trained by independent Q-learning. In the game, agents repeatedly guess whether a claim is true or false taking into account an informative private signal and observations of actions of their neighbors on the social network in the previous period. We incorporate fake news into the model by adding an adversarial agent, the attacker, that either provides biased private signals to or takes over a subset of agents. The attacker can follow either a hand-tuned or trained policy. Our model allows us to tackle questions that are analytically intractable in fully rational models, while ensuring that agents follow reasonable best response functions. Our results highlight the importance of awareness, privacy and social connectivity in curbing the adverse effects of fake news.
10	We propose a solution for evaluation of mathematical expression. However, instead of designing a single end-to-end model we propose a Lego bricks style architecture. In this architecture instead of training a complex end-to-end neural network, many small networks can be trained independently each accomplishing one specific operation and acting a single lego brick. More difficult or complex task can then be solved using a combination of these smaller network. In this work we first identify 8 fundamental operations that are commonly used to solve arithmetic operations (such as 1 digit multiplication, addition, subtraction, sign calculator etc). These fundamental operations are then learned using simple feed forward neural networks. We then shows that different operations can be designed simply by reusing these smaller networks. As an example we reuse these smaller networks to develop larger and a more complex network to solve n-digit multiplication, n-digit division, and cross product. This bottom-up strategy not only introduces reusability, we also show that it allows to generalize for computations involving n-digits and we show results for up to 7 digit numbers. Unlike existing methods, our solution also generalizes for both positive as well as negative numbers.
10	Most of the work on interpretable machine learning has focused on designingeither inherently interpretable models, which typically trade-off accuracyfor interpretability, or post-hoc explanation systems, which lack guarantees about their explanation quality.  We explore an alternative to theseapproaches by directly regularizing a black-box model for interpretabilityat training time.  Our approach explicitly connects three key aspects ofinterpretable machine learning:  (i) the model’s internal interpretability, (ii)the explanation system used at test time, and (iii) the metrics that measureexplanation quality.  Our regularization results in substantial improvementin terms of the explanation fidelity and stability metrics across a range ofdatasets and black-box explanation systems while slightly improving accuracy.  Finally, we justify theoretically that the benefits of our regularizationgeneralize to unseen points.
10	Recent work on bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) has frequently depended either on aligned bilingual lexicons or on distribution matching, often with an assumption about the isometry of the two spaces. We propose a technique to quantitatively estimate this assumption of the isometry between two embedding spaces and  empirically show that this assumption weakens as the languages in question become increasingly etymologically distant. We then propose Bilingual Lexicon Induction with Semi-Supervision (BLISS) --- a novel semi-supervised approach that relaxes the isometric assumption while leveraging both limited aligned bilingual lexicons and a larger set of unaligned word embeddings, as well as a novel hubness filtering technique. Our proposed method improves over strong baselines for 11 of 14 on the MUSE dataset, particularly for languages whose embedding spaces do not appear to be isometric. In addition, we also show that adding supervision stabilizes the learning procedure, and is effective even with minimal supervision.
10	Expectation learning is a continuous learning process which uses known multisensory bindings to modulate unisensory perception. When perceiving an event, we have an expectation on what we should see or hear which affects our unisensory perception. Expectation learning is known to enhance the unisensory perception of previously known multisensory events. In this work, we present a novel hybrid deep recurrent model based on audio/visual autoencoders, for unimodal stimulus representation and reconstruction, and a recurrent self-organizing network for multisensory binding of the representations. The model adapts concepts of expectation learning to enhance the unisensory representation based on the learned bindings.We demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of reconstructing signals from one modality by processing input of another modality for 43,500 Youtube videos in the animal subset of the AudioSet corpus. Our experiments also show that when using expectation learning, the proposed model presents state-of-the-art performance in representing and classifying unisensory stimuli.
01	Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) excel on many complex perceptual tasks but it has proven notoriously difficult to understand how they reach their decisions. We here introduce a high-performance DNN architecture on ImageNet whose decisions are considerably easier to explain. Our model, a simple variant of the ResNet-50 architecture called BagNet, classifies an image based on the occurrences of small local image features without taking into account their spatial ordering. This strategy is closely related to the bag-of-feature (BoF) models popular before the onset of deep learning and reaches a surprisingly high accuracy on ImageNet (87.6% top-5 for 32 x 32 px features and Alexnet performance for 16 x16 px features). The constraint on local features makes it straight-forward to analyse how exactly each part of the image influences the classification. Furthermore, the BagNets behave similar to state-of-the art deep neural networks such as VGG-16, ResNet-152 or DenseNet-169 in terms of feature sensitivity, error distribution and interactions between image parts. This suggests that the improvements of DNNs over previous bag-of-feature classifiers in the last few years is mostly achieved by better fine-tuning rather than by qualitatively different decision strategies.
01	Designing a convolution for a spherical neural network requires a delicate tradeoff between efficiency and rotation equivariance. DeepSphere, a method based on a graph representation of the discretized sphere, strikes a controllable balance between these two desiderata. This contribution is twofold. First, we study both theoretically and empirically how equivariance is affected by the underlying graph with respect to the number of pixels and neighbors. Second, we evaluate DeepSphere on relevant problems. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates the efficiency and flexibility of this formulation. Perhaps surprisingly, comparison with previous work suggests that anisotropic filters might be an unnecessary price to pay. Our code is available at https://github.com/deepsphere.
10	This paper presents a method to autonomously find periodicities in a signal. It is based on the same idea of using Fourier Transform and autocorrelation function presented in Vlachos et al. 2005. While showing interesting results this method does not perform well on noisy signals or signals with multiple periodicities. Thus, our method adds several new extra steps (hints clustering, filtering and detrending) to fix these issues. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art algorithms. 
10	Recently popularized graph neural networks achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on a number of standard benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning, improving significantly over existing approaches. These architectures alternate between a propagation layer that aggregates the hidden states of the local neighborhood and a fully-connected layer. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that a linear model, that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, is still able to achieve a performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models. This significantly reduces the number of parameters, which is critical for semi-supervised learning where number of labeled examples are small. This in turn allows a room for designing more innovative propagation layers. Based on this insight, we propose a novel graph neural network that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, and replaces the propagation layers with attention mechanisms that respect the structure of the graph. The attention mechanism allows us to learn a dynamic and adaptive local summary of the neighborhood to achieve more accurate predictions. In a number of experiments on benchmark citation networks datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing methods. By examining the attention weights among neighbors, we show that our model provides some interesting insights on how neighbors influence each other.
10	The most used recommendation method is collaborative filtering, and the key part of collaborative filtering is to compute the similarity. The similarity based on co-occurrence of similar event is easy to implement and can be applied to almost all the situation. So when the word2vec model reach the state-of-art at a lower computation cost in NLP. An correspond model in recommender system item2vec is proposed and reach state-of-art in recommender system. It is easy to see that the position of user and item is interchangeable when their count size gap is not too much, we proposed a user2vec model and show its performance. The similarity based on co-occurrence information suffers from cold start, we proposed a content based similarity model based on doc2vec which is another technology in NLP.
01	The goal of imitation learning (IL) is to enable a learner to imitate expert behavior given expert demonstrations. Recently, generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) has shown significant progress on IL for complex continuous tasks. However, GAIL and its extensions require a large number of environment interactions during training. In real-world environments, the more an IL method requires the learner to interact with the environment for better imitation, the more training time it requires, and the more damage it causes to the environments and the learner itself. We believe that IL algorithms could be more applicable to real-world problems if the number of interactions could be reduced. In this paper, we propose a model-free IL algorithm for continuous control. Our algorithm is made up mainly three changes to the existing adversarial imitation learning (AIL) methods – (a) adopting off-policy actor-critic (Off-PAC) algorithm to optimize the learner policy, (b) estimating the state-action value using off-policy samples without learning reward functions, and (c) representing the stochastic policy function so that its outputs are bounded. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves competitive results with GAIL while significantly reducing the environment interactions.
10	Despite the widespread interest in generative adversarial networks (GANs), few works have studied the metrics that quantitatively evaluate GANs' performance. In this paper, we revisit several representative sample-based evaluation metrics for GANs, and address the important problem of \emph{how to evaluate the evaluation metrics}. We start with a few necessary conditions for metrics to produce meaningful scores, such as distinguishing real from generated samples, identifying mode dropping and mode collapsing, and detecting overfitting. Then with a series of carefully designed experiments,  we are able to comprehensively investigate existing sample-based metrics and identify their strengths and limitations in practical settings. Based on these results, we observe that kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the 1-Nearest-Neighbour (1-NN) two-sample test seem to satisfy most of the desirable properties, provided that the distances between samples are computed in a suitable feature space. Our experiments also unveil interesting properties about the behavior of several popular GAN models, such as whether they are memorizing training samples, and how far these state-of-the-art GANs are from perfect.
01	Group convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) can be used to improve classical CNNs by equipping them with the geometric structure of groups. Central in the success of G-CNNs is the lifting of feature maps to higher dimensional disentangled representations, in which data characteristics are effectively learned, geometric data-augmentations are made obsolete, and predictable behavior under geometric transformations (equivariance) is guaranteed via group theory. Currently, however, the practical implementations of G-CNNs are limited to either discrete groups (that leave the grid intact) or continuous compact groups such as rotations (that enable the use of Fourier theory). In this paper we lift these limitations and propose a modular framework for the design and implementation of G-CNNs for arbitrary Lie groups. In our approach the differential structure of Lie groups is used to expand convolution kernels in a generic basis of B-splines that is defined on the Lie algebra. This leads to a flexible framework that enables localized, atrous, and deformable convolutions in G-CNNs by means of respectively localized, sparse and non-uniform B-spline expansions. The impact and potential of our approach is studied on two benchmark datasets: cancer detection in histopathology slides (PCam dataset) in which rotation equivariance plays a key role and facial landmark localization (CelebA dataset) in which scale equivariance is important. In both cases, G-CNN architectures outperform their classical 2D counterparts and the added value of atrous and localized group convolutions is studied in detail.
10	We present the ADaptive Adversarial Imitation Learning (ADAIL) algorithm for learning adaptive policies that can be transferred between environments of varying dynamics, by imitating a small number of demonstrations collected from a single source domain. This problem is important in robotic learning because in real world scenarios 1) reward functions are hard to obtain, 2) learned policies from one domain are difficult to deploy in another due to varying source to target domain statistics, 3) collecting expert demonstrations in multiple environments where the dynamics are known and controlled is often infeasible. We address these constraints by building upon recent advances in adversarial imitation learning; we condition our policy on a learned dynamics embedding and we employ a domain-adversarial loss to learn a dynamics-invariant discriminator. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on simulated control tasks with varying environment dynamics and the learned adaptive agent outperforms several recent baselines.
10	A common way to speed up training of large convolutional networks is to add  computational units. Training is then performed using data-parallel synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a mini-batch divided between computational units. With an increase in the number of nodes, the batch size grows. However,  training with a large batch  often results in lower model accuracy. We argue that the current recipe for large batch training (linear learning rate scaling with warm-up) is not general enough and training may diverge. To overcome these optimization difficulties, we propose a new training algorithm based on Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS). Using LARS, we scaled AlexNet  and ResNet-50 to a batch size of 16K.
10	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for prediction tasks like node classification or edge prediction have received increasing attention in recent machine learning from graphically structured data. However, a large quantity of labeled graphs is difficult to obtain, which significantly limit the true success of GNNs. Although active learning has been widely studied for addressing label-sparse issues with other data types like text, images, etc., how to make it effective over graphs is an open question for research.  In this paper, we present the investigation on active learning with GNNs for node classification tasks.  Specifically, we propose a new method, which uses node feature propagation followed by K-Medoids clustering of the nodes for instance selection in active learning. With a theoretical bound analysis we justify the design choice of our approach. In our experiments on four benchmark dataset, the proposed method outperforms other representative baseline methods consistently and significantly.
01	Human perception of 3D shapes goes beyond reconstructing them as a set of points or a composition of geometric primitives: we also effortlessly understand higher-level shape structure such as the repetition and reflective symmetry of object parts. In contrast, recent advances in 3D shape sensing focus more on low-level geometry but less on these higher-level relationships. In this paper, we propose 3D shape programs, integrating bottom-up recognition systems with top-down, symbolic program structure to capture both low-level geometry and high-level structural priors for 3D shapes. Because there are no annotations of shape programs for real shapes, we develop neural modules that not only learn to infer 3D shape programs from raw, unannotated shapes, but also to execute these programs for shape reconstruction. After initial bootstrapping, our end-to-end differentiable model learns 3D shape programs by reconstructing shapes in a self-supervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that our model accurately infers and executes 3D shape programs for highly complex shapes from various categories. It can also be integrated with an image-to-shape module to infer 3D shape programs directly from an RGB image, leading to 3D shape reconstructions that are both more accurate and more physically plausible.
10	"Current knowledge distillation methods require full training data to distill knowledge from a large ""teacher"" network to a compact ""student"" network by matching certain statistics between ""teacher"" and ""student"" such as softmax outputs and feature responses. This is not only time-consuming but also inconsistent with human cognition in which children can learn knowledge from adults with few examples. This paper proposes a novel and simple method for knowledge distillation from few samples. Taking the assumption that both ""teacher"" and ""student"" have the same  feature map sizes at each corresponding block, we add a $1\times 1$ conv-layer at the end of each block in the student-net, and align the block-level outputs between ""teacher"" and ""student"" by estimating the parameters of the added layer with limited samples. We prove that the added layer can be absorbed/merged into the previous conv-layer \hl{to formulate a new conv-layer with the same size of parameters and computation cost as previous one. Experiments verifies that the proposed method is very efficient and effective to distill knowledge from teacher-net to student-net constructing in different ways on various datasets."
10	Recent improvements in large-scale language models have driven progress on automatic generation of syntactically and semantically consistent text for many real-world applications. Many of these advances leverage the availability of large corpora. While training on such corpora encourages the model to understand long-range dependencies in text, it can also result in the models internalizing the social biases present in the corpora. This paper aims to quantify and reduce biases exhibited by language models. Given a conditioning context (e.g. a writing prompt) and a language model, we analyze if (and how) the sentiment of the generated text is affected by changes in values of sensitive attributes (e.g. country names, occupations, genders, etc.) in the conditioning context, a.k.a. counterfactual evaluation. We quantify these biases by adapting individual and group fairness metrics from the fair machine learning literature. Extensive evaluation on two different corpora (news articles and Wikipedia) shows that state-of-the-art Transformer-based language models exhibit biases learned from data. We propose embedding-similarity and sentiment-similarity regularization methods that improve both individual and group fairness metrics without sacrificing perplexity and semantic similarity---a positive step toward development and deployment of fairer language models for real-world applications.
01	Options in reinforcement learning allow agents to hierarchically decompose a task into subtasks, having the potential to speed up learning and planning. However, autonomously learning effective sets of options is still a major challenge in the field. In this paper we focus on the recently introduced idea of using representation learning methods to guide the option discovery process. Specifically, we look at eigenoptions, options obtained from representations that encode diffusive information flow in the environment. We extend the existing algorithms for eigenoption discovery to settings with stochastic transitions and in which handcrafted features are not available.  We propose an algorithm that discovers eigenoptions while learning non-linear state representations from raw pixels. It exploits recent successes in the deep reinforcement learning literature and the equivalence between proto-value functions and the successor representation. We use traditional tabular domains to provide intuition about our approach and Atari 2600 games to demonstrate its potential.
10	Trained generative models have shown remarkable performance as priors for inverse problems in imaging.  For example, Generative Adversarial Network priors permit recovery of test images from 5-10x fewer measurements than sparsity priors.  Unfortunately, these models may be unable to represent any particular image because of architectural choices, mode collapse, and bias in the training dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that invertible neural networks, which have zero representation error by design, can be effective natural signal priors at inverse problems such as denoising, compressive sensing, and inpainting.   Our formulation is an empirical risk minimization that does not directly optimize the likelihood of images, as one would expect.  Instead we optimize the likelihood of the latent representation of images as a proxy, as this is empirically easier.For compressive sensing, our formulation can yield higher accuracy than sparsity priors across almost all undersampling ratios.  For the same accuracy on test images, they can use 10-20x fewer measurements.  We demonstrate that invertible priors can yield better reconstructions than sparsity priors for images that have rare features of variation within the biased training set, including out-of-distribution natural images.  
01	While there are convergence guarantees for temporal difference (TD) learning when using linear function approximators, the situation for nonlinear models is far less understood, and divergent examples are known. Here we take a first step towards extending theoretical convergence guarantees to TD learning with nonlinear function approximation. More precisely, we consider the expected learning dynamics of the TD(0) algorithm for value estimation. As the step-size converges to zero, these dynamics are defined by a nonlinear ODE which depends on the geometry of the space of function approximators, the structure of the underlying Markov chain, and their interaction. We find a set of function approximators that includes ReLU networks and has geometry amenable to TD learning regardless of environment, so that the solution performs about as well as linear TD in the worst case. Then, we show how environments that are more reversible induce dynamics that are better for TD learning and prove global convergence to the true value function for well-conditioned function approximators. Finally, we generalize a divergent counterexample to a family of divergent problems to demonstrate how the interaction between approximator and environment can go wrong and to motivate the assumptions needed to prove convergence. 
10	High-dimensional sparse reward tasks present major challenges for reinforcement learning agents.  In this work we use imitation learning to address two of these challenges:  how to learn a useful representation of the world e.g.  from pixels, and how to explore efficiently given the rarity of a reward signal? We show that adversarial imitation can work well even in this high dimensional observation space. Surprisingly the adversary itself, acting as the learned reward function, can be tiny, comprising as few as 128 parameters, and can be easily trained using the most basic GAN formulation. Our approach removes limitations present in most contemporary imitation approaches: requiring no demonstrator actions (only video), no special initial conditions or warm starts, and no explicit tracking of any single demo. The proposed agent can solve a challenging robot manipulation task of block stacking from only video demonstrations and sparse reward, in which the non-imitating agents fail to learn completely.  Furthermore, our agent learns much faster than competing approaches that depend on hand-crafted, staged dense reward functions, and also better compared to standard GAIL baselines. Finally, we develop a new adversarial goal recognizer that in some cases allows the agent to learn stacking without any task reward, purely from imitation.
10	Existing methods for AI-generated artworks still struggle with generating high-quality stylized content, where high-level semantics are preserved, or separating fine-grained styles from various artists. We propose a novel Generative Adversarial Disentanglement Network which can disentangle two complementary factors of variations when only one of them is labelled in general, and fully decompose complex anime illustrations into style and content in particular. Training such model is challenging, since given a style, various content data may exist but not the other way round. Our approach is divided into two stages, one that encodes an input image into a style independent content, and one based on a dual-conditional generator. We demonstrate the ability to generate high-fidelity anime portraits with a fixed content and a large variety of styles from over a thousand artists, and vice versa, using a single end-to-end network and with applications in style transfer. We show this unique capability as well as superior output to the current state-of-the-art.
01	We propose BERTScore, an automatic evaluation metric for text generation. Analogously to common metrics, BERTScore computes a similarity score for each token in the candidate sentence with each token in the reference sentence. However, instead of exact matches, we compute token similarity using contextual embeddings. We evaluate using the outputs of 363 machine translation and image captioning systems. BERTScore correlates better with human judgments and provides stronger model selection performance than existing metrics. Finally, we use an adversarial paraphrase detection task and show that BERTScore is more robust to challenging examples compared to existing metrics. 
01	We introduce a novel method that enables parameter-efficient transfer and multi-task learning with deep neural networks. The basic approach is to learn a model patch - a small set of parameters - that will specialize to each task, instead of fine-tuning the last layer or the entire network. For instance, we show that learning a set of scales and biases is sufficient to convert a pretrained network to perform well on qualitatively different problems (e.g. converting a Single Shot MultiBox Detection (SSD) model into a 1000-class image classification model while reusing 98% of parameters of the SSD feature extractor). Similarly, we show that re-learning existing low-parameter layers (such as depth-wise convolutions) while keeping the rest of the network frozen also improves transfer-learning accuracy significantly. Our approach allows both simultaneous (multi-task) as well as sequential transfer learning. In several multi-task learning problems, despite using much fewer parameters than traditional logits-only fine-tuning, we match single-task performance. 
10	A variety of learning objectives have been recently proposed for training generative models. We show that many of them, including InfoGAN, ALI/BiGAN, ALICE, CycleGAN, VAE, $\beta$-VAE, adversarial autoencoders, AVB, and InfoVAE, are Lagrangian duals of the same primal optimization problem. This generalization reveals the implicit modeling trade-offs  between flexibility and  computational requirements being made by these models. Furthermore, we characterize the class of all objectives that can be optimized under certain computational constraints.Finally, we show how this new Lagrangian perspective can explain undesirable behavior of existing methods and provide new principled solutions.
10	"Neural architecture search (NAS), or automated design of neural network models, remains a very challenging meta-learning problem. Several recent works (called ""one-shot"" approaches) have focused on dramatically reducing NAS running time by leveraging proxy models that still provide architectures with competitive performance. In our work, we propose a new meta-learning algorithm that we call CoNAS, or Compressive sensing-based Neural Architecture Search. Our approach merges ideas from one-shot NAS approaches with iterative techniques for learning low-degree sparse Boolean polynomial functions. We validate our approach on several standard test datasets, discover novel architectures hitherto unreported, and achieve competitive (or better) results in both performance and search time compared to existing NAS approaches. Further, we provide theoretical analysis via upper bounds on the number of validation error measurements needed to perform reliable meta-learning; to our knowledge, these analysis tools are novel to the NAS literature and may be of independent interest."
10	Designing accurate and efficient convolutional neural architectures for vast amount of hardware is challenging because hardware designs are complex and diverse. This paper addresses the hardware diversity challenge in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Unlike previous approaches that apply search algorithms on a small, human-designed search space without considering hardware diversity, we propose HURRICANE that explores the automatic hardware-aware search over a much larger search space and a multistep search scheme in coordinate ascent framework, to generate tailored models for different types of hardware. Extensive experiments on  ImageNet show that our algorithm consistently achieves a much lower inference latency with a similar or better accuracy than state-of-the-art NAS methods on three types of hardware. Remarkably, HURRICANE achieves a 76.63% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a inference latency of only 16.5 ms for DSP, which is a 3.4% higher accuracy and a 6.35x inference speedup than FBNet-iPhoneX. For VPU, HURRICANE achieves a 0.53% higher top-1 accuracy than Proxyless-mobile with a 1.49x speedup. Even for well-studied mobile CPU, HURRICANE achieves a 1.63% higher top-1  accuracy than FBNet-iPhoneX with a comparable inference latency. HURRICANE also reduces the training time by 54.7% on average compared to SinglePath-Oneshot.
10	Statistical generative models for molecular graphs attract attention from many researchers from the fields of bio- and chemo-informatics. Among these models, invertible flow-based approaches are not fully explored yet. In this paper, we propose a powerful invertible flow for molecular graphs, called Graph Residual Flow (GRF). The GRF is based on residual flows, which are known for more flexible and complex non-linear mappings than traditional coupling flows. We theoretically derive non-trivial conditions such that GRF is invertible, and present a way of keeping the entire flows invertible throughout the training and sampling. Experimental results show that a generative model based on the proposed GRF achieve comparable generation performance, with much smaller number of trainable parameters compared to the existing flow-based model. 
01	Training a classifier over a large number of classes, known as 'extreme classification', has become a topic of major interest with applications in technology, science, and e-commerce. Traditional softmax regression induces a gradient cost proportional to the number of classes C, which often is prohibitively expensive. A popular scalable softmax approximation relies on uniform negative sampling, which suffers from slow convergence due a poor signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a simple training method for drastically enhancing the gradient signal by drawing negative samples from an adversarial model that mimics the data distribution. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) an adversarial sampling mechanism that produces negative samples at a cost only logarithmic in C, thus still resulting in cheap gradient updates; (ii) a mathematical proof that this adversarial sampling minimizes the gradient variance while any bias due to non-uniform sampling can be removed; (iii) experimental results on large scale data sets that show a reduction of the training time by an order of magnitude relative to several competitive baselines.
01	We describe a new training methodology for generative adversarial networks. The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.
10	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful tools for realistic image generation. However, a major drawback of GANs is that they are especially hard to train, often requiring large amounts of data and long training time. In this paper we propose the Deli-Fisher GAN, a GAN that generates photo-realistic images by enforcing structure on the latent generative space using similar approaches in \cite{deligan}. The structure of the latent space we consider in this paper is modeled as a mixture of Gaussians, whose parameters are learned in the training process. Furthermore, to improve stability and efficiency, we use the Fisher Integral Probability Metric as the divergence measure in our GAN model, instead of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. We show by experiments that the Deli-Fisher GAN performs better than DCGAN, WGAN, and the Fisher GAN as measured by inception score.
10	We introduce Neural Markov Logic Networks (NMLNs), a statistical relational learning system that borrows ideas from Markov logic. Like Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), NMLNs are an exponential-family model for modelling distributions over possible worlds, but unlike MLNs, they do not rely on explicitly specified first-order logic rules. Instead, NMLNs learn an implicit representation of such rules as a neural network that acts as a potential function on fragments of the relational structure. Interestingly, any MLN can be represented as an NMLN. Similarly to recently proposed Neural theorem provers (NTPs) (Rocktaschel at al. 2017), NMLNs can exploit embeddings of constants but, unlike NTPs, NMLNs work well also in their absence. This is extremely important for predicting in settings other than the transductive one. We showcase the potential of NMLNs on knowledge-base completion tasks and on generation of molecular (graph) data.
10	Semantic parsing is the problem of deriving machine interpretable meaning representations from natural language utterances. Neural models with encoder-decoder architectures have recently achieved substantial improvements over traditional methods. Although neural semantic parsers appear to have relatively high recall using large beam sizes, there is room for improvement with respect to one-best precision. In this work, we propose a generator-reranker architecture for semantic parsing. The generator produces a list of potential candidates and the reranker, which consists of a pre-processing step for the candidates followed by a novel critic network, reranks these candidates based on the similarity between each candidate and the input sentence. We show the advantages of this approach along with how it improves the parsing performance through extensive analysis. We experiment our model on three semantic parsing datasets (GEO, ATIS, and OVERNIGHT). The overall architecture achieves the state-of-the-art results in all three datasets. 
10	The information bottleneck principle (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017) suggests that SGD-based training of deep neural networks results in optimally compressed hidden layers, from an information theoretic perspective. However, this claim was established on toy data. The goal of the work we present here is to test these claims in a realistic setting using a larger and deeper convolutional architecture, a ResNet model. We trained PixelCNN++ models as inverse representation decoders to measure the mutual information between hidden layers of a ResNet and input image data, when trained for (1) classification and (2) autoencoding. We find that two stages of learning happen for both training regimes, and that compression does occur, even for an autoencoder. Sampling images by conditioning on hidden layers’ activations offers an intuitive visualisation to understand what a ResNets learns to forget.
10	A plethora of methods attempting to explain predictions of black-box models have been proposed by the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) community. Yet, measuring the quality of the generated explanations is largely unexplored, making quantitative comparisons non-trivial. In this work, we propose a suite of multifaceted metrics that enables us to objectively compare explainers based on the correctness, consistency, as well as the confidence of the generated explanations. These metrics are computationally inexpensive, do not require model-retraining and can be used across different data modalities. We evaluate them on common explainers such as Grad-CAM, SmoothGrad, LIME and Integrated Gradients. Our experiments show that the proposed metrics reflect qualitative observations reported in earlier works.
10	Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to model black-box functions. Examples include modeling brain response to stimuli, material properties under given synthesis conditions, and digital art. In these applications, often the model is a surrogate and the goal is rather to optimize the black-box function to achieve the desired brain response, material property, or digital art characteristics. Moreover, resource constraints imply that, rather than training on a passive dataset, one should focus subsequent sampling on the most informative data points. In the Bayesian setting, this can be achieved by utilizing the ability of Bayesian models such as Gaussian processes to model uncertainty in observed data via posterior variance, which can guide subsequent sampling. However, uncertainty estimates for deep neural networks are largely lacking or are very expensive to compute. For example, bootstrap or cross-validation estimates require re-training the network several times which is often computationally prohibitive. In this work, we use influence functions to estimate the variance of neural network outputs, and design a black-box optimization algorithm similar to confidence bound-based Bayesian algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on synthetic and real-world optimization problems.
01	Large deep neural networks are powerful, but exhibit undesirable behaviors such as memorization and sensitivity to adversarial examples. In this work, we propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels.  By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples.  Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures.  We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt labels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the training of generative adversarial networks.
10	The Boltzmann softmax operator can trade-off well between exploration and exploitation according to current estimation in an exponential weighting scheme, which is a promising way to address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, the Boltzmann softmax operator is not a non-expansion, which may lead to unstable or even divergent learning behavior when used in estimating the value function. The non-expansion is a vital and widely-used sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence of value iteration. However, how to characterize the effect of such non-expansive operators in value iteration remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a new technique to analyze the error bound of value iteration with the the Boltzmann softmax operator. We then propose the dynamic Boltzmann softmax(DBS) operator to enable the convergence to the optimal value function in value iteration.  We also present convergence rate analysis of the algorithm.Using Q-learning as an application, we show that the DBS operator can be applied in a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DBS operator in a toy problem called GridWorld and a suite of Atari games. Experimental results show that outperforms DQN substantially in benchmark games.
10	Many recently proposed methods for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can be formulated as bilevel optimization. For efficient implementation, its solution requires approximations of second-order methods. In this paper, we demonstrate that gradient errors caused by such approximation leads to suboptimality, in that such a procedure fails to converge to a (locally) optimal solution. To remedy this problem, this paper proposes MiLeNAS, a mixed-level reformulation for Neural Architecture Search that can be optimized more reliably. It is shown that even when using a simple first-order method on mixed-level formulation, MiLeNAS can achieve lower validation error for NAS problems. Consequently, architectures obtained by our method achieve consistently higher accuracies than those obtained from bilevel optimization. Moreover, the use of first-order updates in our method also leads to faster training. Extensive experiments within convolutional architecture search space validate the effectiveness of our approach. 
10	The problem of accelerating drug discovery relies heavily on automatic tools to optimize precursor molecules to afford them with better biochemical properties. Our work in this paper substantially extends prior state-of-the-art on graph-to-graph translation methods for molecular optimization. In particular, we realize coherent multi-resolution representations by interweaving the encoding of substructure components with the atom-level encoding of the original molecular graph. Moreover, our graph decoder is fully autoregressive, and interleaves each step of adding a new substructure with the process of resolving its attachment to the emerging molecule. We evaluate our model on multiple molecular optimization tasks and show that our model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines.
10	Training neural networks on image datasets generally require extensive experimentation to find the optimal learning rate regime. Especially, for the cases of adversarial training or for training a newly synthesized model, one would not know the best learning rate regime beforehand. We propose an automated algorithm for determining the learning rate trajectory, that works across datasets and models for both natural and adversarial training, without requiring any dataset/model specific tuning. It is a stand-alone, parameterless, adaptive approach with no computational overhead. We theoretically discuss the algorithm's convergence behavior. We empirically validate our algorithm extensively. Our results show that our proposed approach \emph{consistently} achieves top-level accuracy compared to SOTA baselines in the literature in natural training, as well as in adversarial training.
10	Temporal Difference learning with function approximation has been widely used recently and has led to several successful results.  However, compared with the original tabular-based methods, one major drawback of temporal difference learning with neural networks and other function approximators is that they tend to over-generalize across temporally successive states, resulting in slow convergence and even instability. In this work, we propose a novel TD learning method, Hadamard product Regularized TD (HR-TD), that reduces over-generalization and thus leads to faster convergence. This approach can be easily applied to both linear and nonlinear function approximators. HR-TD is evaluated on several linear and nonlinear benchmark domains, where we show improvement in learning behavior and performance.
10	During the last years, a remarkable breakthrough has been made in AI domainthanks to artificial deep neural networks that achieved a great success in manymachine learning tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, speechrecognition, malware detection and so on. However, they are highly vulnerableto easily crafted adversarial examples. Many investigations have pointed out thisfact and different approaches have been proposed to generate attacks while addinga limited perturbation to the original data. The most robust known method so faris the so called C&W attack [1]. Nonetheless, a countermeasure known as fea-ture squeezing coupled with ensemble defense showed that most of these attackscan be destroyed [6]. In this paper, we present a new method we call CenteredInitial Attack (CIA) whose advantage is twofold : first, it insures by construc-tion the maximum perturbation to be smaller than a threshold fixed beforehand,without the clipping process that degrades the quality of attacks. Second, it isrobust against recently introduced defenses such as feature squeezing, JPEG en-coding and even against a voting ensemble of defenses. While its application isnot limited to images, we illustrate this using five of the current best classifierson ImageNet dataset among which two are adversarialy retrained on purpose tobe robust against attacks. With a fixed maximum perturbation of only 1.5% onany pixel, around 80% of attacks (targeted) fool the voting ensemble defense andnearly 100% when the perturbation is only 6%. While this shows how it is difficultto defend against CIA attacks, the last section of the paper gives some guidelinesto limit their impact.
10	Various methods of measuring unit selectivity have been developed in order to understand the representations learned by neural networks (NNs).  Here we undertake a comparison of four such measures on AlexNet, namely, localist selectivity, \precision (Zhou et al, ICLR 2015), class-conditional mean activity selectivity CCMAS; (Morcos et al, ICLR 2018), and a new measure called top-class selectivity. In contrast with previous work on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we fail to find any 100\% selective `localist units' in AlexNet, and demonstrate that the \precision and CCMAS measures provide a much higher level of selectivity than is warranted, with the most selective hidden units only responding strongly to a small minority of images from within a category. We also generated activation maximization (AM) images that maximally activated individual units and found that under (5\%) of units in fc6 and conv5 produced interpretable images of objects, whereas fc8 produced over 50\% interpretable images. Furthermore, the interpretable images in the hidden layers were not associated with highly selective units. These findings highlight the problem with current selectivity measures and show that new measures are required in order to provide a better assessment of learned representations in NNs.  We also consider why localist representations are learned in RNNs and not AlexNet.
10	Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown an impressive ability to learn complex control policies in high-dimensional environments. However, despite the ever-increasing performance on popular benchmarks like the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), policies learned by deep RL algorithms can struggle to generalize when evaluated in remarkably similar environments. These results are unexpected given the fact that, in supervised learning, deep neural networks often learn robust features that generalize across tasks. In this paper, we study the generalization capabilities of DQN in order to aid in understanding this mismatch between generalization in deep RL and supervised learning methods. We provide evidence suggesting that DQN overspecializes to the domain it is trained on. We then comprehensively evaluate the impact of traditional methods of regularization from supervised learning, $\ell_2$ and dropout, and of reusing learned representations to improve the generalization capabilities of DQN. We perform this study using different game modes of Atari 2600 games, a recently introduced modification for the ALE which supports slight variations of the Atari 2600 games used for benchmarking in the field. Despite regularization being largely underutilized in deep RL, we show that it can, in fact, help DQN learn more general features. These features can then be reused and fine-tuned on similar tasks, considerably improving the sample efficiency of DQN.
