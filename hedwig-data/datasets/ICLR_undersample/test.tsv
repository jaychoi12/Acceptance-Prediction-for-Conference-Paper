10	In this paper, we propose a nonlinear unsupervised metric learning framework to boost of the performance of clustering algorithms. Under our framework, nonlinear distance metric learning and manifold embedding are integrated and conducted simultaneously to increase the natural separations among data samples. The metric learning component is implemented through feature space transformations, regulated by a nonlinear deformable model called Coherent Point Drifting (CPD). Driven by CPD, data points can get to a higher level of linear separability, which is subsequently picked up by the manifold embedding component to generate well-separable sample projections for clustering. Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art solutions in unsupervised metric learning.
10	Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely adopted in real-world cognitive applications because of their high accuracy. The robustness of DNN models, however, has been recently challenged by adversarial attacks where small disturbance on input samples may result in misclassification. State-of-the-art defending algorithms, such as adversarial training or robust optimization, improve DNNs' resilience to adversarial attacks by paying high computational costs. Moreover, these approaches are usually designed to defend one or a few known attacking techniques only. The effectiveness to defend other types of attacking methods, especially those that have not yet been discovered or explored, cannot be guaranteed. This work aims for a general approach of enhancing the robustness of DNN models under adversarial attacks. In particular, we propose Bamboo -- the first data augmentation method designed for improving the general robustness of DNN without any hypothesis on the attacking algorithms. Bamboo augments the training data set with a small amount of data uniformly sampled on a fixed radius ball around each training data and hence, effectively increase the distance between natural data points and decision boundary. Our experiments show that Bamboo substantially improve the general robustness against arbitrary types of attacks and noises, achieving better results comparing to previous adversarial training methods, robust optimization methods and other data augmentation methods with the same amount of data points.
10	Modeling dynamically-evolving, multi-relational graph data has received a surge of interests with the rapid growth of heterogeneous event data. However, predicting future events on such data requires global structure inference over time and the ability to integrate temporal and structural information, which are not yet well understood. We present Recurrent Event Network (RE-Net), a novel autoregressive architecture for modeling temporal sequences of multi-relational graphs (e.g., temporal knowledge graph), which can perform sequential, global structure inference over future time stamps to predict new events. RE-Net employs a recurrent event encoder to model the temporally conditioned joint probability distribution for the event sequences, and equips the event encoder with a neighborhood aggregator for modeling the concurrent events within a time window associated with each entity. We apply teacher forcing for model training over historical data, and infer graph sequences over future time stamps by sampling from the learned joint distribution in a sequential manner. We evaluate the proposed method via temporal link prediction on Ô¨Åve public datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength of RE-Net, especially on multi-step inference over future time stamps.
10	Mixture models, a basic building block in countless statistical models, involve latent random variables over discrete spaces, and existing posterior inference methods can be inaccurate and/or very slow.  In this work we introduce a novel deep learning architecture for efficient amortized Bayesian inference over mixture models. While previous approaches to amortized clustering assumed a fixed or maximum number of mixture components and only amortized over the continuous parameters of each mixture component, our method amortizes over the local discrete labels of all the data points, and performs inference over an unbounded number of mixture components. The latter property makes our method natural for the challenging case of nonparametric Bayesian models, where the number of mixture components grows with the dataset. Our approach exploits the exchangeability of the generative models and is based on mapping distributed, permutation-invariant representations of discrete  arrangements into varying-size multinomial conditional probabilities. The resulting algorithm parallelizes easily, yields iid samples from the approximate posteriors along with a normalized probability estimate of each sample (a quantity generally unavailable using Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and can easily be applied to both conjugate and non-conjugate models, as training only requires samples from the generative model. We also present an extension of the method to models of random communities (such as infinite relational or stochastic block models). As a scientific application, we present a novel approach to neural spike sorting for high-density multielectrode arrays. 
10	Pre-trained models have demonstrated their effectiveness in many downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The availability of multilingual pre-trained models enables zero-shot transfer of NLP tasks from high resource languages to low resource ones. However, recent research in improving pre-trained models focuses heavily on English. While it is possible to train the latest neural architectures for other languages from scratch, it is undesirable due to the required amount of compute. In this work, we tackle the problem of transferring an existing pre-trained model from English to other languages under a limited computational budget. With a single GPU, our approach can obtain a foreign BERT-base model within a day and a foreign BERT-large within two days. Furthermore, evaluating our models on six languages, we demonstrate that our models are better than multilingual BERT on two zero-shot tasks: natural language inference and dependency parsing.
01	Generative adversarial networks (GANs) form a generative modeling approach known for producing appealing samples, but they are notably difficult to train. One common way to tackle this issue has been to propose new formulations of the GAN objective. Yet, surprisingly few studies have looked at optimization methods designed for this adversarial training. In this work, we cast GAN optimization problems in the general variational inequality framework. Tapping into the mathematical programming literature, we counter some common misconceptions about the difficulties of saddle point optimization and propose to extend methods designed for variational inequalities to the training of GANs. We apply averaging, extrapolation and a computationally cheaper variant that we call extrapolation from the past to the stochastic gradient method (SGD) and Adam.
10	This paper proposes a novel per-task routing method for multi-task applications. Multi-task neural networks can learn to transfer knowledge across different tasks by using parameter sharing. However, sharing parameters between unrelated tasks can hurt performance. To address this issue, routing networks can be applied to learn to share each group of parameters with a different subset of tasks to better leverage tasks relatedness. However, this use of routing methods requires to address the challenge of learning the routing jointly with the parameters of a modular multi-task neural network. We propose the Gumbel-Matrix routing, a novel multi-task routing method based on the Gumbel-Softmax, that is designed to learn fine-grained parameter sharing. When applied to the Omniglot benchmark, the proposed method improves the state-of-the-art error rate by 17%.
10	Supervised learning with irregularly sampled time series have been a challenge to Machine Learning methods due to the obstacle of dealing with irregular time intervals. Some papers introduced recently recurrent neural network models that deals with irregularity, but most of them rely on complex mechanisms to achieve a better performance. This work propose a novel method to represent timestamps (hours or dates) as dense vectors using sinusoidal functions, called Time Embeddings. As a data input method it and can be applied to most machine learning models. The method was evaluated with two predictive tasks from MIMIC III, a dataset of irregularly sampled time series of electronic health records. Our tests showed an improvement to LSTM-based and classical machine learning models, specially with very irregular data.
01	The unconditional generation of high fidelity images is a longstanding benchmarkfor testing the performance of image decoders. Autoregressive image modelshave been able to generate small images unconditionally, but the extension ofthese methods to large images where fidelity can be more readily assessed hasremained an open problem. Among the major challenges are the capacity to encodethe vast previous context and the sheer difficulty of learning a distribution thatpreserves both global semantic coherence and exactness of detail. To address theformer challenge, we propose the Subscale Pixel Network (SPN), a conditionaldecoder architecture that generates an image as a sequence of image slices of equalsize. The SPN compactly captures image-wide spatial dependencies and requires afraction of the memory and the computation. To address the latter challenge, wepropose to use multidimensional upscaling to grow an image in both size and depthvia intermediate stages corresponding to distinct SPNs. We evaluate SPNs on theunconditional generation of CelebAHQ of size 256 and of ImageNet from size 32to 128. We achieve state-of-the-art likelihood results in multiple settings, set upnew benchmark results in previously unexplored settings and are able to generatevery high fidelity large scale samples on the basis of both datasets.
01	Audio signals are sampled at high temporal resolutions, and learning to synthesize audio requires capturing structure across a range of timescales. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have seen wide success at generating images that are both locally and globally coherent, but they have seen little application to audio generation. In this paper we introduce WaveGAN, a first attempt at applying GANs to unsupervised synthesis of raw-waveform audio. WaveGAN is capable of synthesizing one second slices of audio waveforms with global coherence, suitable for sound effect generation. Our experiments demonstrate that‚Äîwithout labels‚ÄîWaveGAN learns to produce intelligible words when trained on a small-vocabulary speech dataset, and can also synthesize audio from other domains such as drums, bird vocalizations, and piano. We compare WaveGAN to a method which applies GANs designed for image generation on image-like audio feature representations, finding both approaches to be promising.
10	Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been the dominant optimization method for training deep neural networks due to its many desirable properties. One of the more remarkable and least understood quality of SGD is that it generalizes relatively wellon unseen data even when the neural network has millions of parameters. We hypothesize that in certain cases it is desirable to relax its intrinsic generalization properties and introduce an extension of SGD called deep gradient boosting (DGB). The key idea of DGB is that back-propagated gradients inferred using the chain rule can be viewed as pseudo-residual targets of a gradient boosting problem. Thus at each layer of a neural network the weight update is calculated by solving the corresponding boosting problem using a linear base learner. The resulting weight update formula can also be viewed as a normalization procedure of the data that arrives at each layer during the forward pass. When implemented as a separate input normalization layer (INN) the new architecture shows improved performance on image recognition tasks when compared to the same architecture without normalization layers. As opposed to batch normalization (BN), INN has no learnable parameters however it matches its performance on CIFAR10 and ImageNet classification tasks.
01	Text generation is ubiquitous in many NLP tasks, from summarization, to dialogue and machine translation. The dominant parametric approach is based on locally normalized models which predict one word at a time. While these work remarkably well, they are plagued by exposure bias due to the greedy nature of the generation process. In this work, we investigate un-normalized energy-based models (EBMs) which operate not at the token but at the sequence level. In order to make training tractable, we first work in the residual of a pretrained locally normalized language model and second we train using noise contrastive estimation. Furthermore, since the EBM works at the sequence level, we can leverage pretrained bi-directional contextual representations, such as BERT and RoBERTa. Our experiments on two large language modeling datasets show that residual EBMs yield lower perplexity compared to locally normalized baselines. Moreover, generation via importance sampling is very efficient and of higher quality than the baseline models according to human evaluation.
10	Despite the eminent successes of deep neural networks, many architectures are often hard to transfer to irregularly-sampled and asynchronous time series that occur in many real-world datasets, such as healthcare applications. This paper proposes a novel framework for classifying irregularly sampled time series with unaligned measurements, focusing on high scalability and data efficiency.Our method SeFT (Set Functions for Time Series) is based on recent advances in differentiable set function learning, extremely parallelizable, and scales well to very large datasets and online monitoring scenarios.We extensively compare our method to competitors on multiple healthcare time series datasets and show that it performs competitively whilst significantly reducing runtime.
01	Deep generative models have been enjoying success in modeling continuous data. However it remains challenging to capture the representations for discrete structures with formal grammars and semantics, e.g., computer programs and molecular structures. How to generate both syntactically and semantically correct data still remains largely an open problem. Inspired by the theory of compiler where syntax and semantics check is done via syntax-directed translation (SDT), we propose a novel syntax-directed variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) by introducing stochastic lazy attributes. This approach converts the offline SDT check into on-the-fly generated guidance for constraining the decoder. Comparing to the state-of-the-art methods, our approach enforces constraints on the output space so that the output will be not only syntactically valid, but also semantically reasonable. We evaluate the proposed model with applications in programming language and molecules, including reconstruction and program/molecule optimization. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in incorporating syntactic and semantic constraints in discrete generative models, which is significantly better than current state-of-the-art approaches.
01	Neural text generation models are often autoregressive language models or seq2seq models. Neural autoregressive and seq2seq models that generate text by sampling words sequentially, with each word conditioned on the previous model, are state-of-the-art for several machine translation and summarization benchmarks. These benchmarks are often defined by validation perplexity even though this is not a direct measure of sample quality. Language models are typically trained via maximum likelihood and most often with teacher forcing. Teacher forcing is well-suited to optimizing perplexity but can result in poor sample quality because generating text requires conditioning on sequences of words that were never observed at training time. We propose to improve sample quality using Generative Adversarial Network (GANs), which explicitly train the generator to produce high quality samples and have shown a lot of success in image generation. GANs were originally to designed to output differentiable values, so discrete language generation is challenging for them. We introduce an actor-critic conditional GAN that fills in missing text conditioned on the surrounding context. We show qualitatively and quantitatively, evidence that this produces more realistic text samples compared to a maximum likelihood trained model.
01	While deep neural networks have proven to be a powerful tool for many recognition and classification tasks, their stability properties are still not well understood. In the past, image classifiers have been shown to be vulnerable to so-called adversarial attacks, which are created by additively perturbing the correctly classified image. In this paper, we propose the ADef algorithm to construct a different kind of adversarial attack created by iteratively applying small deformations to the image, found through a gradient descent step. We demonstrate our results on MNIST with convolutional neural networks and on ImageNet with Inception-v3 and ResNet-101.
10	We present an adversarial exploration strategy, a simple yet effective imitation learning scheme that incentivizes exploration of an environment without any extrinsic reward or human demonstration. Our framework consists of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent and an inverse dynamics model contesting with each other. The former collects training samples for the latter, and its objective is to maximize the error of the latter. The latter is trained with samples collected by the former, and generates rewards for the former when it fails to predict the actual action taken by the former. In such a competitive setting, the DRL agent learns to generate samples that the inverse dynamics model fails to predict correctly, and the inverse dynamics model learns to adapt to the challenging samples. We further propose a reward structure that ensures the DRL agent collects only moderately hard samples and not overly hard ones that prevent the inverse model from imitating effectively. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on several OpenAI gym robotic arm and hand manipulation tasks against a number of baseline models. Experimental results show that our method is comparable to that directly trained with expert demonstrations, and superior to the other baselines even without any human priors.
01	The desire to map neural networks to varying-capacity devices has led to the development of a wealth of compression techniques, many of which involve replacing standard convolutional blocks in a large network with cheap alternative blocks. However, not all blocks are created equally; for a required compute budget there may exist a potent combination of many different cheap blocks, though exhaustively searching for such a combination is prohibitively expensive. In this work, we develop BlockSwap: a fast algorithm for choosing networks with interleaved block types by passing a single minibatch of training data through randomly initialised networks and gauging their Fisher potential. These networks can then be used as students and distilled with the original large network as a teacher. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the chosen networks across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet for classification, and COCO for detection, and provide a comprehensive ablation study of our approach. BlockSwap quickly explores possible block configurations using a simple architecture ranking system, yielding highly competitive networks in orders of magnitude less time than most architecture search techniques (e.g. under 5 minutes on a single GPU for CIFAR-10).
10	Combining multiple function approximators in machine learning models typically leads to better performance and robustness compared with a single function. In reinforcement learning, ensemble algorithms such as an averaging method and a majority voting method are not always optimal, because each function can learn fundamentally different optimal trajectories from exploration. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Difference Weighted (TDW) algorithm, an ensemble method that adjusts weights of each contribution based on accumulated temporal difference errors. The advantage of this algorithm is that it improves ensemble performance by reducing weights of Q-functions unfamiliar with current trajectories. We provide experimental results for Gridworld tasks and Atari tasks that show significant performance improvements compared with baseline algorithms.
10	As machine learning becomes ubiquitous, deployed systems need to be as accu- rate as they can. As a result, machine learning service providers have a surging need for useful, additional training data that benefits training, without giving up all the details about the trained program. At the same time, data owners would like to trade their data for its value, without having to first give away the data itself be- fore receiving compensation. It is difficult for data providers and model providers to agree on a fair price without first revealing the data or the trained model to the other side. Escrow systems only complicate this further, adding an additional layer of trust required of both parties. Currently, data owners and model owners don‚Äôt have a fair pricing system that eliminates the need to trust a third party and training the model on the data, which 1) takes a long time to complete, 2) does not guarantee that useful data is paid valuably and that useless data isn‚Äôt, without trusting in the third party with both the model and the data. Existing improve- ments to secure the transaction focus heavily on encrypting or approximating the data, such as training on encrypted data, and variants of federated learning. As powerful as the methods appear to be, we show them to be impractical in our use case with real world assumptions for preserving privacy for the data owners when facing black-box models. Thus, a fair pricing scheme that does not rely on secure data encryption and obfuscation is needed before the exchange of data. This pa- per proposes a novel method for fair pricing using data-model efficacy techniques such as influence functions, model extraction, and model compression methods, thus enabling secure data transactions. We successfully show that without running the data through the model, one can approximate the value of the data; that is, if the data turns out redundant, the pricing is minimal, and if the data leads to proper improvement, its value is properly assessed, without placing strong assumptions on the nature of the model. Future work will be focused on establishing a system with stronger transactional security against adversarial attacks that will reveal details about the model or the data to the other party.
10	Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is time consuming. Prior work has explored how to reduce the computational demands of training by eliminating gradients with relatively small magnitude. We show that eliminating small magnitude components has limited impact on the direction of high-dimensional vectors. However, in the context of training a CNN, we find that eliminating small magnitude components of weight and activation vectors allows us to train deeper networks on more complex datasets versus eliminating small magnitude components of gradients. We propose Sparse Weight Activation Training (SWAT), an algorithm that embodies these observations. SWAT reduces computations by 50% to 80% with better accuracy at a given level of sparsity versus the Dynamic Sparse Graph algorithm. SWAT also reduces memory footprint by 23% to 37% for activations and 50% to 80% for weights.
01	Optimistic initialisation is an effective strategy for efficient exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). In the tabular case, all provably efficient model-free algorithms rely on it. However, model-free deep RL algorithms do not use optimistic initialisation despite taking inspiration from these provably efficient tabular algorithms. In particular, in scenarios with only positive rewards, Q-values are initialised at their lowest possible values due to commonly used network initialisation schemes, a pessimistic initialisation. Merely initialising the network to output optimistic Q-values is not enough, since we cannot ensure that they remain optimistic for novel state-action pairs, which is crucial for exploration. We propose a simple count-based augmentation to pessimistically initialised Q-values that separates the source of optimism from the neural network. We show that this scheme is provably efficient in the tabular setting and extend it to the deep RL setting. Our algorithm, Optimistic Pessimistically Initialised Q-Learning (OPIQ), augments the Q-value estimates of a DQN-based agent with count-derived bonuses to ensure optimism during both action selection and bootstrapping. We show that OPIQ outperforms non-optimistic DQN variants that utilise a pseudocount-based intrinsic motivation in hard exploration tasks, and that it predicts optimistic estimates for novel state-action pairs.
10	It has been noted in existing literature that over-parameterization in ReLU networks generally improves performance. While there could be several factors involved behind this, we prove some desirable theoretical properties at initialization which may be enjoyed by ReLU networks. Specifically, it is known that He initialization in deep ReLU networks asymptotically preserves variance of activations in the forward pass and variance of gradients in the backward pass for infinitely wide networks, thus preserving the flow of information in both directions. Our paper goes beyond these results and shows novel properties that hold under He initialization: i) the norm of hidden activation of each layer is equal to the norm of the input, and, ii) the norm of weight gradient of each layer is equal to the product of norm of the input vector and the error at output layer. These results are derived using the PAC analysis framework, and hold true for finitely sized datasets such that the width of the ReLU network only needs to be larger than a certain finite lower bound. As we show, this lower bound depends on the depth of the network and the number of samples, and by the virtue of being a lower bound, over-parameterized ReLU networks are endowed with these desirable properties. For the aforementioned hidden activation norm property under He initialization, we further extend our theory and show that this property holds for a finite width network even when the number of data samples is infinite. Thus we overcome several limitations of existing papers, and show new properties of deep ReLU networks at initialization.
10	Imitation learning relies on expert demonstrations. Existing approaches often re- quire that the complete demonstration data, including sequences of actions and states are available. In this paper, we consider a realistic and more difficult sce- nario where a reinforcement learning agent only has access to the state sequences of an expert, while the expert actions are not available. Inferring the unseen ex- pert actions in a stochastic environment is challenging and usually infeasible when combined with a large state space. We propose a novel policy learning method which only utilizes the expert state sequences without inferring the unseen ac- tions. Specifically, our agent first learns to extract useful sub-goal information from the state sequences of the expert and then utilizes the extracted sub-goal information to factorize the action value estimate over state-action pairs and sub- goals. The extracted sub-goals are also used to synthesize guidance rewards in the policy learning. We evaluate our agent on five Doom tasks. Our empirical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the conventional DQN method.
10	We improve previous end-to-end differentiable neural networks (NNs) with fastweight memories. A gate mechanism updates fast weights at every time step ofa sequence through two separate outer-product-based matrices generated by slowparts of the net. The system is trained on a complex sequence to sequence variationof the Associative Retrieval Problem with roughly 70 times more temporalmemory (i.e. time-varying variables) than similar-sized standard recurrent NNs(RNNs). In terms of accuracy and number of parameters, our architecture outperformsa variety of RNNs, including Long Short-Term Memory, Hypernetworks,and related fast weight architectures.
10	Continual learning is the problem of sequentially learning new tasks or knowledge while protecting previously acquired knowledge. However, catastrophic forgetting poses a grand challenge for neural networks performing such learning process. Thus, neural networks that are deployed in the real world often struggle in scenarios where the data distribution is non-stationary (concept drift), imbalanced, or not always fully available, i.e., rare edge cases. We propose a Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation model which is composed of a Differentiable Hebbian Plasticity (DHP) Softmax layer that adds a rapid learning plastic component (compressed episodic memory) to the fixed (slow changing) parameters of the softmax output layer; enabling learned representations to be retained for a longer timescale. We demonstrate the flexibility of our method by integrating well-known task-specific synaptic consolidation methods to penalize changes in the slow weights that are important for each target task. We evaluate our approach on the Permuted MNIST, Split MNIST and Vision Datasets Mixture benchmarks, and introduce an imbalanced variant of Permuted MNIST --- a dataset that combines the challenges of class imbalance and concept drift. Our proposed model requires no additional hyperparameters and outperforms comparable baselines by reducing forgetting.
01	 Conventional out-of-distribution (OOD) detection schemes based on variational autoencoder or Random Network Distillation (RND) are known to assign lower uncertainty to the OOD data than the target distribution. In this work, we discover that such conventional novelty detection schemes are also vulnerable to the blurred images. Based on the observation, we construct a novel RND-based OOD detector, SVD-RND, that utilizes blurred images during training. Our detector is simple, efficient in test time, and outperforms baseline OOD detectors in various domains. Further results show that SVD-RND learns a better target distribution representation than the baselines. Finally, SVD-RND combined with geometric transform achieves near-perfect detection accuracy in CelebA domain.
10	Most neural networks are trained using first-order optimization methods, which are sensitive to the parameterization of the model. Natural gradient descent is invariant to smooth reparameterizations because it is defined in a coordinate-free way, but tractable approximations are typically defined in terms of coordinate systems, and hence may lose the invariance properties. We analyze the invariance properties of the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) algorithm by constructing the algorithm in a coordinate-free way. We explicitly construct a Riemannian metric under which the natural gradient matches the K-FAC update; invariance to affine transformations of the activations follows immediately. We extend our framework to analyze the invariance properties of K-FAC appied to convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks, as well as metrics other than the usual Fisher metric.
10	withdrawn
10	We propose a simple approach for adversarial training. The proposed approach utilizes an adversarial interpolation scheme for generating adversarial images and accompanying adversarial labels, which are then used in place of the original data for model training. The proposed approach is intuitive to understand, simple to implement and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a number of datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN. Extensive empirical results compared with several state-of-the-art methods against different attacks verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 
10	Topic modeling of text documents is one of the most important tasks in representation learning. In this work, we propose iTM-VAE, which is a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) topic model with variational auto-encoders. On one hand, as a BNP topic model, iTM-VAE potentially has infinite topics and can adapt the topic number to data automatically. On the other hand, different with the other BNP topic models, the inference of iTM-VAE is modeled by neural networks, which has rich representation capacity and can be computed in a simple feed-forward manner. Two variants of iTM-VAE are also proposed in this paper, where iTM-VAE-Prod models the generative process in products-of-experts fashion for better performance and iTM-VAE-G places a prior over the concentration parameter such that the model can adapt a suitable concentration parameter to data automatically. Experimental results on 20News and Reuters RCV1-V2 datasets show that the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-arts in terms of perplexity, topic coherence and document retrieval tasks. Moreover, the ability of adjusting the concentration parameter to data is also confirmed by experiments.
10	Deep learning algorithms achieve high classification accuracy at the expense of significant computation cost. To address this cost, a number of quantization schemeshave been proposed - but most of these techniques focused on quantizing weights, which are relatively smaller in size compared to activations. This paper proposes a novel quantization scheme for activations during training - that enables neural networks to work well with ultra low precision weights and activations without any significant accuracy degradation.  This technique, PArameterized Clipping acTi-vation (PACT), uses an activation clipping parameter Œ± that is optimized duringtraining to find the right quantization scale. PACT allows quantizing activations toarbitrary bit precisions, while achieving much better accuracy relative to publishedstate-of-the-art quantization schemes. We show, for the first time, that both weights and activations can be quantized to 4-bits of precision while still achieving accuracy comparable to full precision networks across a range of popular models and datasets. We also show that exploiting these reduced-precision computational units in hardware can enable a super-linear improvement in inferencing performance dueto a significant reduction in the area of accelerator compute engines coupled with the ability to retain the quantized model and activation data in on-chip memories.
10	In this work, we focus on the problem of grounding language by training an agentto follow a set of natural language instructions and navigate to a target objectin a 2D grid environment. The agent receives visual information through rawpixels and a natural language instruction telling what task needs to be achieved.Other than these two sources of information, our model does not have any priorinformation of both the visual and textual modalities and is end-to-end trainable.We develop an attention mechanism for multi-modal fusion of visual and textualmodalities that allows the agent to learn to complete the navigation tasks and alsoachieve language grounding. Our experimental results show that our attentionmechanism outperforms the existing multi-modal fusion mechanisms proposed inorder to solve the above mentioned navigation task. We demonstrate through thevisualization of attention weights that our model learns to correlate attributes ofthe object referred in the instruction with visual representations and also showthat the learnt textual representations are semantically meaningful as they followvector arithmetic and are also consistent enough to induce translation between instructionsin different natural languages. We also show that our model generalizeseffectively to unseen scenarios and exhibit zero-shot generalization capabilities.In order to simulate the above described challenges, we introduce a new 2D environmentfor an agent to jointly learn visual and textual modalities
10	Recent findings indicate that over-parametrization, while crucial to the success of deep learning, also introduces large amounts of redundancy. Tensor methods have the potential to parametrize over-complete representations in a compact manner by leveraging this redundancy. In this paper, we propose fully parametrizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a single, low-rank tensor. Previous works on network tensorization haved focused on parametrizing individual layers (convolutional or fully connected) only, and perform the tensorization layer-by-layer disjointly. In contrast, we propose to jointly capture the full structure of a CNN by parametrizing it with a single, high-order tensor, the modes of which represent each of the architectural design parameters of the CNN (e.g. number of convolutional blocks, depth, number of stacks, input features, etc). This parametrization allows to regularize the whole network and drastically reduce the number of parameters by imposing a low-rank structure on that tensor. Further, our network is end-to-end trainable from scratch, which has been shown to be challenging in prior work. We study the case of networks with rich structure, namely Fully Convolutional CNNs, which we propose to parametrize them with a single 8-dimensional tensor. We show that our approach can achieve superior performance with small compression rates, and attain high compression rates with negligible drop in accuracy for the challenging task of human pose estimation.
10	Modularity is a key feature of deep learning libraries but has not been fully exploited for probabilistic programming. We propose to improve modularity of probabilistic programming language by offering not only plain probabilistic distributions but also sophisticated probabilistic model such as Bayesian non-parametric models as fundamental building blocks. We demonstrate this idea by presenting a modular probabilistic programming language MXFusion, which includes a new type of re-usable building blocks, called probabilistic modules. A probabilistic module consists of a set of random variables with associated probabilistic distributions and dedicated inference methods. Under the framework of variational inference, the pre-specified inference methods of individual probabilistic modules can be transparently used for inference of the whole probabilistic model. We demonstrate the power and convenience of probabilistic modules in MXFusion with various examples of Gaussian process models, which are evaluated with experiments on real data.
01	We present Value Propagation (VProp), a set of parameter-efficient differentiable planning modules built on Value Iteration which can successfully be trained using reinforcement learning to solve unseen tasks, has the capability to generalize to larger map sizes, and can learn to navigate in dynamic environments. We show that the modules enable learning to plan when the environment also includes stochastic elements, providing a cost-efficient learning system to build low-level size-invariant planners for a variety of interactive navigation problems. We evaluate on static and dynamic configurations of MazeBase grid-worlds, with randomly generated environments of several different sizes, and on a StarCraft navigation scenario, with more complex dynamics, and pixels as input.
01	Compression is a key step to deploy large neural networks on resource-constrained platforms. As a popular compression technique, quantization constrains the number of distinct weight values and thus reducing the number of bits required to represent and store each weight. In this paper, we study the representation power of quantized neural networks. First, we prove the universal approximability of quantized ReLU networks on a wide class of functions. Then we provide upper bounds on the number of weights and the memory size for a given approximation error bound and the bit-width of weights for function-independent and function-dependent structures. Our results reveal that, to attain an approximation error bound of $\epsilon$, the number of weights needed by a quantized network is no more than $\mathcal{O}\left(\log^5(1/\epsilon)\right)$ times that of an unquantized network. This overhead is of much lower order than the lower bound of the number of weights needed for the error bound, supporting the empirical success of various quantization techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on the complexity bounds of quantized neural networks.
10	We demonstrate how machine learning is able to model experiments in quantum physics. Quantum entanglement is a cornerstone for upcoming quantum technologies such as quantum computation and quantum cryptography. Of particular interest are complex quantum states with more than two particles and a large number of entangled quantum levels. Given such a multiparticle high-dimensional quantum state, it is usually impossible to reconstruct an experimental setup that produces it. To search for interesting experiments, one thus has to randomly create millions of setups on a computer and calculate the respective output states. In this work, we show that machine learning models can provide significant improvement over random search. We demonstrate that a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network can successfully learn to model quantum experiments by correctly predicting output state characteristics for given setups without the necessity of computing the states themselves. This approach not only allows for faster search but is also an essential step towards automated design of multiparticle high-dimensional quantum experiments using generative machine learning models.
10	We present an approach for anytime predictions in deep neural networks (DNNs). For each test sample, an anytime predictor produces a coarse result quickly, and then continues to refine it until the test-time computational budget is depleted. Such predictors can address the growing computational problem of DNNs by automatically adjusting to varying test-time budgets. In this work, we study a \emph{general} augmentation to feed-forward networks to form anytime neural networks (ANNs) via auxiliary predictions and losses. Specifically, we point out a blind-spot in recent studies in such ANNs: the importance of high final accuracy. In fact, we show on multiple recognition data-sets and architectures that by having near-optimal final predictions in small anytime models, we can effectively double the speed of large ones to reach corresponding accuracy level. We achieve such speed-up with simple weighting of anytime losses that oscillate during training. We also assemble a sequence of exponentially deepening ANNs, to achieve both theoretically and practically near-optimal anytime results at any budget, at the cost of a constant fraction of additional consumed budget.
10	Few shot image classification aims at learning a classifier from limited labeled data. Generating the classification weights has been applied in many meta-learning approaches for few shot image classification due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, we argue that it is difficult to generate the exact and universal classification weights for all the diverse query samples from very few training samples. In this work, we introduce Attentive Weights Generation for few shot learning via Information Maximization (AWGIM), which addresses current issues by two novel contributions. i) AWGIM generates different classification weights for different query samples by letting each of query samples attends to the whole support set. ii) To guarantee the generated weights adaptive to different query sample, we re-formulate the problem to maximize the lower bound of mutual information between generated weights and query as well as support data. As far as we can see, this is the first attempt to unify information maximization into few shot learning. Both two contributions are proved to be effective in the extensive experiments and we show that AWGIM is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.
10	We show that finite-width deep ReLU neural networks yield rate-distortion optimal approximation (B√∂lcskei et al., 2018) of a wide class of functions, including polynomials, windowed sinusoidal functions, one-dimensional oscillatory textures, and the Weierstrass function, a fractal function which is continuous but nowhere differentiable. Together with the recently established universal approximation result for affine function systems (B√∂lcskei et al., 2018), this demonstrates that deep neural networks approximate vastly different signal structures generated by the affine group, the Weyl-Heisenberg group, or through warping, and even certain fractals, all with approximation error decaying exponentially in the number of neurons. We also prove that in the approximation of sufficiently smooth functions finite-width deep networks require strictly fewer neurons than finite-depth wide networks.
10	Learning neural networks with gradient descent over a long sequence of tasks is problematic as their fine-tuning to new tasks overwrites the network weights that are important for previous tasks. This leads to a poor performance on old tasks ‚Äì a phenomenon framed as catastrophic forgetting.  While early approaches use task rehearsal and growing networks that both limit the scalability of the task sequence orthogonal approaches build on regularization.  Based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) changes to parameters that are relevant to old tasks are penalized, which forces the task to be mapped into the available remaining capacity of the network. This requires to calculate the Hessian around a mode, which makes learning tractable. In this paper, we introduce Hessian-free curvature estimates as an alternative method to actually calculating the Hessian.  In contrast to previous work, we exploit the fact that most regions in the loss surface are flat and hence only calculate a Hessian-vector-product around the surface that is relevant for the current task. Our experiments show that on a variety of well-known task sequences we either significantly outperform or are en par with previous work.
10	Learning deep networks which can resist large variations between training andtesting data is essential to build accurate and robust image classifiers.  Towardsthis end, a typical strategy is to apply data augmentation to enlarge the trainingset.   However,  standard  data  augmentation  is  essentially  a  brute-force  strategywhich is inefficient,  as it performs all the pre-defined transformations  to everytraining sample. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to train networkswith  significantly  improved  resistance  to  large  variations  between  training  andtesting data.  This is achieved by embedding a learnable transformation moduleinto the introspective networks (Jin et al., 2017; Lazarow et al., 2017; Lee et al.,2018), which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier empowered withgenerative capabilities.  Our approach alternatively synthesizes pseudo-negativesamples with learned transformations and enhances the classifier by retraining itwith synthesized samples.  Experimental results verify that our approach signif-icantly improves the ability of deep networks to resist large variations betweentraining and testing data and achieves classification accuracy improvements onseveral benchmark datasets, including MNIST, affNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10.
10	Recent advances have made it possible to create deep complex-valued neural networks. Despite this progress, the potential power of fully complex intermediate computations and representations has not yet been explored for many challenging learning problems. Building on recent advances, we propose a novel mechanism for extracting signals in the frequency domain. As a case study, we perform audio source separation in the Fourier domain. Our extraction mechanism could be regarded as a local ensembling method that combines a complex-valued convolutional version of Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) and a signal averaging operation. We also introduce a new explicit amplitude and phase-aware loss, which is scale and time invariant, taking into account the complex-valued components of the spectrogram. Using the Wall Street Journal Dataset, we compare our phase-aware loss to several others that operate both in the time and frequency domains and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed signal extraction method and proposed loss. When operating in the complex-valued frequency domain, our deep complex-valued network substantially outperforms its real-valued counterparts even with half the depth and a third of the parameters. Our proposed mechanism improves significantly deep complex-valued networks' performance and we demonstrate the usefulness of its regularizing effect.
01	We present sketch-rnn, a recurrent neural network able to construct stroke-based drawings of common objects. The model is trained on a dataset of human-drawn images representing many different classes. We outline a framework for conditional and unconditional sketch generation, and describe new robust training methods for generating coherent sketch drawings in a vector format.
01	Graphs are a prevalent tool in data science, as they model the inherent structure of the data. Typically they are constructed either by connecting nearest samples, or by learning them from data, solving an optimization problem. While graph learning does achieve a better quality, it also comes with a higher computational cost. In particular, the current state-of-the-art model cost is O(n^2) for n samples.In this paper, we show how to scale it, obtaining an approximation with leading cost of O(n log(n)), with quality that approaches the exact graph learning model. Our algorithm uses known approximate nearest neighbor techniques to reduce the number of variables, and automatically selects the correct parameters of the model, requiring a single intuitive input: the desired edge density.
10	Deep learning yields great results across many fields,from speech recognition, image classification, to translation.But for each problem, getting a deep model to work well involvesresearch into the architecture and a long period of tuning.We present a single model that yields good results on a numberof problems spanning multiple domains. In particular, this single modelis trained concurrently on ImageNet, multiple translation tasks,image captioning (COCO dataset), a speech recognition corpus,and an English parsing task. Our model architecture incorporates building blocks from multipledomains. It contains convolutional layers, an attention mechanism,and sparsely-gated layers.Each of these computational blocks is crucial for a subset ofthe tasks we train on. Interestingly, even if a block is notcrucial for a task, we observe that adding it never hurts performanceand in most cases improves it on all tasks.We also show that tasks with less data benefit largely from jointtraining with other tasks, while performance on large tasks degradesonly slightly if at all.
10	We show that by comparing the individual complexities of univariante cause and effect in the Structural Causal Model, one can identify the cause and the effect, without considering their interaction at all. The entropy of each variable is ineffective in measuring the complexity, and we propose to capture it by an autoencoder that operates on the list of sorted samples. Comparing the reconstruction errors of the two autoencoders, one for each variable, is shown to perform well on the accepted benchmarks of the field.In the multivariate case, where one can ensure that the complexities of the cause and effect are balanced, we propose a new method that mimics the disentangled structure of the causal model. We extend the results of~\cite{Zhang:2009:IPC:1795114.1795190} to the multidimensional case, showing that such modeling is only likely in the direction of causality. Furthermore, the learned model is shown theoretically to perform the separation to the causal component and to the residual  (noise) component. Our multidimensional method obtains a significantly higher accuracy than the literature methods.
01	We study the problem of generating adversarial examples in a black-box setting in which only loss-oracle access to a model is available. We introduce a framework that conceptually unifies much of the existing work on black-box attacks, and demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art methods are optimal in a natural sense. Despite this optimality, we show how to improve black-box attacks by bringing a new element into the problem: gradient priors. We give a bandit optimization-based algorithm that allows us to seamlessly integrate any such priors, and we explicitly identify and incorporate two examples. The resulting methods use two to four times fewer queries and fail two to five times less than the current state-of-the-art. The code for reproducing our work is available at https://git.io/fAjOJ.
10	With the rise in employment of deep learning methods in safety-critical scenarios, interpretability is more essential than ever before. Although many different directions regarding interpretability have been explored for visual modalities, time-series data has been neglected with only a handful of methods tested due to their poor intelligibility. We approach the problem of interpretability in a novel way by proposing TSInsight where we attach an auto-encoder with a sparsity-inducing norm on its output to the classifier and fine-tune it based on the gradients from the classifier and a reconstruction penalty. The auto-encoder learns to preserve features that are important for the prediction by the classifier and suppresses the ones that are irrelevant i.e. serves as a feature attribution method to boost interpretability. In other words, we ask the network to only reconstruct parts which are useful for the classifier i.e. are correlated or causal for the prediction. In contrast to most other attribution frameworks, TSInsight is capable of generating both instance-based and model-based explanations. We evaluated TSInsight along with other commonly used attribution methods on a range of different time-series datasets to validate its efficacy. Furthermore, we analyzed the set of properties that TSInsight achieves out of the box including adversarial robustness and output space contraction. The obtained results advocate that TSInsight can be an effective tool for the interpretability of deep time-series models.
10	Training certifiable neural networks enables one to obtain models with robustness guarantees against adversarial attacks. In this work, we use a linear approximation to bound model‚Äôs output given an input adversarial budget. This allows us to bound the adversary-free region in the data neighborhood by a polyhedral envelope and yields finer-grained certified robustness than existing methods. We further exploit this certifier to introduce a framework called polyhedral envelope regular- ization (PER), which encourages larger polyhedral envelopes and thus improves the provable robustness of the models. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework on standard benchmarks; it applies to networks with general activation functions and obtains comparable or better robustness guarantees than state-of-the-art methods, with very little cost in clean accuracy, i.e., without over-regularizing the model.
01	(Frankle & Carbin, 2019) shows that there exist winning tickets (small but critical subnetworks) for dense, randomly initialized networks, that can be trained alone to achieve comparable accuracies to the latter in a similar number of iterations. However, the identification of these winning tickets still requires the costly train-prune-retrain process, limiting their practical benefits. In this paper, we discover for the first time that the winning tickets can be identified at the very early training stage, which we term as Early-Bird (EB) tickets, via low-cost training schemes (e.g., early stopping and low-precision training) at large learning rates. Our finding of EB tickets is consistent with recently reported observations that the key connectivity patterns of neural networks emerge early. Furthermore, we propose a mask distance metric that can be used to identify EB tickets with low computational overhead, without needing to know the true winning tickets that emerge after the full training. Finally, we leverage the existence of EB tickets and the proposed mask distance to develop efficient training methods, which are achieved by first identifying EB tickets via low-cost schemes, and then continuing to train merely the EB tickets towards the target accuracy. Experiments based on various deep networks and datasets validate: 1) the existence of EB tickets and the effectiveness of mask distance in efficiently identifying them; and 2) that the proposed efficient training via EB tickets can achieve up to 5.8x ~ 10.7x energy savings while maintaining comparable or even better accuracy as compared to the most competitive state-of-the-art training methods, demonstrating a promising and easily adopted method for tackling cost-prohibitive deep network training.
10	This paper presents a method to solve the city metro network expansion problem using reinforcement learning (RL). In this method, we formulate the metro expansion as a process of sequential station selection, and design feasibility rules based on the selected station sequence to ensure the reasonable connection patterns of metro line. Following this formulation, we train an actor critic model to design the next metro line. The actor is a seq2seq network with attention mechanism to generate the parameterized policy which is the probability distribution over feasible stations. The critic is used to estimate the expected reward, which is determined by the output station sequences generated by the actor during training, in order to reduce the training variance. The learning procedure only requires the reward calculation, thus our general method can be extended to multi-factor cases easily. Considering origin-destination (OD) trips and social equity, we expand the current metro network in Xi'an, China, based on the real mobility information of 24,770,715 mobile phone users in the whole city. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 
10	Word-embeddings are a vital component of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and have been extensively researched. Better representations of words have come at the cost of huge memory footprints, which has made deploying NLP models on edge-devices challenging due to memory limitations. Compressing embedding matrices without sacrificing model performance is essential for successful commercial edge deployment. In this paper, we propose Distilled Embedding, an (input/output) embedding compression method based on low-rank matrix decomposition with an added non-linearity. First, we initialize the weights of our decomposition by learning to reconstruct the full word-embedding and then fine-tune on the downstream task employing knowledge distillation on the factorized embedding. We conduct extensive experimentation with various compression rates on machine translation, using different data-sets with a shared word-embedding matrix for both embedding and vocabulary projection matrices. We show that the proposed technique outperforms conventional low-rank matrix factorization, and other recently proposed word-embedding matrix compression methods. 
10	Human and animals continuously acquire, adapt as well as transfer knowledge throughout their lifespan. The ability to learn continuously is crucial for the effective functioning of agents interacting with the real world and processing continuous streams of information. Continuous learning has been a long-standing challenge for neural networks as the repeated acquisition of information from non-uniform data distributions generally lead to catastrophic forgetting or interference.  This work proposes a modular architecture capable of continuous acquisition of tasks while averting catastrophic forgetting.  Specifically, our contributions are: (i) Efficient Architecture: a modular architecture emulating the visual cortex that can learn meaningful representations with limited labelled examples, (ii) Knowledge Retention: retention of learned knowledge via limited replay of past experiences, (iii) Forward Transfer: efficient and relatively faster learning on new tasks, and (iv) Naturally Skewed Distributions: The learning  in the above-mentioned claims is performed on non-uniform data distributions which better represent the natural statistics of our ongoing experience. Several experiments that substantiate the above-mentioned claims are demonstrated on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
10	This paper addresses the problem of representing a system's belief using multi-variate normal distributions (MND) where the underlying model is based on a deep neural network (DNN). The major challenge with DNNs is the computational complexity that is needed to obtain model uncertainty using MNDs. To achieve a scalable method, we propose a novel approach that expresses the parameter posterior in sparse information form. Our inference algorithm is based on a novel Laplace Approximation scheme, which involves a diagonal correction of the Kronecker-factored eigenbasis. As this makes the inversion of the information matrix intractable - an operation that is required for full Bayesian analysis, we devise a low-rank   approximation of this eigenbasis and a memory-efficient sampling scheme. We provide both a theoretical analysis and an empirical evaluation on various benchmark data sets, showing the superiority of our approach over existing methods.
10	Two important topics in deep learning both involve incorporating humans into the modeling process: Model priors transfer information from humans to a model by regularizing the model's parameters; Model attributions transfer information from a model to humans by explaining the model's behavior. Previous work has taken important steps to connect these topics through various forms of gradient regularization. We find, however, that existing methods that use attributions to align a model's behavior with human intuition are ineffective. We develop an efficient and theoretically grounded feature attribution method, expected gradients, and a novel framework, attribution priors, to enforce prior expectations about a model's behavior during training. We demonstrate that attribution priors are broadly applicable by instantiating them on three different types of data: image data, gene expression data, and health care data. Our experiments show that models trained with attribution priors are more intuitive and achieve better generalization performance than both equivalent baselines and existing methods to regularize model behavior.
01	A dynamical neural network consists of a set of interconnected neurons that interact over time continuously. It can exhibit computational properties in the sense that the dynamical system‚Äôs evolution and/or limit points in the associated state space can correspond to numerical solutions to certain mathematical optimization or learning problems. Such a computational system is particularly attractive in that it can be mapped to a massively parallel computer architecture for power and throughput efficiency, especially if each neuron can rely solely on local information (i.e., local memory). Deriving gradients from the dynamical network‚Äôs various states while conforming to this last constraint, however, is challenging. We show that by combining ideas of top-down feedback and contrastive learning, a dynamical network for solving the l1-minimizing dictionary learning problem can be constructed, and the true gradients for learning are provably computable by individual neurons. Using spiking neurons to construct our dynamical network, we present a learning process, its rigorous mathematical analysis, and numerical results on several dictionary learning problems.
10	This work provides an additional step in the theoretical understanding of neural networks. We consider neural networks with one hidden layer and show that when learning symmetric functions, one can choose initial conditions so that standard SGD training efficiently produces generalization guarantees. We empirically verify this and show that this does not hold when the initial conditions are chosen at random. The proof of convergence investigates the interaction between the two layers of the network. Our results highlight the importance of using symmetry in the design of neural networks.
01	We propose a novel score-based approach to learning a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observational data. We adapt a recently proposed continuous constrained optimization formulation to allow for nonlinear relationships between variables using neural networks. This extension allows to model complex interactions while avoiding the combinatorial nature of the problem. In addition to comparing our method to existing continuous optimization methods, we provide missing empirical comparisons to nonlinear greedy search methods. On both synthetic and real-world data sets, this new method outperforms current continuous methods on most tasks while being competitive with existing greedy search methods on important metrics for causal inference.
10	We examine how learning from unaligned data can improve both the data efficiency of supervised tasks as well as enable alignments without any supervision. For example, consider unsupervised machine translation: the input is two corpora of English and French, and the task is to translate from one language to the other but without any pairs of English and French sentences. To address this, we develop feature-matching autoencoders (FMAEs). FMAEs ensure that the marginal distribution of feature layers are preserved across forward and inverse mappings between domains. We show that FMAEs achieve state of the art for data efficiency and alignment across three tasks: text decipherment, sentiment transfer, and neural machine translation for English-to-German and English-to-French. Most compellingly, FMAEs achieve state of the art for neural translation with limited supervision, with significant BLEU score differences of up to 5.7 and 6.3 over traditional supervised models. Furthermore, on English-to-German, they outperform last year's best fully supervised models such as ByteNet (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016) while using only half as many supervised examples.
01	Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive predictive performance due to their ability to learn complex, non-linear relationships between variables. However, the inability to effectively visualize these relationships has led to DNNs being characterized as black boxes and consequently limited their applications. To ameliorate this problem, we introduce the use of hierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions through our proposed method: agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD). Given a prediction from a trained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features, along with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This hierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned are predictive. We introduce ACD using examples from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet, in order to diagnose incorrect predictions, identify dataset bias, and extract polarizing phrases of varying lengths. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD enables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better trust a DNN's outputs. We also find that ACD's hierarchy is largely robust to adversarial perturbations, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the input and ignores spurious noise.
10	The generalization ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is intertwined with model complexity, robustness, and capacity. Through establishing an equivalence between a DNN and a noisy communication channel, we characterize generalization and fault tolerance for unbounded adversarial attacks in terms of information-theoretic quantities. Invoking rate-distortion theory, we suggest that excess capacity is a significant cause of vulnerability to adversarial examples.
01	This paper introduces a new framework for open-domain question answering in which the retriever and the reader \emph{iteratively interact} with each other. The framework is agnostic to the architecture of the machine reading model provided it has \emph{access} to the token-level hidden representations of the reader. The retriever uses fast nearest neighbor search that allows it to scale to corpora containing millions of paragraphs. A gated recurrent unit updates the query at each step conditioned on the \emph{state} of the reader and the \emph{reformulated} query is used to re-rank the paragraphs by the retriever. We conduct analysis and show that iterative interaction helps in retrieving informative paragraphs from the corpus. Finally, we show that our multi-step-reasoning framework brings consistent improvement when applied to two widely used reader architectures (\drqa and \bidaf) on various large open-domain datasets ---\tqau, \quasart, \searchqa, and \squado\footnote{Code and pretrained models are available at \url{https://github.com/rajarshd/Multi-Step-Reasoning}}.
01	This paper proposes a neural end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) model which can control latent attributes in the generated speech that are rarely annotated in the training data, such as speaking style, accent, background noise, and recording conditions. The model is formulated as a conditional generative model with two levels of hierarchical latent variables. The first level is a categorical variable, which represents attribute groups (e.g. clean/noisy) and provides interpretability. The second level, conditioned on the first, is a multivariate Gaussian variable, which characterizes specific attribute configurations (e.g. noise level, speaking rate) and enables disentangled fine-grained control over these attributes. This amounts to using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for the latent distribution. Extensive evaluation demonstrates its ability to control the aforementioned attributes. In particular, it is capable of consistently synthesizing high-quality clean speech regardless of the quality of the training data for the target speaker.
10	Neural network out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify when a model is unable to generalize to new inputs, either due to covariate shift or anomalous data. Most existing OOD methods only apply to classification tasks, as they assume a discrete set of possible predictions. In this paper, we propose a method for neural network OOD detection that can be applied to regression problems. We demonstrate that the hidden features for in-distribution data can be described by a highly concentrated, low dimensional distribution. Therefore, we can model these in-distribution features with an extremely simple generative model, such as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with 4 or fewer components. We demonstrate on several real-world benchmark data sets that GMM-based feature detection achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection results on several regression tasks. Moreover, this approach is simple to implement and computationally efficient.
10	In this paper we present a deep Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) method that can be trained end-to-end to perform classification from weak supervision. Our MIL method is implemented as a two stream neural network, specialized in tasks of instance classification and weighting. Our instance weighting stream makes use of Gaussian radial basis function to normalize the instance weights by comparing instances locally within the bag and globally across bags. The final classification score of the bag is an aggregate of all instance classification scores. The instance representation is shared by both instance classification and weighting streams. The Gaussian instance weighting allows us to regularize the representation learning of instances such that all positive instances to be closer to each other w.r.t. the instance weighting function. We evaluate our method on five standard MIL datasets and show that our method outperforms other MIL methods. We also evaluate our model on two datasets where all models are trained end-to-end. Our method obtain better bag-classification and instance classification results on these datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to investigate the robustness of the proposed model and obtain interesting insights.
10	Recently, researchers have discovered that the state-of-the-art object classifiers can be fooled easily by small perturbations in the input unnoticeable to human eyes.  It is known that an attacker can generate strong adversarial examples if she knows the classifier parameters. Conversely, a defender can robustify the classifier by retraining if she has the adversarial examples. The cat-and-mouse game nature of attacks and defenses raises the question of the presence of equilibria in the dynamics.In this paper, we present a neural-network based attack class to approximate a larger but intractable class of attacks, and formulate the attacker-defender interaction as a zero-sum leader-follower game. We present sensitivity-penalized optimization algorithms to find minimax solutions, which are the best worst-case defenses against whitebox attacks. Advantages of the learning-based attacks and defenses compared to gradient-based attacks and defenses are demonstrated with MNIST and CIFAR-10.
01	Mode connectivity provides novel geometric insights on analyzing loss landscapes and enables building high-accuracy pathways between well-trained neural networks. In this work, we propose to employ mode connectivity in loss landscapes to study the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks, and provide novel methods for improving this robustness.  Our experiments cover various types of adversarial attacks applied to different network architectures and datasets. When network models are tampered with backdoor or error-injection attacks, our results demonstrate that the path connection learned using limited amount of bonafide data can effectively mitigate adversarial effects while maintaining the original accuracy on clean data. Therefore, mode connectivity provides users with the power to repair backdoored or error-injected models.  We also use mode connectivity to investigate the loss landscapes of regular and robust models against evasion attacks. Experiments show that there exists a barrier in adversarial robustness loss on the path connecting regular and adversarially-trained models.  A high correlation is observed between the adversarial robustness loss and the largest eigenvalue of the input Hessian matrix, for which theoretical justifications are provided.  Our results suggest that mode connectivity offers a holistic tool and practical means for evaluating and improving adversarial robustness.
10	Given a large database of concepts but only one or a few examples of each, can we learn models for each concept that are not only generalisable, but interpretable? In this work, we aim to tackle this problem through hierarchical Bayesian program induction. We present a novel learning algorithm which can infer concepts as short, generative, stochastic programs, while learning a global prior over programs to improve generalisation and a recognition network for efficient inference. Our algorithm, Wake-Sleep-Remember (WSR), combines gradient learning for continuous parameters with neurally-guided search over programs. We show that WSR learns compelling latent programs in two tough symbolic domains: cellular automata and Gaussian process kernels. We also collect and evaluate on a new dataset, Text-Concepts, for discovering structured patterns in natural text data.
10	Miscalibration -- a mismatch between a model's confidence and its correctness -- of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) makes their predictions hard for downstream components to trust. Ideally, we want networks to be accurate, calibrated and confident. Temperature scaling, the most popular calibration approach, will calibrate a DNN without affecting its accuracy, but it will also make its correct predictions under-confident. In this paper, we show that replacing the widely used cross-entropy loss with focal loss allows us to learn models that are already very well calibrated. When combined with temperature scaling, focal loss, whilst preserving accuracy and yielding state-of-the-art calibrated models, also preserves the confidence of the model's correct predictions, which is extremely desirable for downstream tasks. We provide a thorough analysis of the factors causing miscalibration, and use the insights we glean from this to theoretically justify the empirically excellent performance of focal loss. We perform extensive experiments on a variety of computer vision (CIFAR-10/100) and NLP (SST, 20 Newsgroup) datasets, and with a wide variety of different network architectures, and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and calibration in almost all cases.
10	Generating formal-language represented by relational tuples, such as Lisp programs or mathematical expressions, from a natural-language input is an extremely challenging task because it requires to explicitly capture discrete symbolic structural information from the input to generate the output. Most state-of-the-art neural sequence models do not explicitly capture such structure information, and thus do not perform well on these tasks. In this paper, we propose a new encoder-decoder model based on Tensor Product Representations (TPRs) for Natural- to Formal-language generation, called TP-N2F. The encoder of TP-N2F employs TPR 'binding' to encode natural-language symbolic structure in vector space and the decoder uses TPR 'unbinding' to generate a sequence of relational tuples, each consisting of a relation (or operation) and a number of arguments, in symbolic space. TP-N2F considerably outperforms LSTM-based Seq2Seq models, creating a new state of the art results on two benchmarks: the MathQA dataset for math problem solving, and the AlgoList dataset for program synthesis. Ablation studies show that improvements are mainly attributed to the use of TPRs in both the encoder and decoder to explicitly capture relational structure information for symbolic reasoning. 
10	We introduce a new method for training GANs by applying the Wasserstein-2 metric proximal on the generators. The approach is based on the gradient operator induced by optimal transport, which connects the geometry of sample space and parameter space in implicit deep generative models. From this theory, we obtain an easy-to-implement regularizer for the parameter updates. Our experiments demonstrate that this method improves the speed and stability in training GANs in terms of wall-clock time and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) learning curves. 
10	Generating point clouds, e.g., molecular structures, in arbitrary rotations, translations, and enumerations remains a challenging task. Meanwhile, neural networksutilizing symmetry invariant layers have been shown to be able to optimize theirtraining objective in a data-efficient way. In this spirit, we present an architecturewhich allows to produce valid Euclidean distance matrices, which by construction are already invariant under rotation and translation of the described object.Motivated by the goal to generate molecular structures in Cartesian space, we usethis architecture to construct a Wasserstein GAN utilizing a permutation invariant critic network. This makes it possible to generate molecular structures in aone-shot fashion by producing Euclidean distance matrices which have a three-dimensional embedding.
01	Answering compositional questions that require multiple steps of reasoning against text is challenging, especially when they involve discrete, symbolic operations. Neural module networks (NMNs) learn to parse such questions as executable programs composed of learnable modules, performing well on synthetic visual QA domains. However, we find that it is challenging to learn these models for non-synthetic questions on open-domain text, where a model needs to deal with the diversity of natural language and perform a broader range of reasoning. We extend NMNs by: (a) introducing modules that reason over a paragraph of text, performing symbolic reasoning (such as arithmetic, sorting, counting) over numbers and dates in a probabilistic and differentiable manner; and (b) proposing an unsupervised auxiliary loss to help extract arguments associated with the events in text. Additionally, we show that a limited amount of heuristically-obtained question program and intermediate module output supervision provides sufficient inductive bias for accurate learning. Our proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on a subset of the DROP dataset that poses a variety of reasoning challenges that are covered by our modules.
10	In probabilistic classification, a discriminative model based on Gaussian mixture exhibits flexible fitting capability. Nevertheless, it is difficult to determine the number of components. We propose a sparse classifier based on a discriminative Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which is named sparse discriminative Gaussian mixture (SDGM). In the SDGM, a GMM-based discriminative model is trained by sparse Bayesian learning. This learning algorithm improves the generalization capability by obtaining a sparse solution and automatically determines the number of components by removing redundant components. The SDGM can be embedded into neural networks (NNs) such as convolutional NNs and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method prevented overfitting by obtaining sparsity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed a fully connected layer with the softmax function in certain cases when it was used as the last layer of a deep NN.
10	Training generative adversarial networks is unstable in high-dimensions as the true data distribution tends to be concentrated in a small fraction of the ambient space. The discriminator is then quickly able to classify nearly all generated samples as fake, leaving the generator without meaningful gradients and causing it to deteriorate after a point in training. In this work, we propose training a single generator simultaneously against an array of discriminators, each of which looks at a different random low-dimensional projection of the data. Individual discriminators, now provided with restricted views of the input, are unable to reject generated samples perfectly and continue to provide meaningful gradients to the generator throughout training.  Meanwhile, the generator learns to produce samples consistent with the full data distribution to satisfy all discriminators simultaneously. We  demonstrate the practical utility of this approach experimentally, and show that it is able to produce image samples with higher quality than traditional training with a single discriminator.
10	CapsNet (Capsule Network) was first proposed by Sabour et al. (2017) and lateranother version of CapsNet was proposed by Hinton et al. (2018).  CapsNet hasbeen proved effective in modeling spatial features with much fewer parameters.However, the routing procedures (dynamic routing and EM routing) in both pa-pers are not well incorporated into the whole training process,  and the optimalnumber for the routing procedure has to be found manually.  We propose Gen-eralized GapsNet (G-CapsNet) to overcome this disadvantages by incorporatingthe routing procedure into the optimization.  We implement two versions of G-CapsNet (fully-connected and convolutional) on CAFFE (Jia et al. (2014)) andevaluate them by testing the accuracy on MNIST & CIFAR10, the robustness towhite-box & black-box attack, and the generalization ability on GAN-generatedsynthetic images.  We also explore the scalability of G-CapsNet by constructinga relatively deep G-CapsNet.   The experiment shows that G-CapsNet has goodgeneralization ability and scalability. 
10	Automatic question generation from paragraphs is an important and challenging problem, particularly due to the long context from paragraphs. In this paper, we propose and study two hierarchical models for the task of question generation from paragraphs. Specifically, we propose (a) a novel hierarchical BiLSTM model with selective attention and (b) a novel hierarchical Transformer architecture, both of which learn hierarchical representations of paragraphs. We model a paragraph in terms of its constituent sentences, and a sentence in terms of its constituent words. While the introduction of the attention mechanism benefits the hierarchical BiLSTM model, the hierarchical Transformer, with its inherent attention and positional encoding mechanisms also performs better than flat transformer model.We conducted empirical evaluation on the widely used SQuAD and MS MARCO datasets using standard metrics. The results demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the hierarchical models over their flat counterparts. Qualitatively, our hierarchical models are able to generate fluent and relevant questions.
10	For distributions $p$ and $q$ with different supports, the divergence $\div{p}{q}$ may not exist. We define a spread divergence $\sdiv{p}{q}$ on modified $p$ and $q$ and describe sufficient conditions for the existence of such a divergence. We demonstrate how to maximize the discriminatory power of a given divergence by parameterizing and learning the spread. We also give examples of using a spread divergence to train and improve implicit generative models, including linear models (Independent Components Analysis) and non-linear models (Deep Generative Networks).
01	We develop a mean field theory for batch normalization in fully-connected feedforward neural networks. In so doing, we provide a precise characterization of signal propagation and gradient backpropagation in wide batch-normalized networks at initialization. Our theory shows that gradient signals grow exponentially in depth and that these exploding gradients cannot be eliminated by tuning the initial weight variances or by adjusting the nonlinear activation function. Indeed, batch normalization itself is the cause of gradient explosion. As a result, vanilla batch-normalized networks without skip connections are not trainable at large depths for common initialization schemes, a prediction that we verify with a variety of empirical simulations. While gradient explosion cannot be eliminated, it can be reduced by tuning the network close to the linear regime, which improves the trainability of deep batch-normalized networks without residual connections. Finally, we investigate the learning dynamics of batch-normalized networks and observe that after a single step of optimization the networks achieve a relatively stable equilibrium in which gradients have dramatically smaller dynamic range. Our theory leverages Laplace, Fourier, and Gegenbauer transforms and we derive new identities that may be of independent interest.
10	"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved unprecedented practical success in many applications.However, how to interpret DNNs is still an open problem.In particular, what do hidden layers behave is not clearly understood. In this paper, relying on a teacher-student paradigm, we seek to understand the layer behaviors of DNNs by ``monitoring"" both across-layer and single-layer distribution evolution to some target distribution in the training. Here, the ``across-layer"" and ``single-layer"" considers the layer behavior \emph{along the depth} and  a specific layer \emph{along training epochs}, respectively. Relying on optimal transport theory, we employ the Wasserstein distance ($W$-distance)  to measure the divergence between the layer distribution and the target distribution. Theoretically, we prove that i) the $W$-distance of across layers to the target distribution tends to decrease along the depth. ii) the $W$-distance of a specific layer to the target distribution tends to decrease along training iterations. iii) However, a deep layer is not always better than a shallow layer for some samples. Moreover, our results helps to analyze the stability of layer distributions and explains why auxiliary losses helps the training of DNNs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets justify our theoretical findings."
10	Spiking neural networks are being investigated both as biologically plausible models of neural computation and also as a potentially more efficient type of neural network. While convolutional spiking neural networks have been demonstrated to achieve near state-of-the-art performance, only one solution has been proposed to convert gated recurrent neural networks, so far.Recurrent neural networks in the form of networks of gating memory cells have been central in state-of-the-art solutions in problem domains that involve sequence recognition or generation. Here, we design an analog gated LSTM cell where its neurons can be substituted for efficient stochastic spiking neurons. These adaptive spiking neurons implement an adaptive form of sigma-delta coding to convert internally computed analog activation values to spike-trains. For such neurons, we approximate the effective activation function, which resembles a sigmoid. We show how analog neurons with such activation functions can be used to create an analog LSTM cell; networks of these cells can then be trained with standard backpropagation. We train these LSTM networks on a noisy and noiseless version of the original sequence prediction task from Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), and also on a noisy and noiseless version of a classical working memory reinforcement learning task, the T-Maze. Substituting the analog neurons for corresponding adaptive spiking neurons, we then show that almost all resulting spiking neural network equivalents correctly compute the original tasks.
10	We study the statistical properties of the endpoint of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We approximate SGD as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and consider its Boltzmann Gibbs equilibrium distribution under the assumption of isotropic variance in loss gradients.. Through this analysis, we find that three factors ‚Äì learning rate, batch size and the variance of the loss gradients ‚Äì control the trade-off between the depth and width of the minima found by SGD, with wider minima favoured by a higher ratio of learning rate to batch size. In the equilibrium distribution only the ratio of learning rate to batch size appears, implying that it‚Äôs invariant under a simultaneous rescaling of each by the same amount. We experimentally show how learning rate and batch size affect SGD from two perspectives: the endpoint of SGD and the dynamics that lead up to it. For the endpoint, the experiments suggest the endpoint of SGD is similar under simultaneous rescaling of batch size and learning rate, and also that a higher ratio leads to flatter minima, both findings are consistent with our theoretical analysis. We note experimentally that the dynamics also seem to be similar under the same rescaling of learning rate and batch size, which we explore showing that one can exchange batch size and learning rate in a cyclical learning rate schedule. Next, we illustrate how noise affects memorization, showing that high noise levels lead to better generalization. Finally, we find experimentally that the similarity under simultaneous rescaling of learning rate and batch size breaks down if the learning rate gets too large or the batch size gets too small.
10	Most of the existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the mere extension of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to graphs. Generally, they consist of several steps of message passing between the nodes followed by a global indiscriminate feature pooling function. In many data-sets, however, the nodes are unlabeled or their labels provide no information about the similarity between the nodes and the locations of the nodes in the graph. Accordingly, message passing may not propagate helpful information throughout the graph. We show that this conventional approach can fail to learn to perform even simple graph classification tasks. We alleviate this serious shortcoming of the GNNs by making them a two step method. In the first of the proposed approach, a graph embedding algorithm is utilized to obtain a continuous feature vector for each node of the graph. The embedding algorithm represents the graph as a point-cloud in the embedding space. In the second step, the GNN is applied to the point-cloud representation of the graph provided by the embedding method. The GNN learns to perform the given task by inferring the topological structure of the graph encoded in the spatial distribution of the embedded vectors. In addition, we extend the proposed approach to the graph clustering problem and a new architecture for graph clustering is proposed. Moreover, the spatial representation of the graph is utilized to design a graph pooling algorithm. We turn the problem of graph down-sampling into a column sampling problem, i.e., the sampling algorithm selects a subset of the nodes whose feature vectors preserve the spatial distribution of all the feature vectors. We apply the proposed approach to several popular benchmark data-sets and it is shown that the proposed geometrical approach strongly improves the state-of-the-art result for several data-sets. For instance, for the PTC data-set, we improve the state-of-the-art result for more than 22 %.
10	Predicting the outcome of pharmacological assays based on high-resolution microscopyimages of treated cells is a crucial task in drug discovery which tremendouslyincreases discovery rates. However, end-to-end learning on these imageswith convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has not been ventured for this taskbecause it has been considered infeasible and overly complex. On the largestavailable public dataset, we compare several state-of-the-art CNNs trained in anend-to-end fashion with models based on a cell-centric approach involving segmentation.We found that CNNs operating on full images containing hundredsof cells perform significantly better at assay prediction than networks operatingon a single-cell level. Surprisingly, we could predict 29% of the 209 pharmacologicalassays at high predictive performance (AUC > 0.9). We compared anovel CNN architecture called ‚ÄúGapNet‚Äù against four competing CNN architecturesand found that it performs on par with the best methods and at the same timehas the lowest training time. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end learning onhigh-resolution imaging data is not only possible but even outperforms cell-centricand segmentation-dependent approaches. Hence, the costly cell segmentation andfeature extraction steps are not necessary, in fact they even hamper predictive performance.Our work further suggests that many pharmacological assays couldbe replaced by high-resolution microscopy imaging together with convolutionalneural networks.
10	Deep reinforcement learning requires a heavy price in terms of sample efficiency and overparameterization in the neural networks used for function approximation. In this work, we employ tensor factorization in order to learn more compact representations for reinforcement learning policies. We show empirically that in the low-data regime, it is possible to learn online policies with 2 to 10 times less total coefficients, with little to no loss of performance. We also leverage progress in second order optimization, and use the theory of wavelet scattering to further reduce the number of learned coefficients, by foregoing learning the topmost convolutional layer filters altogether. We evaluate our results on the Atari suite against recent baseline algorithms that represent the state-of-the-art in data efficiency, and get comparable results with an order of magnitude gain in weight parsimony.
01	To overcome the limitations of Neural Programmer-Interpreters (NPI) in its universality and learnability, we propose the incorporation of combinator abstraction into neural programing and a new NPI architecture to support this abstraction, which we call Combinatory Neural Programmer-Interpreter (CNPI). Combinator abstraction dramatically reduces the number and complexity of programs that need to be interpreted by the core controller of CNPI, while still allowing the CNPI to represent and interpret arbitrary complex programs by the collaboration of the core with the other components. We propose a small set of four combinators to capture the most pervasive programming patterns. Due to the finiteness and simplicity of this combinator set and the offloading of some burden of interpretation from the core, we are able construct a CNPI that is universal with respect to the set of all combinatorizable programs, which is adequate for solving most algorithmic tasks. Moreover, besides supervised training on execution traces, CNPI can be trained by policy gradient reinforcement learning with appropriately designed curricula.
01	We provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of gradient clipping in training deep neural networks. The key ingredient is a new smoothness condition derived from practical neural network training examples. We observe that gradient smoothness, a concept central to the analysis of first-order optimization algorithms that is often assumed to be a constant, demonstrates significant variability along the training trajectory of deep neural networks. Further, this smoothness positively correlates with the gradient norm, and contrary to standard assumptions in the literature, it can grow with the norm of the gradient. These empirical observations limit the applicability of existing theoretical analyses of algorithms that rely on a fixed bound on smoothness. These observations motivate us to introduce a novel relaxation of gradient smoothness that is weaker than the commonly used Lipschitz smoothness assumption. Under the new condition, we prove that two popular methods, namely, gradient clipping and normalized gradient, converge arbitrarily faster than gradient descent with fixed stepsize. We further explain why such adaptively scaled gradient methods can accelerate empirical convergence and verify our results empirically in popular neural network training settings.
01	Sequence-to-sequence models are commonly trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). However, standard MLE training considers a word-level objective, predicting the next word given the previous ground-truth partial sentence. This procedure focuses on modeling local syntactic patterns, and may fail to capture long-range semantic structure. We present a novel solution to alleviate these issues. Our approach imposes global sequence-level guidance via new supervision based on optimal transport, enabling the overall characterization and preservation of semantic features. We further show that this method can be understood as a Wasserstein gradient flow trying to match our model to the ground truth sequence distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the utility of the proposed approach, showing consistent improvements over a wide variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and image captioning.
10	Training reinforcement learning policies in partially observable domains with sparse reward signal is an important and open problem for the research community. In this paper, we introduce a new sequence-level intrinsic novelty model to tackle the challenge of training reinforcement learning policies in sparse rewarded partially observable domains. First, we propose a new reasoning paradigm to infer the novelty for the partially observable states, which is built upon forward dynamics prediction. Different from conventional approaches that perform self-prediction or one-step forward prediction, our proposed approach engages open-loop multi-step prediction, which enables the difficulty of novelty prediction to flexibly scale and thus results in high-quality novelty scores. Second, we propose a novel dual-LSTM architecture to facilitate the sequence-level reasoning over the partially observable state space.  Our proposed architecture efficiently synthesizes information from an observation sequence and an action sequence to derive meaningful latent representations for inferring the novelty for states. To evaluate the efficiency of our proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on several challenging 3D navigation tasks from ViZDoom and DeepMind Lab. We also present results on two hard-exploration domains from Atari 2600 series in Appendix to demonstrate our proposed approach could generalize beyond partially observable navigation tasks. Overall, the experiment results reveal that our proposed intrinsic novelty model could outperform several state-of-the-art curiosity baselines with considerable significance in the testified domains.
10	Deep generative models are capable of learning probability distributions over large, high-dimensional datasets such as images, video and natural language. Generative models trained on samples from p(x) ought to assign low likelihoods to out-of-distribution (OoD) samples from q(x), making them suitable for anomaly detection applications. We show that in practice, likelihood models are themselves susceptible to OoD errors, and even assign large likelihoods to images from other natural datasets. To mitigate these issues, we propose Generative Ensembles, a model-independent technique for OoD detection that combines density-based anomaly detection with uncertainty estimation. Our method outperforms ODIN and VIB baselines on image datasets, and achieves comparable performance to a classification model on the Kaggle Credit Fraud dataset.
01	Deep neural networks (DNNs) usually contain millions, maybe billions, of parameters/weights, making both storage and computation very expensive. This has motivated a large body of work to reduce the complexity of the neural network by using sparsity-inducing regularizers.  Another well-known approach for controlling the complexity of DNNs is parameter sharing/tying, where certain sets of weights are forced to share a common value. Some forms of weight sharing are hard-wired to express certain in- variances, with a notable example being the shift-invariance of convolutional layers. However, there may be other groups of weights that may be tied together during the learning process, thus further re- ducing the complexity of the network. In this paper, we adopt a recently proposed sparsity-inducing regularizer, named GrOWL (group ordered weighted l1), which encourages sparsity and, simulta- neously, learns which groups of parameters should share a common value. GrOWL has been proven effective in linear regression, being able to identify and cope with strongly correlated covariates. Unlike standard sparsity-inducing regularizers (e.g., l1 a.k.a. Lasso), GrOWL not only eliminates unimportant neurons by setting all the corresponding weights to zero, but also explicitly identifies strongly correlated neurons by tying the corresponding weights to a common value. This ability of GrOWL motivates the following two-stage procedure: (i) use GrOWL regularization in the training process to simultaneously identify significant neurons and groups of parameter that should be tied together; (ii) retrain the network, enforcing the structure that was unveiled in the previous phase, i.e., keeping only the significant neurons and enforcing the learned tying structure. We evaluate the proposed approach on several benchmark datasets, showing that it can dramatically compress the network with slight or even no loss on generalization performance.
10	Auto-encoders compress input data into a latent-space representation and reconstruct the original data from the representation. This latent representation is not easily interpreted by humans. In this paper, we propose training an auto-encoder that encodes input text into human-readable sentences. The auto-encoder is composed of a generator and a reconstructor. The generator encodes the input text into a shorter word sequence, and the reconstructor recovers the generator input from the generator output.To make the generator output human-readable, a discriminator restricts the output of the generator to resemble human-written sentences. By taking the generator output as the summary of the input text, abstractive summarization is achieved without document-summary pairs as training data. Promising results are shown on both English and Chinese corpora.
01	Humans understand novel sentences by composing meanings and roles of core language components. In contrast, neural network models for natural language modeling fail when such compositional generalization is required. The main contribution of this paper is to hypothesize that language compositionality is a form of group-equivariance. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a set of tools for constructing equivariant sequence-to-sequence models. Throughout a variety of experiments on the SCAN tasks, we analyze the behavior of existing models under the lens of equivariance, and demonstrate that our equivariant architecture is able to achieve the type compositional generalization required in human language understanding.
10	Deep neural networks trained on a wide range of datasets demonstrate impressive transferability. Deep features appear general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Such property is in prevalent use in real-world applications. A neural network pretrained on large datasets, such as ImageNet, can significantly boost generalization and accelerate training if fine-tuned to a smaller target dataset. Despite its pervasiveness, few effort has been devoted to uncovering the reason of transferability in deep feature representations. This paper tries to understand transferability from the perspectives of improved generalization, optimization and the feasibility of transferability. We demonstrate that 1) Transferred models tend to find flatter minima, since their weight matrices stay close to the original flat region of pretrained parameters when transferred to a similar target dataset; 2) Transferred representations make the loss landscape more favorable with improved Lipschitzness, which accelerates and stabilizes training substantially. The improvement largely attributes to the fact that the principal component of gradient is suppressed in the pretrained parameters, thus stabilizing the magnitude of gradient in back-propagation. 3) The feasibility of transferability is related to the similarity of both input and label. And a surprising discovery is that the feasibility is also impacted by the training stages in that the transferability first increases during training, and then declines. We further provide a theoretical analysis to verify our observations.
10	In this paper we prove new universal approximation theorems for deep learning on point clouds that do not assume fixed cardinality. We do this by first generalizing the classical universal approximation theorem to general compact Hausdorff spaces and then applying this to the permutation-invariant architectures presented in 'PointNet' (Qi et al) and 'Deep Sets' (Zaheer et al). Moreover, though both architectures operate on the same domain, we show that the constant functions are the only functions they can mutually uniformly approximate. In particular, DeepSets architectures cannot uniformly approximate the diameter function but can uniformly approximate the center of mass function but it is the other way around for PointNet. 
10	Recent research has proposed the lottery ticket hypothesis, suggesting that for a deep neural network, there exist trainable sub-networks performing equally or better than the original model with commensurate training steps. While this discovery is insightful, finding proper sub-networks requires iterative training and pruning. The high cost incurred limits the applications of the lottery ticket hypothesis. We show there exists a subset of the aforementioned sub-networks that converge significantly faster during the training process and thus can mitigate the cost issue. We conduct extensive experiments to show such sub-networks consistently exist across various model structures for a restrictive setting of hyperparameters (e.g., carefully selected learning rate, pruning ratio, and model capacity).  As a practical application of our findings, we demonstrate that such sub-networks can help in cutting down the total time of adversarial training, a standard approach to improve robustness, by up to 49% on CIFAR-10 to achieve the state-of-the-art robustness. 
10	This paper considers the growth in the length of one-dimensional trajectories as they are passed through deep ReLU neural networks,  which, among other things, is  one measure of the expressivity of deep networks. We generalise existing  results, providing an alternative, simpler method for lower bounding expected trajectory growth through random networks, for a more general class of weights distributions, including sparsely connected  networks. We illustrate this approach by deriving bounds for sparse-Gaussian, sparse-uniform, and sparse-discrete-valued random nets. We prove that trajectory growth can remain exponential in depth with these new distributions, including their sparse variants, with the sparsity parameter appearing in the base of the exponent.
10	CNNs are widely successful in recognizing human actions in videos, albeit with a great cost of computation. This cost is significantly higher in the case of long-range actions, where a video can span up to a few minutes, on average. The goal of this paper is to reduce the computational cost of these CNNs, without sacrificing their performance. We propose VideoEpitoma,  a neural network architecture comprising two modules: a timestamp selector and a video classifier. Given a long-range video of thousands of timesteps, the selector learns to choose only a few but most representative timesteps for the video. This selector resides on top of a lightweight CNN such as MobileNet and uses a novel gating module to take a binary decision: consider or discard a video timestep. This decision is conditioned on both the timestep-level feature and the video-level consensus. A heavyweight CNN model such as I3D takes the selected frames as input and performs video classification. Using off-the-shelf video classifiers, VideoEpitoma reduces the computation by up to 50\% without compromising the accuracy. In addition, we show that if trained end-to-end, the selector learns to make better choices to the benefit of the classifier, despite the selector and the classifier residing on two different CNNs. Finally, we report state-of-the-art results on two datasets for long-range action recognition: Charades and Breakfast Actions, with much-reduced computation. In particular, we match the accuracy of I3D by using less than half of the computation.
10	Low bit-width integer weights and activations are very important for efficient inference, especially with respect to lower power consumption. We propose to apply Monte Carlo methods and importance sampling to sparsify and quantize pre-trained neural networks without any retraining. We obtain sparse, low bit-width integer representations that approximate the full precision weights and activations. The precision, sparsity, and complexity are easily configurable by the amount of sampling performed. Our approach, called Monte Carlo Quantization (MCQ), is linear in both time and space, while the resulting quantized sparse networks show minimal accuracy loss compared to the original full-precision networks. Our method either outperforms or achieves results competitive with methods that do require additional training on a variety of challenging tasks.
10	Score-function-based text generation approaches such as REINFORCE, in general, suffer from high computational complexity and training instability problems. This is mainly due to the non-differentiable nature of the discrete space sampling and thus these methods have to treat the discriminator as a reward function and ignore the gradient information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, CaptainGAN, which adopts the straight-through gradient estimator and introduces a ‚Äùre-centered‚Äù gradient estimation technique to steer the generator toward better text tokens through the embedding space. Our method is stable to train and converges quickly without maximum likelihood pre-training. On multiple metrics of text quality and diversity, our method outperforms existing GAN-based methods on natural language generation.
01	Neural machine translation (NMT) models learn representations containing substantial linguistic information. However, it is not clear if such information is fully distributed or if some of it can be attributed to individual neurons. We develop unsupervised methods for discovering important neurons in NMT models. Our methods rely on the intuition that different models learn similar properties, and do not require any costly external supervision. We show experimentally that translation quality depends on the discovered neurons, and find that many of them capture common linguistic phenomena. Finally, we show how to control NMT translations in predictable ways, by modifying activations of individual neurons.
01	Adversarial examples are crafted with imperceptible perturbations with the intent to fool neural networks. Against such attacks, adversarial training and its variants stand as the strongest defense to date. Previous studies have pointed out that robust models that have undergone adversarial training tend to produce more salient and interpretable Jacobian matrices than their non-robust counterparts. A natural question is whether a model trained with an objective to produce salient Jacobian can result in better robustness. This paper answers this question with affirmative empirical results. We propose Jacobian Adversarially Regularized Networks (JARN) as a method to optimize the saliency of a classifier's Jacobian by adversarially regularizing the model's Jacobian to resemble natural training images. Image classifiers trained with JARN show improved robust accuracy compared to standard models on the MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets, uncovering a new angle to boost robustness without using adversarial training.
10	We focus on temporal self-supervision for GAN-based video generation tasks. While adversarial training successfully yields generative models for a variety of areas, temporal relationship in the generated data is much less explored. This is crucial for sequential generation tasks, e.g. video super-resolution and unpaired video translation. For the former, state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as L2 over adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads to temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For unpaired video translation, existing approaches modify the generator networks to form spatio-temporal cycle consistencies. In contrast, we focus on improving the learning objectives and propose a temporally self-supervised algorithm. For both tasks, we show that temporal adversarial learning is key to achieving temporally coherent solutions without sacrificing spatial detail. We also propose a novel Ping-Pong loss to improve the long-term temporal consistency. It effectively prevents recurrent networks from accumulating artifacts temporally without depressing detailed features. We also propose a first set of metrics to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy as well as the perceptual quality of the temporal evolution. A series of user studies confirms the rankings computed with these metrics.
10	We provide recovery guarantees for compressible signals that have been corrupted with noise and extend the framework introduced in \cite{bafna2018thwarting} to defend neural networks against $\ell_0$, $\ell_2$, and $\ell_{\infty}$-norm attacks. In the case of $\ell_0$-norm noise, we provide recovery guarantees for Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) and Basis Pursuit (BP). For $\ell_2$-norm bounded noise, we provide recovery guarantees for BP, and for the case of $\ell_\infty$-norm bounded noise, we provide recovery guarantees for Dantzig Selector (DS). These guarantees theoretically bolster the defense framework introduced in \cite{bafna2018thwarting} for defending neural networks against adversarial inputs. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of this defense framework against an array of $\ell_0$, $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$-norm attacks.   
10	Most classifiers operate by selecting the maximum of an estimate of the conditional distribution $p(y|x)$ where $x$ stands for the features of the instance to be classified and $y$ denotes its label. This often results in a hubristic bias: overconfidence in the assignment of a definite label. Usually, the observations are concentrated on a small volume but the classifier provides definite predictions for the entire space. We propose constructing conformal prediction sets which contain a set of labels rather than a single label. These conformal prediction sets contain the true label with probability $1-\alpha$. Our construction is based on $p(x|y)$ rather than $p(y|x)$ which results in a classifier that is very cautious: it outputs the null set --- meaning ``I don't know'' --- when the object does not resemble the training examples. An important property of our approach is that classes can be added or removed without having to retrain the classifier. We demonstrate the performance on the ImageNet ILSVRC dataset and the CelebA and IMDB-Wiki facial datasets using high dimensional features obtained from state of the art convolutional neural networks. 
10	Imitation learning provides an appealing framework for autonomous control: in many tasks, demonstrations of preferred behavior can be readily obtained from human experts, removing the need for costly and potentially dangerous online data collection in the real world. However, policies learned with imitation learning have limited flexibility to accommodate varied goals at test time. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers considerably more flexibility, since a predictive model learned from data can be used to achieve various goals at test time. However, MBRL suffers from two shortcomings. First, the model does not help to choose desired or safe outcomes -- its dynamics estimate only what is possible, not what is preferred. Second, MBRL typically requires additional online data collection to ensure that the model is accurate in those situations that are actually encountered when attempting to achieve test time goals. Collecting this data with a partially trained model can be dangerous and time-consuming. In this paper, we aim to combine the benefits of imitation learning and MBRL, and propose imitative models: probabilistic predictive models able to plan expert-like trajectories to achieve arbitrary goals. We find this method substantially outperforms both direct imitation and MBRL in a simulated autonomous driving task, and can be learned efficiently from a fixed set of expert demonstrations without additional online data collection. We also show our model can flexibly incorporate user-supplied costs at test-time, can plan to sequences of goals, and can even perform well with imprecise goals, including goals on the wrong side of the road.
10	We develop the Y-learner for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. The Y-learner is designed to leverage the abilities of neural networks to optimize multiple objectives and continually update, which allows for better pooling of underlying feature information between treatment and control groups. We evaluate the Y-learner on three test problems: (1) A set of six simulated data benchmarks from the literature. (2) A real-world large-scale experiment on voter persuasion. (3) A task from the literature that estimates artificially generated treatment effects on MNIST didgits. The Y-learner achieves state of the art results on two of the three tasks. On the MNIST task, it gets the second best results. 
10	The attention mechanism is an indispensable component of any state-of-the-art neural machine translation system. However, existing attention methods are often token-based and ignore the importance of phrasal alignments, which are the backbone of phrase-based statistical machine translation. We propose a novel phrase-based attention method to model n-grams of tokens as the basic attention entities, and design multi-headed phrasal attentions within the Transformer architecture to perform token-to-token and token-to-phrase mappings. Our approach yields improvements in English-German, English-Russian and English-French translation tasks on the standard WMT'14 test set. Furthermore, our phrasal attention method shows improvements on the one-billion-word language modeling benchmark.
01	We introduce a parameter sharing scheme, in which different layers of a convolutional neural network (CNN) are defined by a learned linear combination of parameter tensors from a global bank of templates.  Restricting the number of templates yields a flexible hybridization of traditional CNNs and recurrent networks.  Compared to traditional CNNs, we demonstrate substantial parameter savings on standard image classification tasks, while maintaining accuracy.Our simple parameter sharing scheme, though defined via soft weights, in practice often yields trained networks with near strict recurrent structure; with negligible side effects, they convert into networks with actual loops. Training these networks thus implicitly involves discovery of suitable recurrent architectures. Though considering only the aspect of recurrent links, our trained networks achieve accuracy competitive with those built using state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) procedures.Our hybridization of recurrent and convolutional networks may also represent a beneficial architectural bias.  Specifically, on synthetic tasks which are algorithmic in nature, our hybrid networks both train faster and extrapolate better to test examples outside the span of the training set.
10	Multi-view recognition is the task of classifying an object from multi-view image sequences. Instead of using a single-view for classification, humans generally navigate around a target object to learn its multi-view representation. Motivated by this human behavior, the next best view can be learned by combining object recognition with navigation in complex environments. Since deep reinforcement learning has proven successful in navigation tasks, we propose a novel multi-task reinforcement learning framework for joint multi-view recognition and navigation. Our method uses a hierarchical action space for multi-task reinforcement learning. The framework was evaluated with an environment created from the ModelNet40 dataset. Our results show improvements on object recognition and demonstrate human-like behavior on navigation.
10	First-order adaptive optimization algorithms such as Adam play an important role in modern deep learning due to their super fast convergence speed in solving large scale optimization problems. However, Adam's non-convergence behavior and regrettable generalization ability make it fall into a love-hate relationship to deep learning community. Previous studies on Adam and its variants (refer as Adam-Type algorithms) mainly rely on theoretical regret bound analysis, which overlook the natural characteristic reside in such algorithms and limit our thinking. In this paper, we aim at seeking a different interpretation of Adam-Type algorithms so that we can intuitively comprehend and improve them. The way we chose is based on a traditional online convex optimization algorithm scheme known as mirror descent method. By bridging Adam and mirror descent, we receive a clear map of the functionality of each part in Adam. In addition, this new angle brings us a new insight on identifying the non-convergence issue of Adam. Moreover, we provide new variant of Adam-Type algorithm, namely AdamAL which can naturally mitigate the non-convergence issue of Adam and improve its performance. We further conduct experiments on various popular deep learning tasks and models, and the results are quite promising.
10	Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used for classifying graph nodes in the semi-supervised setting.Previous works have shown that GCNs are vulnerable to the perturbation on adjacency and feature matrices of existing nodes. However, it is unrealistic to change the connections of  existing nodes in many applications, such as existing users in social networks. In this paper, we investigate methods attacking GCNs by adding fake nodes. A greedy algorithm is proposed to generate adjacency and feature matrices of fake nodes, aiming to minimize the classification accuracy on the existing ones. In additional, we introduce a discriminator to classify fake nodes from real nodes, and propose a Greedy-GAN algorithm to simultaneously update the discriminator and the attacker, to make fake nodes indistinguishable to the real ones.  Our non-targeted attack decreases the accuracy of GCN down to 0.10, and our targeted attack reaches a success rate of 0.99 for attacking the whole datasets, and 0.94 on average for attacking a single node.
10	Localist coding schemes are more easily interpretable than the distributed schemes but generally believed to be biologically implausible. Recent results have found highly selective units and object detectors in NNs that are indicative of local codes (LCs). Here we undertake a constructionist study on feed-forward NNs and find LCs emerging in response to invariant features, and this finding is robust until the invariant feature is perturbed by 40%. Decreasing the number of input data, increasing the relative weight of the invariant features and large values of dropout all increase the number of LCs. Longer training times increase the number of LCs and the turning point of the LC-epoch curve correlates well with the point at which NNs reach 90-100% on both test and training accuracy. Pseudo-deep networks (2 hidden layers) which have many LCs lose them when common aspects of deep-NN research are applied (large training data, ReLU activations, early stopping on training accuracy and softmax), suggesting that LCs may not be found in deep-NNs. Switching to more biologically feasible constraints (sigmoidal activation functions, longer training times, dropout, activation noise) increases the number of LCs. If LCs are not found in the feed-forward classification layers of modern deep-CNNs these data suggest this could either be caused by a lack of (moderately) invariant features being passed to the fully connected layers or due to the choice of training conditions and architecture. Should the interpretability and resilience to noise of LCs be required, this work suggests how to tune a NN so they emerge. 
01	 Current end-to-end machine reading and question answering (Q\&A) models are primarily based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with attention. Despite their success, these models are often slow for both training and inference due to the sequential nature of RNNs. We propose a new Q\&A architecture called QANet, which does not require recurrent networks:  Its encoder consists exclusively of convolution and self-attention, where convolution models local interactions and self-attention models global interactions. On the SQuAD dataset, our model is 3x to 13x faster in training and 4x to 9x faster in inference, while achieving equivalent accuracy to recurrent models. The speed-up gain allows us to train the model with much more data. We hence combine our model with data generated by backtranslation from a neural machine translation model. On the SQuAD dataset, our single model, trained with augmented data, achieves 84.6 F1 score on the test set, which is significantly better than the best published F1 score of 81.8.
01	Despite the state-of-the-art accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in various classification problems, their deployment onto resource constrained edge computing devices remains challenging due to their large size and complexity. Several recent studies have reported remarkable results in reducing this complexity through quantization of DNN models. However, these studies usually do not consider the changes in the loss function when performing quantization, nor do they take the different importances of DNN model parameters to the accuracy into account. We address these issues in this paper by proposing a new method, called adaptive quantization, which simplifies a trained DNN model by finding a unique, optimal precision for each network parameter such that the increase in loss is minimized. The optimization problem at the core of this method iteratively uses the loss function gradient to determine an error margin for each parameter and assigns it a precision accordingly. Since this problem uses linear functions, it is computationally cheap and, as we will show, has a closed-form approximate solution. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR, and SVHN datasets showed that the proposed method can achieve near or better than state-of-the-art reduction in model size with similar error rates. Furthermore, it can achieve compressions close to floating-point model compression methods without loss of accuracy.
01	Neural language models have been widely used in various NLP tasks, including machine translation, next word prediction and conversational agents. However, it is challenging to deploy these models on mobile devices due to their slow prediction speed, where the bottleneck is to compute top candidates in the softmax layer. In this paper, we introduce a novel softmax layer approximation algorithm by exploiting the clustering structure of context vectors. Our algorithm uses a light-weight screening model to predict a much smaller set of candidate words based on the given context, and then conducts an exact softmax only within that subset. Training such a procedure end-to-end is challenging as traditional clustering methods are discrete and non-differentiable, and thus unable to be used with back-propagation in the training process. Using the Gumbel softmax, we are able to train the screening model end-to-end on the training set to exploit data distribution. The algorithm achieves an order of magnitude faster inference than the original softmax layer for predicting top-k words in various tasks such as beam search in machine translation or next words prediction. For example, for machine translation task on German to English dataset with around 25K vocabulary, we can achieve 20.4 times speed up with 98.9% precision@1 and 99.3% precision@5 with the original softmax layer prediction, while state-of-the-art (Zhang et al., 2018) only achieves 6.7x speedup with 98.7% precision@1 and 98.1% precision@5 for the same task.
10	Many works have been proposed in the literature to capture the dynamics of diffusion in networks. While some of them define graphical markovian models to extract temporal relationships between node infections in networks, others consider diffusion episodes as sequences of infections via recurrent neural models. In this paper we propose a model at the crossroads of these two extremes, which embeds the history of diffusion in infected nodes as hidden continuous states. Depending on the trajectory followed by the content before reaching a given node, the distribution of influence probabilities may vary. However, content trajectories  are usually hidden in the data, which induces challenging learning problems. We propose a topological recurrent neural model which exhibits good experimental performances for diffusion modelling and prediction. 
10	  The problem of adversarial examples has shown that modern Neural Network (NN) models could be rather fragile. Among the most promising techniques to solve the problem, one is to require the model to be {\it $\epsilon$-adversarially robust} (AR); that is, to require the model not to change predicted labels when any given input examples are perturbed within a certain range. However, it is widely observed that such methods would lead to standard performance degradation, i.e., the degradation on natural examples.  In this work, we study the degradation through the regularization perspective.  We identify quantities from generalization analysis of NNs; with the identified quantities we empirically find that AR is achieved by regularizing/biasing NNs towards less confident solutions by making the changes in the feature space (induced by changes in the instance space) of most layers smoother uniformly in all directions; so to a certain extent, it prevents sudden change in prediction w.r.t.  perturbations. However, the end result of such smoothing concentrates samples around decision boundaries, resulting in less confident solutions, and leads to worse standard performance.  Our studies suggest that one might consider ways that build AR into NNs in a gentler way to avoid the problematic regularization.
01	Computer simulation provides an automatic and safe way for training robotic controlpolicies to achieve complex tasks such as locomotion. However, a policytrained in simulation usually does not transfer directly to the real hardware dueto the differences between the two environments. Transfer learning using domainrandomization is a promising approach, but it usually assumes that the target environmentis close to the distribution of the training environments, thus relyingheavily on accurate system identification. In this paper, we present a differentapproach that leverages domain randomization for transferring control policies tounknown environments. The key idea that, instead of learning a single policy inthe simulation, we simultaneously learn a family of policies that exhibit differentbehaviors. When tested in the target environment, we directly search for the bestpolicy in the family based on the task performance, without the need to identifythe dynamic parameters. We evaluate our method on five simulated robotic controlproblems with different discrepancies in the training and testing environmentand demonstrate that our method can overcome larger modeling errors comparedto training a robust policy or an adaptive policy.
10	Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are difficult to train on sequence processing tasks, not only because input noise may be amplified through feedback, but also because any inaccuracy in the weights has similar consequences as input noise. We describe a method for denoising the hidden state during training to achieve more robust representations thereby improving generalization performance. Attractor dynamics are incorporated into the hidden state to `clean up' representations at each step of a sequence. The attractor dynamics are trained through an auxillary denoising loss to recover previously experienced hidden states from noisy versions of those states. This state-denoised recurrent neural network (SDRNN) performs multiple steps of internal processing for each external sequence step. On a range of tasks, we show that the SDRNN outperforms a generic RNN as well as a variant of the SDRNN with attractor dynamics on the hidden state but without the auxillary loss. We argue that attractor dynamics---and corresponding connectivity constraints---are an essential component of the deep learning arsenal and should be invoked not only for recurrent networks but also for improving deep feedforward nets and intertask transfer.
01	A central question of representation learning asks under which conditions it is possible to reconstruct the true latent variables of an arbitrarily complex generative process. Recent breakthrough work by Khemakhem et al. (2019) on nonlinear ICA has answered this question for a broad class of conditional generative processes. We extend this important result in a direction relevant for application to real-world data. First, we generalize the theory to the case of unknown intrinsic problem dimension and prove that in some special (but not very restrictive) cases, informative latent variables will be automatically separated from noise by an estimating model. Furthermore, the recovered informative latent variables will be in one-to-one correspondence with the true latent variables of the generating process, up to a trivial component-wise transformation. Second, we introduce a modification of the RealNVP invertible neural network architecture (Dinh et al. (2016)) which is particularly suitable for this type of problem: the General Incompressible-flow Network (GIN). Experiments on artificial data and EMNIST demonstrate that theoretical predictions are indeed verified in practice. In particular, we provide a detailed set of exactly 22 informative latent variables extracted from EMNIST.
01	We present a new approach to 3D object representation where a neural network encodes the geometry of an object directly into the weights and biases of a second 'mapping' network. This mapping network can be used to reconstruct an object by applying its encoded transformation to points randomly sampled from a simple geometric space, such as the unit sphere. We study the effectiveness of our method through various experiments on subsets of the ShapeNet dataset. We find that the proposed approach can reconstruct encoded objects with accuracy equal to or exceeding state-of-the-art methods with orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Our smallest mapping network has only about 7000 parameters and shows reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art object decoder architectures with millions of parameters. Further experiments on feature mixing through the composition of learned functions show that the encoding captures a meaningful subspace of objects.
10	At internet scale, applications collect a tremendous amount of data by logging user events, analyzing text, and collecting images. This data powers a variety of machine learning models for tasks such as image classification, language modeling, content recommendation, and advertising. However, training large models over all available data can be computationally expensive, creating a bottleneck in the development of new machine learning models. In this work, we develop a novel approach to efficiently select a subset of training data to achieve faster training with no loss in model predictive performance. In our approach, we first train a small proxy model quickly, which we then use to estimate the utility of individual training data points, and then select the most informative ones for training the large target model. Extensive experiments show that our approach leads to a 1.6x and 1.8x speed-up on CIFAR10 and SVHN by selecting 60% and 50% subsets of the data, while maintaining the predictive performance of the model trained on the entire dataset.
01	Generative models that can model and predict sequences of future events can, in principle, learn to capture complex real-world phenomena, such as physical interactions. However, a central challenge in video prediction is that the future is highly uncertain: a sequence of past observations of events can imply many possible futures. Although a number of recent works have studied probabilistic models that can represent uncertain futures, such models are either extremely expensive computationally as in the case of pixel-level autoregressive models, or do not directly optimize the likelihood of the data. To our knowledge, our work is the first to propose multi-frame video prediction with normalizing flows, which allows for direct optimization of the data likelihood, and produces high-quality stochastic predictions. We describe an approach for modeling the latent space dynamics, and demonstrate that flow-based generative models offer a viable and competitive approach to generative modeling of video.
01	Deep generative models have achieved impressive success in recent years. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), as powerful frameworks for deep generative model learning, have largely been considered as two distinct paradigms and received extensive independent studies respectively. This paper aims to establish formal connections between GANs and VAEs through a new formulation of them. We interpret sample generation in GANs as performing posterior inference, and show that GANs and VAEs involve minimizing KL divergences of respective posterior and inference distributions with opposite directions, extending the two learning phases of classic wake-sleep algorithm, respectively. The unified view provides a powerful tool to analyze a diverse set of existing model variants, and enables to transfer techniques across research lines in a principled way. For example, we apply the importance weighting method in VAE literatures for improved GAN learning, and enhance VAEs with an adversarial mechanism that leverages generated samples. Experiments show generality and effectiveness of the transfered techniques. 
10	Automatically feature generation is a major topic of automated machine learning. Among various feature generation approaches, feature crossing, which takes cross-product of sparse features, is a promising way to effectively capture the interactions among categorical features in tabular data. Previous works on feature crossing try to search in the set of all the possible cross feature fields. This is obviously not efficient when the size of original feature fields is large. Meanwhile, some deep learning-based methods combines deep neural networks and various interaction components. However, due to the existing of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), only a few cross features can be explicitly generated by the interaction components. Recently, piece-wise interpretation of DNN has been widely studied, and the piece-wise interpretations are usually inconsistent in different samples. Inspired by this, we give a definition of interpretation inconsistency in DNN, and propose a novel method called CrossGO, which selects useful cross features according to the interpretation inconsistency. The whole process of learning feature crossing can be done via simply training a DNN model and a logistic regression (LR) model. CrossGO can generate compact candidate set of cross feature fields, and promote the efficiency of searching. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several real-world datasets. Cross features generated by CrossGO can empower a simple LR model achieving approximate or even better performances comparing with complex DNN models.
10	Point clouds are a flexible and ubiquitous way to represent 3D objects with arbitrary resolution and precision. Previous work has shown that adapting encoder networks to match the semantics of their input point clouds can significantly improve their effectiveness over naive feedforward alternatives. However, the vast majority of work on point-cloud decoders are still based on fully-connected networks that map shape representations to a fixed number of output points. In this work, we investigate decoder architectures that more closely match the semantics of variable sized point clouds. Specifically, we study sample-based point-cloud decoders that map a shape representation to a point feature distribution, allowing an arbitrary number of sampled features to be transformed into individual output points. We develop three sample-based decoder architectures and compare their performance to each other and show their improved effectiveness over feedforward architectures. In addition, we investigate the learned distributions to gain insight into the output transformation. Our work is available as an extensible software platform to reproduce these results and serve as a baseline for future work.
10	To perform robot manipulation tasks, a low-dimensional state of the environment typically needs to be estimated. However, designing a state estimator can sometimes be difficult, especially in environments with deformable objects. An alternative is to learn an end-to-end policy that maps directly from high-dimensional sensor inputs to actions. However, if this policy is trained with reinforcement learning, then without a state estimator, it is hard to specify a reward function based on high-dimensional observations. To meet this challenge, we propose a simple indicator reward function for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning: we only give a positive reward when the robot's observation exactly matches a target goal observation. We show that by relabeling the original goal with the achieved goal to obtain positive rewards (Andrychowicz et al., 2017), we can learn with the indicator reward function even in continuous state spaces. We propose two methods to further speed up convergence with indicator rewards: reward balancing and reward filtering. We show comparable performance between our method and an oracle which uses the ground-truth state for computing rewards. We show that our method can perform complex tasks in continuous state spaces such as rope manipulation from RGB-D images, without knowledge of the ground-truth state.
01	Learning in environments with large state and action spaces, and sparse rewards, can hinder a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent‚Äôs learning through trial-and-error. For instance, following natural language instructions on the Web (such as booking a flight ticket) leads to RL settings where input vocabulary and number of actionable elements on a page can grow very large. Even though recent approaches improve the success rate on relatively simple environments with the help of human demonstrations to guide the exploration, they still fail in environments where the set of possible instructions can reach millions. We approach the aforementioned problems from a different perspective and propose guided RL approaches that can generate unbounded amount of experience for an agent to learn from. Instead of learning from a complicated instruction with a large vocabulary, we decompose it into multiple sub-instructions and schedule a curriculum in which an agent is tasked with a gradually increasing subset of these relatively easier sub-instructions. In addition, when the expert demonstrations are not available, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that generates new instruction following tasks and trains the agent more effectively. We train DQN, deep reinforcement learning agent, with Q-value function approximated with a novel QWeb neural network architecture on these smaller, synthetic instructions. We evaluate the ability of our agent to generalize to new instructions onWorld of Bits benchmark, on forms with up to 100 elements, supporting 14 million possible instructions. The QWeb agent outperforms the baseline without using any human demonstration achieving 100% success rate on several difficult environments.
10	Symbolic logic allows practitioners to build systems that perform rule-based reasoning which is interpretable and which can easily be augmented with prior knowledge. However, such systems are traditionally difficult to apply to problems involving natural language due to the large linguistic variability of language. Currently, most work in natural language processing focuses on neural networks which learn distributed representations of words and their composition, thereby performing well in the presence of large linguistic variability. We propose to reap the benefits of both approaches by applying a combination of neural networks and logic programming to natural language question answering. We propose to employ an external, non-differentiable Prolog prover which utilizes a similarity function over pretrained sentence encoders. We fine-tune these representations via Evolution Strategies with the goal of multi-hop reasoning on natural language.  This allows us to create a system that can apply rule-based reasoning to natural language and induce domain-specific natural language rules from training data. We evaluate the proposed system on two different question answering tasks, showing that it complements two very strong baselines ‚Äì BIDAF (Seo et al., 2016a) and FASTQA (Weissenborn et al.,2017) ‚Äì and outperforms both when used in an ensemble.
10	Energy  based  models  outputs  unmormalized  log-probability  values  given  datasamples.  Such a estimation is essential in a variety of application problems suchas sample generation, denoising, sample restoration, outlier detection, Bayesianreasoning, and many more.  However, standard maximum likelihood training iscomputationally expensive due to the requirement of sampling model distribution.Score matching potentially alleviates this problem, and denoising score matching(Vincent, 2011) is a particular convenient version.  However,  previous attemptsfailed to produce models capable of high quality sample synthesis.  We believethat  it  is  because  they  only  performed  denoising  score  matching  over  a  singlenoise scale. To overcome this limitation, here we instead learn an energy functionusing all noise scales.   When sampled using Annealed Langevin dynamics andsingle step denoising jump, our model produced high-quality samples comparableto state-of-the-art techniques such as GANs, in addition to assigning likelihood totest data comparable to previous likelihood models.  Our model set a new sam-ple quality baseline in likelihood-based models.  We further demonstrate that our model learns sample distribution and generalize well on an image inpainting tasks.
01	In this paper we investigate the family of functions representable by deep neural networks (DNN) with rectified linear units (ReLU). We give an algorithm to train a ReLU DNN with one hidden layer to {\em global optimality} with runtime polynomial in the data size albeit exponential in the input dimension. Further, we improve on the known lower bounds on size (from exponential to super exponential) for approximating a ReLU deep net function by a shallower ReLU net. Our gap theorems hold for smoothly parametrized families of ``hard'' functions, contrary to countable, discrete families known in the literature.  An example consequence of our gap theorems is the following: for every natural number $k$ there exists a function representable by a ReLU DNN with $k^2$ hidden layers and total size $k^3$, such that any ReLU DNN with at most $k$ hidden layers will require at least $\frac12k^{k+1}-1$ total nodes. Finally, for the family of $\R^n\to \R$ DNNs with ReLU activations, we show a new lowerbound on the number of affine pieces, which is larger than previous constructions in certain regimes of the network architecture and most distinctively our lowerbound is demonstrated by an explicit construction of a \emph{smoothly parameterized} family of functions attaining this scaling. Our construction utilizes the theory of zonotopes from polyhedral theory.
10	In medicine, both ethical and monetary costs of incorrect predictions can be significant, and the complexity of the problems often necessitates increasingly complex models. Recent work has shown that changing just the random seed is enough for otherwise well-tuned deep neural networks to vary in their individual predicted probabilities. In light of this, we investigate the role of model uncertainty methods in the medical domain. Using RNN ensembles and various Bayesian RNNs, we show that population-level metrics, such as AUC-PR, AUC-ROC, log-likelihood, and calibration error, do not capture model uncertainty. Meanwhile, the presence of significant variability in patient-specific predictions and optimal decisions motivates the need for capturing model uncertainty. Understanding the uncertainty for individual patients is an area with clear clinical impact, such as determining when a model decision is likely to be brittle. We further show that RNNs with only Bayesian embeddings can be a more efficient way to capture model uncertainty compared to ensembles, and we analyze how model uncertainty is impacted across individual input features and patient subgroups.
10	The transformer has become a central model for many NLP tasks from translation to language modeling to representation learning. Its success demonstrates the effectiveness of stacked attention as a replacement for recurrence for many tasks. In theory attention also offers more insights into the model‚Äôs internal decisions; however, in practice when stacked it quickly becomes nearly as fully-connected as recurrent models. In this work, we propose an alternative transformer architecture, discrete transformer, with the goal of better separating out internal model decisions. The model uses hard attention to ensure that each step only depends on a fixed context. Additionally, the model uses a separate ‚Äúsyntactic‚Äù controller to separate out network structure from decision making. Finally we show that this approach can be further sparsified with direct regularization. Empirically, this approach is able to maintain the same level of performance on several datasets, while discretizing reasoning decisions over the data.
10	Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) has been a default module in  modern deep networks  due to its effectiveness for accelerating training deep neural networks.  It is widely accepted that the great success of BatchNorm is owing to reduction of internal covariate shift (ICS), but recently it is demonstrated that the link between them is fairly weak. The intrinsic reason behind effectiveness of BatchNorm is still unrevealed that limits it to be made better use. In light of this,  we propose a new normalization approach,  referred to as Pre-Operation Normalization (POP-Norm), which is theoretically ensured to speed up the training convergence. Not surprisingly, POP-Norm and BatchNorm are largely the same. Hence the similarities  can help us to theoretically interpret the root of BatchNorm's effectiveness. There are still some significant distinctions between the two approaches. Just the distinctions make POP-Norm achieve faster convergence rate and better performance than BatchNorm, which are validated in extensive experiments on benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2012.
01	The modeling of style when synthesizing natural human speech from text has been the focus of significant attention. Some state-of-the-art approaches train an encoder-decoder network on paired text and audio samples (x_txt, x_aud) by encouraging its output to reconstruct x_aud. The synthesized audio waveform is expected to contain the verbal content of x_txt and the auditory style of x_aud. Unfortunately, modeling style in TTS is somewhat under-determined and training models with a reconstruction loss alone is insufficient to disentangle content and style from other factors of variation. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end TTS model that offers enhanced content-style disentanglement ability and controllability. We achieve this by combining a pairwise training procedure, an adversarial game, and a collaborative game into one training scheme. The adversarial game concentrates the true data distribution, and the collaborative game minimizes the distance between real samples and generated samples in both the original space and the latent space. As a result, the proposed model delivers a highly controllable generator, and a disentangled representation. Benefiting from the separate modeling of style and content, our model can generate human fidelity speech that satisfies the desired style conditions. Our model achieves start-of-the-art results across multiple tasks, including style transfer (content and style swapping), emotion modeling, and identity transfer (fitting a new speaker's voice).
10	Training neural-networks is computationally hard. However, in practice they are trained efficiently using gradient-based algorithms, achieving remarkable performance on natural data. To bridge this gap, we observe the property of local correlation: correlation between small patterns of the input and the target label. We focus on learning deep neural-networks with a variant of gradient-descent, when the target function is a tree-structured Boolean circuit. We show that in this case, the existence of correlation between the gates of the circuit and the target label determines whether the optimization succeeds or fails. Using this result, we show that neural-networks can learn the (log n)-parity problem for most product distributions. These results hint that local correlation may play an important role in differentiating between distributions that are hard or easy to learn.
10	Self-explaining models are models that reveal decision making parameters in an interpretable manner so that the model reasoning process can be directly understood by human beings. General Linear Models (GLMs) are self-explaining because the model weights directly show how each feature contributes to the output value. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are in general not self-explaining due to the non-linearity of the activation functions, complex architectures, obscure feature extraction and transformation process. In this work, we illustrate the fact that existing deep architectures are hard to interpret because each hidden layer carries a mix of low level features and high level features. As a solution, we propose a novel feature leveling architecture that isolates low level features from high level features on a per-layer basis to better utilize the GLM layer in the proposed architecture for interpretation. Experimental results show that our modified models are able to achieve competitive results comparing to main-stream architectures on standard datasets while being more self-explainable. Our implementations and configurations are publicly available for reproductions.
10	Recurrent neural networks can be difficult to train on long sequence data due to the well-known vanishing gradient problem. Some architectures incorporate methods to reduce RNN state updates, therefore allowing the network to preserve memory over long temporal intervals. To address these problems of convergence, this paper proposes a timing-gated LSTM RNN model, called the Gaussian-gated LSTM (g-LSTM). The time gate controls when a neuron can be updated during training, enabling longer memory persistence and better error-gradient flow. This model captures long-temporal dependencies better than an LSTM and the time gate parameters can be learned even from non-optimal initialization values. Because the time gate limits the updates of the neuron state, the number of computes needed for the network update is also reduced. By adding a computational budget term to the training loss, we can obtain a network which further reduces the number of computes by at least 10x. Finally, by employing a temporal curriculum learning schedule for the g-LSTM, we can reduce the convergence time of the equivalent LSTM network on long sequences.
01	Autoencoder-based learning has emerged as a staple for disciplining representations in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. This paper analyzes a framework for improving generalization in a purely supervised setting, where the target space is high-dimensional. We motivate and formalize the general framework of target-embedding autoencoders (TEA) for supervised prediction, learning intermediate latent representations jointly optimized to be both predictable from features as well as predictive of targets---encoding the prior that variations in targets are driven by a compact set of underlying factors. As our theoretical contribution, we provide a guarantee of generalization for linear TEAs by demonstrating uniform stability, interpreting the benefit of the auxiliary reconstruction task as a form of regularization. As our empirical contribution, we extend validation of this approach beyond existing static classification applications to multivariate sequence forecasting, verifying their advantage on both linear and nonlinear recurrent architectures---thereby underscoring the further generality of this framework beyond feedforward instantiations.
10	A new statistical procedure (CandeÃÄs,2018) has provided a way to identify important factors using any supervised learning method controlling for FDR. This line of research has shown great potential to expand the horizon of machine learning methods beyond the task of prediction, to serve the broader need for scientific researches for interpretable findings. However, the lack of a practical and flexible method to generate knockoffs remains the major obstacle for wide application of  Model-X procedure. This paper fills in the gap by proposing a model-free knockoff generator which approximates the correlation structure between features through latent variable representation. We demonstrate our proposed method can achieve FDR control and better power than two existing methods in various simulated settings and a real data example for finding mutations associated with drug resistance in HIV-1 patients.
10	This paper studies the problem of domain division which aims to segment instances drawn from different probabilistic distributions. This problem exists in many previous recognition tasks, such as Open Set Learning (OSL) and Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (G-ZSL), where the testing instances come from either seen or unseen/novel classes with different probabilistic distributions. Previous works only calibrate the conÔ¨Ådent prediction of classiÔ¨Åers of seen classes (WSVM Scheirer et al. (2014)) or taking unseen classes as outliers Socher et al. (2013). In contrast, this paper proposes a probabilistic way of directly estimating and Ô¨Åne-tuning the decision boundary between seen and unseen classes. In particular, we propose a domain division algorithm to split the testing instances into known, unknown and uncertain domains, and then conduct recognition tasks in each domain. Two statistical tools, namely, bootstrapping and KolmogorovSmirnov (K-S) Test, for the Ô¨Årst time, are introduced to uncover and Ô¨Åne-tune the decision boundary of each domain. Critically, the uncertain domain is newly introduced in our framework to adopt those instances whose domain labels cannot be predicted conÔ¨Ådently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieved the state-of-the-art performance on OSL and G-ZSL benchmarks.
01	With the proliferation of specialized neural network processors that operate on low-precision integers, the performance of Deep Neural Network inference becomes increasingly dependent on the result of quantization. Despite plenty of prior work on the quantization of weights or activations for neural networks, there is still a wide gap between the software quantizers and the low-precision accelerator implementation, which degrades either the efficiency of networks or that of the hardware for the lack of software and hardware coordination at design-phase. In this paper, we propose a learned linear symmetric quantizer for integer neural network processors, which not only quantizes neural parameters and activations to low-bit integer but also accelerates hardware inference by using batch normalization fusion and low-precision accumulators (e.g., 16-bit) and multipliers (e.g., 4-bit). We use a unified way to quantize weights and activations, and the results outperform many previous approaches for various networks such as AlexNet, ResNet, and lightweight models like MobileNet while keeping friendly to the accelerator architecture. Additional, we also apply the method to object detection models and witness high performance and accuracy in YOLO-v2. Finally, we deploy the quantized models on our specialized integer-arithmetic-only DNN accelerator to show the effectiveness of the proposed quantizer. We show that even with linear symmetric quantization, the results can be better than asymmetric or non-linear methods in 4-bit networks. In evaluation, the proposed quantizer induces less than 0.4\% accuracy drop in ResNet18, ResNet34, and AlexNet when quantizing the whole network as required by the integer processors.
10	Ability to quantify and predict progression of a disease is fundamental for selecting an appropriate treatment. Many clinical metrics cannot be acquired frequently either because of their cost (e.g. MRI, gait analysis) or because they are inconvenient or harmful to a patient (e.g. biopsy, x-ray). In such scenarios, in order to estimate individual trajectories of disease progression, it is advantageous to leverage similarities between patients, i.e. the covariance of trajectories, and find a latent representation of progression. Most of existing methods for estimating trajectories do not account for events in-between observations, what dramatically decreases their adequacy for clinical practice. In this study, we develop a machine learning framework named Coordinatewise-Soft-Impute (CSI) for analyzing disease progression from sparse observations in the presence of confounding events. CSI is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum of the corresponding optimization problem. Experimental results also demonstrates the effectiveness of CSI using both simulated and real dataset.
01	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are powerful tools for solving sequence-based problems, but their efficacy and execution time are dependent on the size of the network.  Following recent work in simplifying these networks with model pruning and a novel mapping of work onto GPUs, we design an efficient implementation for sparse RNNs.  We investigate several optimizations and tradeoffs: Lamport timestamps, wide memory loads, and a bank-aware weight layout.  With these optimizations, we achieve speedups of over 6x over the next best algorithm for a hidden layer of size 2304, batch size of 4, and a density of 30%.  Further, our technique allows for models of over 5x the size to fit on a GPU for a speedup of 2x, enabling larger networks to help advance the state-of-the-art.  We perform case studies on NMT and speech recognition tasks in the appendix, accelerating their recurrent layers by up to 3x.
01	We provide a framework for incorporating robustness -- to perturbations in the transition dynamics which we refer to as model misspecification -- into continuous control Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. We specifically focus on incorporating robustness into a state-of-the-art continuous control RL algorithm called Maximum a-posteriori Policy Optimization (MPO). We achieve this by learning a policy that optimizes for a worst case, entropy-regularized, expected return objective and derive a corresponding robust entropy-regularized Bellman contraction operator. In addition, we introduce a less conservative, soft-robust, entropy-regularized objective with a corresponding Bellman operator. We show that both, robust and soft-robust policies, outperform their non-robust counterparts in nine Mujoco domains with environment perturbations. In addition, we show improved robust performance on a challenging, simulated, dexterous robotic hand. Finally, we present multiple investigative experiments that provide a deeper insight into the robustness framework; including an adaptation to another continuous control RL algorithm. Performance videos can be found online at https://sites.google.com/view/robust-rl.
10	Contextualized word representations such as ELMo and BERT have become the de facto starting point for incorporating pretrained representations for downstream NLP tasks. In these settings, contextual representations have largely made obsolete their static embedding predecessors such as Word2Vec and GloVe. However, static embeddings do have their advantages in that they are straightforward to understand and faster to use. Additionally, embedding analysis methods for static embeddings are far more diverse and mature than those available for their dynamic counterparts. In this work, we introduce simple methods for generating static lookup table embeddings from existing pretrained contextual representations and demonstrate they outperform Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings on a variety of word similarity and word relatedness tasks. In doing so, our results also reveal insights that may be useful for subsequent downstream tasks using our embeddings or the original contextual models. Further, we demonstrate the increased potential for analysis by applying existing approaches for estimating social bias in word embeddings. Our analysis constitutes the most comprehensive study of social bias in contextual word representations (via the proxy of our distilled embeddings) and reveals a number of inconsistencies in current techniques for quantifying social bias in word embeddings. We publicly release our code and distilled word embeddings to support reproducible research and the broader NLP community. 
10	Discovering objects and their attributes is of great importance for autonomous agents to effectively operate in human environments. This task is particularly challenging due to the ubiquitousness of objects and all their nuances in perceptual and semantic detail. In this paper we present an unsupervised approach for learning disentangled representations of objects entirely from unlabeled monocular videos. These continuous representations are not biased by or limited by a discrete set of labels determined by human labelers. The proposed representation is trained with a metric learning loss, where objects with homogeneous features are pushed together, while those with heterogeneous features are pulled apart. We show these unsupervised embeddings allow to discover object attributes and can enable robots to self-supervise in previously unseen environments. We quantitatively evaluate performance on a large-scale synthetic dataset with 12k object models, as well as on a real dataset collected by a robot and show that our unsupervised object understanding generalizes to previously unseen objects. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on robotic manipulation tasks, such as pointing at and grasping of objects. An interesting and perhaps surprising finding in this approach is that given a limited set of objects, object correspondences will naturally emerge when using metric learning without requiring explicit positive pairs.
10	Expanding Non Markovian Reward Decision Processes (NMRDP) into Markov Decision Processes (MDP) enables the use of state of the art Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to identify optimal policies. In this paper an approach to exploring NMRDPs and expanding them into MDPs, without the prior knowledge of the reward structure, is proposed. The non Markovianity of the reward function is disentangled under the assumption that sets of similar and dissimilar trajectory batches can be sampled. More precisely, within the same batch, measuring the similarity between any couple of trajectories is permitted, although comparing trajectories from different batches is not possible. A modified version of the triplet loss is optimised to construct a representation of the trajectories under which rewards become Markovian.
10	This paper studies structured sparse training of CNNs with a gradual pruning technique that leads to fixed, sparse weight matrices after a set number of epochs. We simplify the structure of the enforced sparsity so that it reduces overhead caused by regularization. The proposed training methodology explores several options for structured sparsity.We study various tradeoffs with respect to pruning duration, learning-rate configuration, and the total length of training.We show that our method creates a sparse version of ResNet50 and ResNet50v1.5 on full ImageNet while remaining within a negligible <1% margin of accuracy loss. To make sure that this type of sparse training does not harm the robustness of the network, we also demonstrate how the network behaves in the presence of adversarial attacks.  Our results show that with 70% target sparsity, over 75% top-1 accuracy is achievable. 
01	Learning to align multiple datasets is an important problem with many applications, and it is especially useful when we need to integrate multiple experiments or correct for confounding. Optimal transport (OT) is a principled approach to align  datasets, but a key challenge in applying OT is that we need to specify a cost function that accurately captures how the two datasets are related. Reliable cost functions are typically not available and practitioners often resort to using hand-crafted or Euclidean cost even if it may not be appropriate. In this work, we investigate how to learn the cost function using a small amount of side information which is often available. The side information we consider captures subset correspondence---i.e. certain subsets of points in the two data sets are known to be related. For example, we may have some images labeled as cars in both datasets; or we may have a common annotated cell type in single-cell data from two batches. We develop an end-to-end optimizer (OT-SI) that differentiates through the Sinkhorn algorithm and effectively learns the suitable cost function from side information. On systematic experiments in images, marriage-matching and single-cell RNA-seq, our method substantially outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks. 
01	Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In computer vision, well-crafted perturbations to images can cause neural networks to make mistakes such as confusing a cat with a computer. Previous adversarial attacks have been designed to degrade performance of models or cause machine learning models to produce specific outputs chosen ahead of time by the attacker. We introduce attacks that instead reprogram the target model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without the attacker needing to specify or compute the desired output for each test-time input. This attack finds a single adversarial perturbation, that can be added to all test-time inputs to a machine learning model in order to cause the model to perform a task chosen by the adversary‚Äîeven if the model was not trained to do this task. These perturbations can thus be considered a program for the new task. We demonstrate adversarial reprogramming on six ImageNet classification models, repurposing these models to perform a counting task, as well as classification tasks: classification of MNIST and CIFAR-10 examples presented as inputs to the ImageNet model.
10	Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most powerful sequence models. Despite the strong performance, however, it lacks the nice interpretability as in state space models. In this paper, we present a way to combine the best of both worlds by introducing State Space LSTM (SSL), which generalizes the earlier work \cite{zaheer2017latent} of combining topic models with LSTM. However, unlike \cite{zaheer2017latent}, we do not make any factorization assumptions in our inference algorithm. We present an efficient sampler based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method that draws from the joint posterior directly. Experimental results confirms the superiority and stability of this SMC inference algorithm on a variety of domains.
01	The impressive lifelong learning in animal brains is primarily enabled by plastic changes in synaptic connectivity. Importantly, these changes are not passive, but are actively controlled by neuromodulation, which is itself under the control of the brain. The resulting self-modifying abilities of the brain play an important role in learning and adaptation, and are a major basis for biological reinforcement learning. Here we show for the first time that artificial neural networks with such neuromodulated plasticity can be trained with gradient descent. Extending previous work on differentiable Hebbian plasticity, we propose a differentiable formulation for the neuromodulation of plasticity. We show that neuromodulated plasticity improves the performance of neural networks on both reinforcement learning and supervised learning tasks. In one task, neuromodulated plastic LSTMs with millions of parameters outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task (controlling for the number of parameters). We conclude that differentiable neuromodulation of plasticity offers a powerful new framework for training neural networks.
10	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a very powerful framework for generative modeling. However, they are often hard to train, and learning of GANs often becomes unstable. Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) is a promising framework to deal with the instability problem as it has a good convergence property. One drawback of the WGAN is that it evaluates the Wasserstein distance in the dual domain, which requires some approximation, so that it may fail to optimize the true Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we propose evaluating the exact empirical optimal transport cost efficiently in the primal domain and performing gradient descent with respect to its derivative to train the generator network. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show that our method is significantly stable to converge, and achieves the lowest Wasserstein distance among the WGAN variants at the cost of some sharpness of generated images. Experiments on the 8-Gaussian toy dataset show that better gradients for the generator are obtained in our method. In addition, the proposed method enables more flexible generative modeling than WGAN.
10	"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of deep generative models which aim to learn a target distribution in an unsupervised fashion. While they were successfully applied to many problems, training a GAN is a notoriously challenging task and requires a significant amount of hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture engineering, and a non-trivial amount of ``tricks"". The success in many practical applications coupled with the lack of a measure to quantify the failure modes of GANs resulted in a plethora of proposed losses, regularization and normalization schemes, and neural architectures. In this work we take a sober view of the current state of GANs from a practical perspective. We reproduce the current state of the art and go beyond fairly exploring the GAN landscape. We discuss common pitfalls and reproducibility issues, open-source our code on Github, and provide pre-trained models on TensorFlow Hub."
01	We study the problem of learning to map, in an unsupervised way, between domains $A$ and $B$, such that the samples $\vb \in B$ contain all the information that exists in samples $\va\in A$ and some additional information. For example, ignoring occlusions, $B$ can be people with glasses, $A$ people without, and the glasses, would be the added information. When mapping a sample $\va$ from the first domain to the other domain, the missing information is replicated from an independent reference sample $\vb\in B$. Thus, in the above example, we can create, for every person without glasses a version with the glasses observed in any face image. Our solution employs a single two-pathway encoder and a single decoder for both domains. The common part of the two domains and the separate part are encoded as two vectors, and the separate part is fixed at zero for domain $A$. The loss terms are minimal and involve reconstruction losses for the two domains and a domain confusion term. Our analysis shows that under mild assumptions, this architecture, which is much simpler than the literature guided-translation methods, is enough to ensure disentanglement between the two domains. We present convincing results in a few visual domains, such as no-glasses to glasses, adding facial hair based on a reference image, etc.
10	Many real applications show a great deal of interest in learning multiple tasks from different data sources/modalities with unbalanced samples and dimensions. Unfortunately, existing cutting-edge deep multi-task learning (MTL) approaches cannot be directly applied to these settings, due to either heterogeneous input dimensions or the heterogeneity in the optimal network architectures of different tasks. It is thus demanding to develop knowledge-sharing mechanism to handle the intrinsic discrepancies among network architectures across tasks. To this end, we propose a flexible knowledge-sharing framework for jointly learning multiple tasks from distinct data sources/modalities. The proposed framework allows each task to own its task (data)-specific network design, via utilizing a compact tensor representation, while the sharing is achieved through the partially shared latent cores. By providing more elaborate sharing control with latent cores, our framework is effective in transferring task-invariant knowledge, yet also being efficient in learning task-specific features. Experiments on both single and multiple data sources/modalities settings display the promising results of the proposed method, especially favourable in insufficient data scenarios.
10	In this paper, we present some theoretical work to explain why simple gradient descent methods are so successful in solving non-convex optimization problems in learning large-scale neural networks (NN). After introducing a mathematical tool called  canonical space, we have proved that the objective functions in learning NNs are convex in the canonical model space. We further elucidate that the gradients between the original NN model space and the canonical space are related by a pointwise linear transformation, which is represented by the so-called  disparity matrix. Furthermore, we have proved that gradient descent methods surely converge to a global minimum of zero loss provided that the disparity matrices maintain full rank.  If this full-rank condition holds, the learning of NNs behaves in the same way as normal convex optimization. At last, we have shown that the chance to have singular disparity matrices is extremely slim in large NNs. In particular, when over-parameterized NNs are randomly initialized, the gradient decent algorithms converge to a global minimum of zero loss in probability. 
01	Graph neural networks have recently achieved great successes in predicting quantum mechanical properties of molecules. These models represent a molecule as a graph using only the distance between atoms (nodes). They do not, however, consider the spatial direction from one atom to another, despite directional information playing a central role in empirical potentials for molecules, e.g. in angular potentials. To alleviate this limitation we propose directional message passing, in which we embed the messages passed between atoms instead of the atoms themselves. Each message is associated with a direction in coordinate space. These directional message embeddings are rotationally equivariant since the associated directions rotate with the molecule. We propose a message passing scheme analogous to belief propagation, which uses the directional information by transforming messages based on the angle between them. Additionally, we use spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics to construct theoretically well-founded, orthogonal representations that achieve better performance than the currently prevalent Gaussian radial basis representations while using fewer than 1/4 of the parameters. We leverage these innovations to construct the directional message passing neural network (DimeNet). DimeNet outperforms previous GNNs on average by 76% on MD17 and by 31% on QM9. Our implementation is available online.
10	Serial crystallography is the field of science that studies the structure and properties of crystals via diffraction patterns. In this paper, we introduce a new serial crystallography dataset generated through the use of a simulator; the synthetic images are labeled and they are both scalable and accurate. The resulting synthetic dataset is called DiffraNet, and it is composed of 25,000 512x512 grayscale labeled images. We explore several computer vision approaches for classification on DiffraNet such as standard feature extraction algorithms associated with Random Forests and Support Vector Machines but also an end-to-end CNN topology dubbed DeepFreak tailored to work on this new dataset. All implementations are publicly available and have been fine-tuned using off-the-shelf AutoML optimization tools for a fair comparison. Our best model achieves 98.5% accuracy. We believe that the DiffraNet dataset and its classification methods will have in the long term a positive impact in accelerating discoveries in many disciplines, including chemistry, geology, biology, materials science, metallurgy, and physics.
01	For typical sequence prediction problems such as language generation, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) has commonly been adopted as it encourages the predicted sequence most consistent with the ground-truth sequence to have the highest probability of occurring. However, MLE focuses on once-to-all matching between the predicted sequence and gold-standard, consequently treating all incorrect predictions as being equally incorrect. We refer to this drawback as {\it negative diversity ignorance} in this paper. Treating all incorrect predictions as equal unfairly downplays the nuance of these sequences' detailed token-wise structure. To counteract this, we augment the MLE loss by introducing an extra Kullback--Leibler divergence term derived by comparing a data-dependent Gaussian prior and the detailed training prediction. The proposed data-dependent Gaussian prior objective (D2GPo) is defined over a prior topological order of tokens and is poles apart from the data-independent Gaussian prior (L2 regularization) commonly adopted in smoothing the training of MLE. Experimental results show that the proposed method makes effective use of a more detailed prior in the data and has improved performance in typical language generation tasks, including supervised and unsupervised machine translation, text summarization, storytelling, and image captioning.
10	As the basic building block of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the convolutional layer is designed to extract local patterns and lacks the ability to model global context in its nature. Many efforts have been recently made to complement CNNs with the global modeling ability, especially by a family of works on global feature interaction. In these works, the global context information is incorporated into local features before they are fed into convolutional layers. However, research on neuroscience reveals that, besides influences changing the inputs to our neurons, the neurons' ability of modifying their functions dynamically according to context is essential for perceptual tasks, which has been overlooked in most of CNNs. Motivated by this, we propose one novel Context-Gated Convolution (CGC) to explicitly modify the weights of convolutional layers adaptively under the guidance of global context. As such, being aware of the global context, the modulated convolution kernel of our proposed CGC can better extract representative local patterns and compose discriminative features. Moreover, our proposed CGC is lightweight, amenable to modern CNN architectures, and consistently improves the performance of CNNs according to extensive experiments on image classification, action recognition, and machine translation. 
10	We introduce an new technique to learn correlations between two types of data.The learned representation can be used to directly compute the expectations of functions over one type of data conditioned on the other, such as Bayesian estimators and their standard deviations. Specifically, our loss function teaches two neural nets to extract features representing the probability vectors of highest singular value for the stochastic map (set of conditional probabilities) implied by the joint dataset, relative to the inner product defined by the Fisher information metrics evaluated at the marginals.We test the approach using a synthetic dataset, analytical calculations, and inference on occluded MNIST images. Surprisingly, when applied to supervised learning (one dataset consists of labels), this approach automatically provides regularization and faster convergence compared to the cross-entropy objective.We also explore using this approach to discover salient independent features of a single dataset. 
01	This paper investigates a population-based training regime based on game-theoretic principles called Policy-Spaced Response Oracles (PSRO). PSRO is general in the sense that it (1) encompasses well-known algorithms such as fictitious play and double oracle as special cases, and (2) in principle applies to general-sum, many-player games. Despite this, prior studies of PSRO have been focused on two-player zero-sum games, a regime where in Nash equilibria are tractably computable. In moving from two-player zero-sum games to more general settings, computation of Nash equilibria quickly becomes infeasible.  Here, we extend the theoretical underpinnings of PSRO by considering an alternative solution concept, Œ±-Rank, which is unique (thus faces no equilibrium selection issues, unlike Nash) and applies readily to general-sum, many-player settings. We establish convergence guarantees in several games classes, and identify links between Nash equilibria and Œ±-Rank. We demonstrate the competitive performance of Œ±-Rank-based PSRO against an exact Nash solver-based PSRO in 2-player Kuhn and Leduc Poker. We then go beyond the reach of prior PSRO applications by considering 3- to 5-player poker games, yielding instances where Œ±-Rank achieves faster convergence than approximate Nash solvers, thus establishing it as a favorable general games solver. We also carry out an initial empirical validation in MuJoCo soccer, illustrating the feasibility of the proposed approach in another complex domain.
10	Classifiers such as deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial perturbations on problems with high-dimensional input space. While adversarial training improves the robustness of classifiers against such adversarial perturbations, it leaves classifiers sensitive to them on a non-negligible fraction of the inputs. We argue that there are two different kinds of adversarial perturbations: shared perturbations which fool a classifier on many inputs and singular perturbations which only fool the classifier on a small fraction of the data. We find that adversarial training increases the robustness of classifiers against shared perturbations. Moreover, it is particularly effective in removing universal perturbations, which can be seen as an extreme form of shared perturbations. Unfortunately, adversarial training does not consistently increase the robustness against singular perturbations on unseen inputs. However, we find that adversarial training decreases robustness of the remaining perturbations against image transformations such as changes to contrast and brightness or  Gaussian blurring. It thus makes successful attacks on the classifier in the physical world less likely. Finally, we show that even singular perturbations can be easily detected and must thus exhibit generalizable patterns even though the perturbations are specific for certain inputs. 
01	Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn effective policies for complex tasks, such as Atari games, even from image observations. However, this typically requires very large amounts of interaction -- substantially more, in fact, than a human would need to learn the same games. How can people learn so quickly? Part of the answer may be that people can learn how the game works and predict which actions will lead to desirable outcomes. In this paper, we explore how video prediction models can similarly enable agents to solve Atari games with fewer interactions than model-free methods. We describe Simulated Policy Learning (SimPLe), a complete model-based deep RL algorithm based on video prediction models and present a comparison of several model architectures, including a novel architecture that yields the best results in our setting. Our experiments evaluate SimPLe on a range of Atari games in low data regime of 100k interactions between the agent and the environment, which corresponds to two hours of real-time play. In most games SimPLe outperforms state-of-the-art model-free algorithms, in some games by over an order of magnitude.
01	Despite existing work on ensuring generalization of neural networks in terms of scale sensitive complexity measures, such as norms, margin and sharpness, these complexity measures do not offer an explanation of why neural networks generalize better with over-parametrization. In this work we suggest a novel complexity measure based on unit-wise capacities resulting in a tighter generalization bound for two layer ReLU networks. Our capacity bound correlates with the behavior of test error with increasing network sizes (within the range reported in the experiments), and could partly explain the improvement in generalization with over-parametrization. We further present a matching lower bound for the Rademacher complexity that improves over previous capacity lower bounds for neural networks. 
10	 Auto-encoding and generative models have made tremendous successes in image and signal representation learning and generation. These models, however, generally employ the full Euclidean space or a bounded subset (such as $[0,1]^l$) as the latent space, whose trivial geometry is often too simplistic to meaningfully reflect the structure of the data. This paper aims at exploring a nontrivial geometric structure of the latent space for better data representation. Inspired by differential geometry, we propose \textbf{Chart Auto-Encoder (CAE)}, which captures the manifold structure of the data with multiple charts and transition functions among them. CAE translates the mathematical definition of manifold through parameterizing the entire data set as a collection of overlapping charts, creating local latent representations. These representations are an enhancement of the single-charted latent space commonly employed in auto-encoding models, as they reflect the intrinsic structure of the manifold.  Therefore, CAE achieves a more accurate approximation of data and generates realistic new ones. We conduct experiments with synthetic and real-life data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CAE. 
10	We study the joint distribution matching problem which aims at learning bidirectional mappings to match the joint distribution of two domains. This problem occurs in unsupervised image-to-image translation and video-to-video synthesis tasks, which, however, has two critical challenges: (i) it is difficult to exploit sufficient information from the joint distribution; (ii) how to theoretically and experimentally evaluate the generalization performance remains an open question. To address the above challenges, we propose a new optimization problem and design a novel Joint Wasserstein Auto-Encoders (JWAE) to minimize the Wasserstein distance of the joint distributions in two domains. We theoretically prove that the generalization ability of the proposed method can be guaranteed by minimizing the Wasserstein distance of joint distributions. To verify the generalization ability, we apply our method to unsupervised video-to-video synthesis by performing video frame interpolation and producing visually smooth videos in two domains, simultaneously. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our method over several state-of-the-arts.
10	 Deep neural networks are used in many state-of-the-art systems for machine perception. Once a network is trained to do a specific task, it cannot be easily trained to do new tasks as it leads to catastrophic forgetting of the previously learned tasks. We propose here a novel architecture called EnsembleNet that accommodates for newer classes of data without having to retrain previously trained sub-models. The novelty of our model lies in the fact that only a small portion of the network has to be retrained which makes it extremely computational efficient and also results in high performance compared to other architectures in the literature. We demonstrated our model on MNIST Handwritten digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR10 datasets. The proposed architecture was benchmarked against other models in the literature on Omega-new, Omega-base, Omega-all metrics for MNIST- Handwritten dataset. The experimental results show that Ensemble Net on overall outperformed every other model in the literature.
01	Decentralized training of deep learning models is a key element for enabling data privacy and on-device learning over networks, as well as for efficient scaling to large compute clusters. As current approaches are limited by network bandwidth, we propose the use of communication compression in the decentralized training context. We show that Choco-SGD achieves linear speedup in the number of workers for arbitrary high compression ratios on general non-convex functions, and non-IID training data.  We demonstrate the practical performance of the algorithm in two key scenarios: the training of deep learning models (i) over decentralized user devices, connected by a peer-to-peer network and (ii) in a datacenter. 
01	Efficient audio synthesis is an inherently difficult machine learning task, as human perception is sensitive to both global structure and fine-scale waveform coherence. Autoregressive models, such as WaveNet, model local structure at the expense of global latent structure and slow iterative sampling, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have global latent conditioning and efficient parallel sampling, but struggle to generate locally-coherent audio waveforms. Herein, we demonstrate that GANs can in fact generate high-fidelity and locally-coherent audio by modeling log magnitudes and instantaneous frequencies  with sufficient frequency resolution in the spectral domain. Through extensive empirical investigations on the NSynth dataset, we demonstrate that GANs are able to outperform strong WaveNet baselines on automated and human evaluation metrics, and efficiently generate audio several orders of magnitude faster than their autoregressive counterparts.
01	We provide a theoretical algorithm for checking local optimality and escaping saddles at nondifferentiable points of empirical risks of two-layer ReLU networks. Our algorithm receives any parameter value and returns: local minimum, second-order stationary point, or a strict descent direction. The presence of M data points on the nondifferentiability of the ReLU divides the parameter space into at most 2^M regions, which makes analysis difficult. By exploiting polyhedral geometry, we reduce the total computation down to one convex quadratic program (QP) for each hidden node, O(M) (in)equality tests, and one (or a few) nonconvex QP. For the last QP, we show that our specific problem can be solved efficiently, in spite of nonconvexity. In the benign case, we solve one equality constrained QP, and we prove that projected gradient descent solves it exponentially fast. In the bad case, we have to solve a few more inequality constrained QPs, but we prove that the time complexity is exponential only in the number of inequality constraints. Our experiments show that either benign case or bad case with very few inequality constraints occurs, implying that our algorithm is efficient in most cases.
10	The exposure bias problem refers to the training-inference discrepancy caused by teacher forcing in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) training for auto-regressive neural network language models (LM). It has been regarded as a central problem for natural language generation (NLG) model training. Although a lot of algorithms have been proposed to avoid teacher forcing and therefore to alleviate exposure bias, there is little work showing how serious the exposure bias problem is. In this work, we first identify the auto-recovery ability of MLE-trained LM, which casts doubt on the seriousness of exposure bias. We then develop a precise, quantifiable definition for exposure bias. However, according to our measurements in controlled experiments, there's only around 3% performance gain when the training-inference discrepancy is completely removed. Our results suggest the exposure bias problem could be much less serious than it is currently assumed to be.
10	Few-shot learning aims to handle previously unseen tasks using only a small amount of new training data. In preparing (or meta-training) a few-shot learner, however, massive labeled data are necessary. In the real world, unfortunately, labeled data are expensive and/or scarce. In this work, we propose a few-shot learner that can work well under the semi-supervised setting where a large portion of training data is unlabeled. Our method employs explicit task-conditioning in which unlabeled sample clustering for the current task takes place in a new projection space different from the embedding feature space. The conditioned clustering space is linearly constructed so as to quickly close the gap between the class centroids for the current task and the independent per-class reference vectors meta-trained across tasks. In a more general setting, our method introduces a concept of controlling the degree of task-conditioning for meta-learning: the amount of task-conditioning varies with the number of repetitive updates for the clustering space. During each update, the soft labels of the unlabeled samples estimated in the conditioned clustering space are used to update the class averages in the original embedded space, which in turn are used to reconstruct the clustering space. Extensive simulation results based on the miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets show state-of-the-art semi-supervised few-shot classification performance of the proposed method. Simulation results also indicate that the proposed task-adaptive clustering shows graceful degradation with a growing number of distractor samples, i.e., unlabeled samples coming from outside the candidate classes.
10	Profiling cellular phenotypes from microscopic imaging can provide meaningful biological information resulting from various factors affecting the cells. One motivating application is drug development: morphological cell features can be captured from images, from which similarities between different drugs applied at different dosages can be quantified. The general approach is to find a function mapping the images to an embedding space of manageable dimensionality whose geometry captures relevant features of the input images. An important known issue for such methods is separating relevant biological signal from nuisance variation. For example, the embedding vectors tend to be more correlated for cells that were cultured and imaged during the same week than for cells from a different week, despite having identical drug compounds applied in both cases. In this case, the particular batch a set of experiments were conducted in constitutes the domain of the data; an ideal set of image embeddings should contain only the relevant biological information (e.g. drug effects). We develop a general framework for adjusting the image embeddings in order to `forget' domain-specific information while preserving relevant biological information. To do this, we minimize a loss function based on distances between marginal distributions (such as the Wasserstein distance) of embeddings across domains for each replicated treatment. For the dataset presented, the replicated treatment is the negative control. We find that for our transformed embeddings (1) the underlying geometric structure is not only preserved but the embeddings also carry improved biological signal (2) less domain-specific information is present.
10	Existing local explanation methods provide an explanation for each decision of black-box classifiers, in the form of relevance scores of features according to their contributions. To obtain satisfying explainability, many methods introduce ad hoc constraints into the classification loss to regularize these relevance scores. However, the large information gap between the classification loss and these constraints increases the difficulty of tuning hyper-parameters. To bridge this gap, in this paper we present a simple but effective mask predictor. Specifically, we model the above constraints with a distribution controller, and integrate it with a neural network to directly guide the distribution of relevance scores. The benefit of this strategy is to facilitate the setting of involved hyper-parameters, and enable discriminative scores over supporting features. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms others in terms of faithfulness and explainability. Meanwhile, it also provides effective saliency maps for explaining each decision. 
01	One of the big challenges in machine learning applications is that training data can be different from the real-world data faced by the algorithm. In language modeling, users‚Äô language (e.g. in private messaging) could change in a year and be completely different from what we observe in publicly available data. At the same time, public data can be used for obtaining general knowledge (i.e. general model of English). We study approaches to distributed fine-tuning of a general model on user private data with the additional requirements of maintaining the quality on the general data and minimization of communication costs. We propose a novel technique that significantly improves prediction quality on users‚Äô language compared to a general model and outperforms gradient compression methods in terms of communication efficiency. The proposed procedure is fast and leads to an almost 70% perplexity reduction and 8.7 percentage point improvement in keystroke saving rate on informal English texts. Finally, we propose an experimental framework for evaluating differential privacy of distributed training of language models and show that our approach has good privacy guarantees.
10	Implicit generative models are difficult to train as no explicit probability density functions are defined. Generative adversarial nets (GANs) propose a minimax framework to train such models, which suffer from mode collapse in practice due to the nature of the JS-divergence. In contrast, we propose a learning by teaching (LBT) framework to learn implicit models, which intrinsically avoid the  mode collapse problem because of using the KL-divergence. In LBT, an auxiliary explicit model is introduced to learn the distribution defined by the implicit model while the later one's goal is to teach the explicit model to match the data distribution. LBT is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, whose optimum implies that we obtain the maximum likelihood estimation of the implicit model. We adopt an unrolling approach to solve the challenging learning problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
01	We show state-of-the-art word representation learning methods maximize an objective function that is a lower bound on the mutual information between different parts of a word sequence (i.e., a sentence). Our formulation provides an alternative perspective that unifies classical word embedding models (e.g., Skip-gram) and modern contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, XLNet). In addition to enhancing our theoretical understanding of these methods, our derivation leads to a principled framework that can be used to construct new self-supervised tasks. We provide an example by drawing inspirations from related methods based on mutual information maximization that have been successful in computer vision, and introduce a simple self-supervised objective that maximizes the mutual information between a global sentence representation and n-grams in the sentence. Our analysis offers a holistic view of representation learning methods to transfer knowledge and translate progress across multiple domains (e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, audio processing).
01	We study the behavior of weight-tied multilayer vanilla autoencoders under the assumption of random weights. Via an exact characterization in the limit of large dimensions, our analysis reveals interesting phase transition phenomena when the depth becomes large. This, in particular, provides quantitative answers and insights to three questions that were yet fully understood in the literature. Firstly, we provide a precise answer on how the random deep weight-tied autoencoder model performs ‚Äúapproximate inference‚Äù as posed by Scellier et al. (2018), and its connection to reversibility considered by several theoretical studies. Secondly, we show that deep autoencoders display a higher degree of sensitivity to perturbations in the parameters, distinct from the shallow counterparts. Thirdly, we obtain insights on pitfalls in training initialization practice, and demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to train a deep autoencoder, even with the tanh activation and a depth as large as 200 layers, without resorting to techniques such as layer-wise pre-training or batch normalization. Our analysis is not specific to any depths or any Lipschitz activations, and our analytical techniques may have broader applicability.
01	The driving force behind deep networks is their ability to compactly represent rich classes of functions. The primary notion for formally reasoning about this phenomenon is expressive efficiency, which refers to a situation where one network must grow unfeasibly large in order to replicate functions of another. To date, expressive efficiency analyses focused on the architectural feature of depth, showing that deep networks are representationally superior to shallow ones. In this paper we study the expressive efficiency brought forth by connectivity, motivated by the observation that modern networks interconnect their layers in elaborate ways. We focus on dilated convolutional networks, a family of deep models delivering state of the art performance in sequence processing tasks. By introducing and analyzing the concept of mixed tensor decompositions, we prove that interconnecting dilated convolutional networks can lead to expressive efficiency. In particular, we show that even a single connection between intermediate layers can already lead to an almost quadratic gap, which in large-scale settings typically makes the difference between a model that is practical and one that is not. Empirical evaluation demonstrates how the expressive efficiency of connectivity, similarly to that of depth, translates into gains in accuracy. This leads us to believe that expressive efficiency may serve a key role in developing new tools for deep network design.
01	To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.
01	We address the following question: How redundant is the parameterisation of ReLU networks? Specifically, we consider transformations of the weight space which leave the function implemented by the network intact. Two such transformations are known for feed-forward architectures: permutation of neurons within a layer, and positive scaling of all incoming weights of a neuron coupled with inverse scaling of its outgoing weights. In this work, we show for architectures with non-increasing widths that permutation and scaling are in fact the only function-preserving weight transformations. For any eligible architecture we give an explicit construction of a neural network such that any other network that implements the same function can be obtained from the original one by the application of permutations and rescaling. The proof relies on a geometric understanding of boundaries between linear regions of ReLU networks, and we hope the developed mathematical tools are of independent interest.
10	Batch Normalization (BN) and its variants have seen widespread adoption in the deep learning community because they improve the training of deep neural networks. Discussions of why this normalization works so well remain unsettled.  We make explicit the relationship between ordinary least squares and partial derivatives computed when back-propagating through BN. We recast the back-propagation of BN as a least squares fit, which zero-centers and decorrelates partial derivatives from normalized activations. This view, which we term {\em gradient-least-squares}, is an extensible and arithmetically accurate description of BN. To further explore this perspective, we motivate, interpret, and evaluate two adjustments to BN.
10	We study how to set the number of channels in a neural network to achieve better accuracy under constrained resources (e.g., FLOPs, latency, memory footprint or model size). A simple and one-shot approach, named AutoSlim, is presented. Instead of training many network samples and searching with reinforcement learning, we train a single slimmable network to approximate the network accuracy of different channel configurations. We then iteratively evaluate the trained slimmable model and greedily slim the layer with minimal accuracy drop. By this single pass, we can obtain the optimized channel configurations under different resource constraints. We present experiments with MobileNet v1, MobileNet v2, ResNet-50 and RL-searched MNasNet on ImageNet classification. We show significant improvements over their default channel configurations. We also achieve better accuracy than recent channel pruning methods and neural architecture search methods with 100X lower search cost.Notably, by setting optimized channel numbers, our AutoSlim-MobileNet-v2 at 305M FLOPs achieves 74.2% top-1 accuracy, 2.4% better than default MobileNet-v2 (301M FLOPs), and even 0.2% better than RL-searched MNasNet (317M FLOPs). Our AutoSlim-ResNet-50 at 570M FLOPs, without depthwise convolutions, achieves 1.3% better accuracy than MobileNet-v1 (569M FLOPs).
01	Sorting input objects is an important step in many machine learning pipelines. However, the sorting operator is non-differentiable with respect to its inputs, which prohibits end-to-end gradient-based optimization. In this work, we propose NeuralSort, a general-purpose continuous relaxation of the output of the sorting operator from permutation matrices to the set of unimodal row-stochastic matrices, where every row sums to one and has a distinct argmax. This relaxation permits straight-through optimization of any computational graph involve a sorting operation. Further, we use this relaxation to enable gradient-based stochastic optimization over the combinatorially large space of permutations by deriving a reparameterized gradient estimator for the Plackett-Luce family of distributions over permutations. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework on three tasks that require learning semantic orderings of high-dimensional objects, including a fully differentiable, parameterized extension of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm
10	We present a Homotopy Training Algorithm (HTA) to solve optimization problems arising from neural networks. The HTA starts with several decoupled systems with low dimensional structure and tracks the solution to the high dimensional coupled system. The decoupled systems are easy to solve due to the low dimensionality but can be connected to the original system via a continuous homotopy path guided by the HTA. We have proved the convergence of HTA for the non-convex case and existence of the homotopy solution path for the convex case. The HTA has provided a better accuracy on several examples including VGG models on CIFAR-10. Moreover, the HTA would be combined with the dropout technique to provide an alternative way to train the neural networks.
10	Imitation learning is an effective alternative approach to learn a policy when the reward function is sparse. In this paper, we consider a challenging setting where an agent has access to a sparse reward function and state-only expert observations. We propose a method which gradually balances between the imitation learning cost and the reinforcement learning objective. Built upon an existing imitation learning method, our approach works with state-only observations. We show, through navigation scenarios, that (i) an agent is able to efficiently leverage sparse rewards to outperform standard state-only imitation learning, (ii) it can learn a policy even when learner's actions are different from the expert, and (iii) the performance of the agent is not bounded by that of the expert due to the optimized usage of sparse rewards.
10	Understanding physical phenomena is a key component of human intelligence and enables physical interaction with previously unseen environments. In this paper, we study how an artificial agent can autonomously acquire this intuition through interaction with the environment. We created a synthetic block stacking environment with physics simulation in which the agent can learn a policy end-to-end through trial and error. Thereby, we bypass to explicitly model physical knowledge within the policy. We are specifically interested in tasks that require the agent to reach a given goal state that may be different for every new trial. To this end, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that learns policies which are parametrized by a goal. We validated the model on a toy example navigating in a grid world with different target positions and in a block stacking task with different target structures of the final tower. In contrast to prior work, our policies show better generalization across different goals.
01	A central challenge in reinforcement learning is discovering effective policies for tasks where rewards are sparsely distributed. We postulate that in the absence of useful reward signals, an effective exploration strategy should seek out {\it decision states}. These states lie at critical junctions in the state space from where the agent can transition to new, potentially unexplored regions. We propose to learn about decision states from prior experience. By training a goal-conditioned model with an information bottleneck, we can identify decision states by examining where the model accesses the goal state through the bottleneck. We find that this simple mechanism effectively identifies decision states, even in partially observed settings. In effect, the model learns the sensory cues that correlate with potential subgoals. In new environments, this model can then identify novel subgoals for further exploration, guiding the agent through a sequence of potential decision  states and through new regions of the state space.
10	Exploration in environments with sparse rewards is a key challenge for reinforcement learning. How do we design agents with generic inductive biases so that they can explore in a consistent manner instead of just using local exploration schemes like epsilon-greedy? We propose an unsupervised reinforcement learning agent which learns a discrete pixel grouping model that preserves spatial geometry of the sensors and implicitly of the environment as well. We use this representation to derive geometric intrinsic reward functions, like centroid coordinates and area, and learn policies to control each one of them with off-policy learning. These policies form a basis set of behaviors (options) which allows us explore in a consistent way and use them in a hierarchical reinforcement learning setup to solve for extrinsically defined rewards. We show that our approach can scale to a variety of domains with competitive performance, including navigation in 3D environments and Atari games with sparse rewards.
10	This paper puts forward a new text to tensor representation that relies on information compression techniques to assign shorter codes to the most frequently used characters. This representation is language-independent with no need of pretraining and produces an encoding with no information loss. It provides an adequate description of the morphology of text, as it is able to represent prefixes, declensions, and inflections with similar vectors and are able to represent even unseen words on the training dataset. Similarly, as it is compact yet sparse, is ideal for speed up training times using tensor processing libraries. As part of this paper, we show that this technique is especially effective when coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for text classification at character-level. We apply two variants of CNN coupled with it. Experimental results show that it drastically reduces the number of parameters to be optimized, resulting in competitive classification accuracy values in only a fraction of the time spent by one-hot encoding representations, thus enabling training in commodity hardware.
10	Image generation has been successfully cast as an autoregressive sequence generationor transformation problem. Recent work has shown that self-attention isan effective way of modeling textual sequences. In this work, we generalize arecently proposed model architecture based on self-attention, the Transformer, toa sequence modeling formulation of image generation with a tractable likelihood.By restricting the self-attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods wesignificantly increase the size of images the model can process in practice, despitemaintaining significantly larger receptive fields per layer than typical convolutionalneural networks. We propose another extension of self-attention allowing itto efficiently take advantage of the two-dimensional nature of images.While conceptually simple, our generative models trained on two image data setsare competitive with or significantly outperform the current state of the art in autoregressiveimage generation on two different data sets, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.We also present results on image super-resolution with a large magnification ratio,applying an encoder-decoder configuration of our architecture. In a humanevaluation study, we show that our super-resolution models improve significantlyover previously published autoregressive super-resolution models. Images theygenerate fool human observers three times more often than the previous state ofthe art.
01	Most generative models of audio directly generate samples in one of two domains: time or frequency. While sufficient to express any signal, these representations are inefficient, as they do not utilize existing knowledge of how sound is generated and perceived. A third approach (vocoders/synthesizers) successfully incorporates strong domain knowledge of signal processing and perception, but has been less actively researched due to limited expressivity and difficulty integrating with modern auto-differentiation-based machine learning methods. In this paper, we introduce the Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) library, which enables direct integration of classic signal processing elements with deep learning methods. Focusing on audio synthesis, we achieve high-fidelity generation without the need for large autoregressive models or adversarial losses, demonstrating that DDSP enables utilizing strong inductive biases without losing the expressive power of neural networks. Further, we show that combining interpretable modules permits manipulation of each separate model component, with applications such as independent control of pitch and loudness, realistic extrapolation to pitches not seen during training, blind dereverberation of room acoustics, transfer of extracted room acoustics to new environments, and transformation of timbre between disparate sources. In short, DDSP enables an interpretable and modular approach to generative modeling, without sacrificing the benefits of deep learning. The library will is available at https://github.com/magenta/ddsp and we encourage further contributions from the community and domain experts.
10	In the twilight of Moore's law, GPUs and other specialized hardware accelerators have dramatically sped up neural network training. However, earlier stages of the training pipeline, such as disk I/O and data preprocessing, do not run on accelerators. As accelerators continue to improve, these earlier stages will increasingly become the bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce ‚Äúdata echoing,‚Äù which reduces the total computation used by earlier pipeline stages and speeds up training whenever computation upstream from accelerators dominates the training time. Data echoing reuses (or ‚Äúechoes‚Äù) intermediate outputs from earlier pipeline stages in order to reclaim idle capacity. We investigate the behavior of different data echoing algorithms on various workloads, for various amounts of echoing, and for various batch sizes. We find that in all settings, at least one data echoing algorithm can match the baseline's predictive performance using less upstream computation. We measured a factor of 3.25 decrease in wall-clock time for ResNet-50 on ImageNet when reading training data over a network.
10	Inspired by the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in image domains, we introduce a novel hierarchical architecture for learning characteristic topological features from a single arbitrary input graph via GANs. The hierarchical architecture consisting of multiple GANs preserves both local and global topological features, and automatically partitions the input graph into representative stages for feature learning. The stages facilitate reconstruction and can be used as indicators of the importance of the associated topological structures. Experiments show that our method produces subgraphs retaining a wide range of topological features, even in early reconstruction stages. This paper contains original research on combining the use of GANs and graph topological analysis.
01	The driving force behind the recent success of LSTMs has been their ability to learn complex and non-linear relationships. Consequently, our inability to describe these relationships has led to LSTMs being characterized as black boxes. To this end, we introduce contextual decomposition (CD), an interpretation algorithm for analysing individual predictions made by standard LSTMs, without any changes to the underlying model. By decomposing the output of a LSTM, CD captures the contributions of combinations of words or variables to the final prediction of an LSTM. On the task of sentiment analysis with the Yelp and SST data sets, we show that CD is able to reliably identify words and phrases of contrasting sentiment, and how they are combined to yield the LSTM's final prediction. Using the phrase-level labels in SST, we also demonstrate that CD is able to successfully extract positive and negative negations from an LSTM, something which has not previously been done.
10	Meta-learning algorithms learn to acquire new tasks more quickly from past experience. In the context of reinforcement learning, meta-learning algorithms can acquire reinforcement learning procedures to solve new problems more efficiently by utilizing experience from prior tasks. The performance of meta-learning algorithms depends on the tasks available for meta-training: in the same way that supervised learning generalizes best to test points drawn from the same distribution as the training points, meta-learning methods generalize best to tasks from the same distribution as the meta-training tasks. In effect, meta-reinforcement learning offloads the design burden from algorithm design to task design. If we can automate the process of task design as well, we can devise a meta-learning algorithm that is truly automated. In this work, we take a step in this direction, proposing a family of unsupervised meta-learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. We motivate and describe a general recipe for unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning, and present an instantiation of this approach. Our conceptual and theoretical contributions consist of formulating the unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning problem and describing how task proposals based on mutual information can in principle be used to train optimal meta-learners. Our experimental results indicate that unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning effectively acquires accelerated reinforcement learning procedures without the need for manual task design and significantly exceeds the performance of learning from scratch.
10	We consider the task of few shot link prediction, where the goal is to predict missing edges across multiple graphs using only a small sample of known edges. We show that current link prediction methods are generally ill-equipped to handle this task---as they cannot effectively transfer knowledge between graphs in a multi-graph setting and are unable to effectively learn from very sparse data. To address this challenge, we introduce a new gradient-based meta learning framework, Meta-Graph, that leverages higher-order gradients along with a learned graph signature function that conditionally generates a graph neural network initialization. Using a novel set of few shot link prediction benchmarks, we show that Meta-Graph enables not only fast adaptation but also better final convergence and can effectively learn using only a small sample of true edges.
10	Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are capable of producing high quality samples, but they suffer from numerous issues such as instability and mode collapse during training. To combat this, we propose to model the generator and discriminator as agents acting under local information, uncertainty, and awareness of their opponent. By doing so we achieve stable convergence, even when the underlying game has no  Nash equilibria. We call this mechanism \emph{implicit competitive regularization} (ICR) and show that it is present in the recently proposed \emph{competitive gradient descent} (CGD).When comparing CGD to Adam using a variety of loss functions and regularizers on CIFAR10, CGD shows a much more consistent performance, which we attribute to ICR.In our experiments, we achieve the highest inception score when using the WGAN loss (without gradient penalty or weight clipping) together with CGD. This can be interpreted as minimizing a form of integral probability metric based on ICR.
01	We make the following striking observation: fully convolutional VAE models trained on 32x32 ImageNet can generalize well, not just to 64x64 but also to far larger photographs, with no changes to the model. We use this property, applying fully convolutional models to lossless compression, demonstrating a method to scale the VAE-based 'Bits-Back with ANS' algorithm for lossless compression to large color photographs, and achieving state of the art for compression of full size ImageNet images. We release Craystack, an open source library for convenient prototyping of lossless compression using probabilistic models, along with full implementations of all of our compression results.
10	This paper proposes Metagross (Meta Gated Recursive Controller), a new neural sequence modeling unit. Our proposed unit is characterized by recursive parameterization of its gating functions, i.e., gating mechanisms of Metagross are controlled by instances of itself, which are repeatedly called in a recursive fashion. This can be interpreted as a form of meta-gating and recursively parameterizing a recurrent model. We postulate that our proposed inductive bias provides modeling benefits pertaining to learning with inherently hierarchically-structured sequence data (e.g., language, logical or music tasks). To this end, we conduct extensive experiments on recursive logic tasks (sorting, tree traversal, logical inference), sequential pixel-by-pixel classification, semantic parsing, code generation, machine translation and polyphonic music modeling, demonstrating the widespread utility of the proposed approach, i.e., achieving state-of-the-art (or close) performance on all tasks.
10	Adversarial examples, referred to as augmented data points generated by imperceptible perturbation of input samples, have recently drawn much attention. Well-crafted adversarial examples may even mislead state-of-the-art deep models to make wrong predictions easily. To alleviate this problem, many studies focus on investigating how adversarial examples can be generated and/or resisted. All the existing work handles this problem in the Euclidean space, which may however be unable to describe data geometry. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework that addresses the learning problem of adversarial examples with Riemannian geometry. Specifically, we define the local coordinate systems on Riemannian manifold, develop a novel model called Adversarial Training with Riemannian Manifold, and design a series of theory that manages to learn the adversarial examples in the Riemannian space feasibly and efficiently. The proposed work is important in that (1) it is a generalized learning methodology since Riemmanian manifold space would be degraded to the Euclidean space in a special case; (2) it is the first work to tackle the adversarial example problem tractably through the perspective of geometry; (3) from the perspective of geometry, our method leads to the steepest direction of the loss function. We also provide a series of theory showing that our proposed method can truly find the decent direction for the loss function with a comparable computational time against traditional adversarial methods. Finally, the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance to the traditional counterpart methods on benchmark data including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.
01	We propose a meta-learning approach that learns from multiple tasks in a transductive setting, by leveraging the unlabeled query set in addition to the  support set to generate a more powerful model for each task. To develop our framework, we revisit the empirical Bayes formulation for multi-task learning.   The evidence lower bound of the marginal log-likelihood of empirical Bayes decomposes as a sum of local KL divergences between the variational posterior and the true posterior on the query set of each task.We derive a novel amortized variational inference that couples all the variational posteriors via a meta-model, which consists of a synthetic gradient   network and an initialization network. Each variational posterior is derived from synthetic gradient descent to approximate the true posterior on the query  set, although where we do not have access to the true gradient.Our results on the Mini-ImageNet and CIFAR-FS benchmarks for episodic few-shot classification outperform previous state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we conduct two zero-shot learning experiments to further explore the potential of the synthetic gradient.
10	Recent research about margin theory has proved that maximizing the minimum margin like support vector machines does not necessarily lead to better performance, and instead, it is crucial to optimize the margin distribution. In the meantime, margin theory has been used to explain the empirical success of deep network in recent studies. In this paper, we present ODN (the Optimal margin Distribution Network), a network which embeds a loss function in regard to the optimal margin distribution. We give a theoretical analysis for our method using the PAC-Bayesian framework, which confirms the significance of the margin distribution for classification within the framework of deep networks. In addition, empirical results show that the ODN model always outperforms the baseline cross-entropy loss model consistently across different regularization situations. And our ODNmodel also outperforms the cross-entropy loss (Xent), hinge loss and soft hinge loss model in generalization task through limited training data.
10	Massive data exist among user local platforms that usually cannot support deep neural network (DNN) training due to computation and storage resource constraints. Cloud-based training schemes provide beneficial services but suffer from potential privacy risks due to excessive user data collection. To enable cloud-based DNN training while protecting the data privacy simultaneously, we propose to leverage the intermediate representations of the data, which is achieved by splitting the DNNs and deploying them separately onto local platforms and the cloud. The local neural network (NN) is used to generate the feature representations. To avoid local training and protect data privacy, the local NN is derived from pre-trained NNs. The cloud NN is then trained based on the extracted intermediate representations for the target learning task. We validate the idea of DNN splitting by characterizing the dependency of privacy loss and classification accuracy on the local NN topology for a convolutional NN (CNN) based image classification task. Based on the characterization, we further propose PrivyNet to determine the local NN topology, which optimizes the accuracy of the target learning task under the constraints on privacy loss, local computation, and storage. The efficiency and effectiveness of PrivyNet are demonstrated with CIFAR-10 dataset.
10	Most deep neural networks (DNNs) require complex models to achieve high performance. Parameter quantization is widely used for reducing the implementation complexities. Previous studies on quantization were mostly based on extensive simulation using training data. We choose a different approach and attempt to measure the per-parameter capacity of DNN models and interpret the results to obtain insights on optimum quantization of parameters. This research uses artificially generated data and generic forms of fully connected DNNs, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. We conduct memorization and classification tests to study the effects of the number and precision of the parameters on the performance. The model and the per-parameter capacities are assessed by measuring the mutual information between the input and the classified output. We also extend the memorization capacity measurement results to image classification and language modeling tasks. To get insight for parameter quantization when performing real tasks, the training and test performances are compared.
01	"We consider two questions at the heart of machine learning; how can we predict if a minimum will generalize to the test set, and why does stochastic gradient descent find minima that generalize well? Our work responds to \citet{zhang2016understanding}, who showed deep neural networks can easily memorize randomly labeled training data, despite generalizing well on real labels of the same inputs. We show that the same phenomenon occurs in small linear models. These observations are explained by the Bayesian evidence, which penalizes sharp minima but is invariant to model parameterization. We also demonstrate that, when one holds the learning rate fixed, there is an optimum batch size which maximizes the test set accuracy. We propose that the noise introduced by small mini-batches drives the parameters towards minima whose evidence is large. Interpreting stochastic gradient descent as a stochastic differential equation, we identify the ``noise scale"" $g = \epsilon (\frac{N}{B} - 1) \approx \epsilon N/B$, where $\epsilon$ is the learning rate, $N$ the training set size and $B$ the batch size. Consequently the optimum batch size is proportional to both the learning rate and the size of the training set, $B_{opt} \propto \epsilon N$. We verify these predictions empirically."
10	In many applications we seek to optimize an expectation with respect to a distribution over discrete variables. Estimating gradients of such objectives with respect to the distribution parameters is a challenging problem. We analyze existing solutions including finite-difference (FD) estimators and continuous relaxation (CR) estimators in terms of bias and variance. We show that the commonly used Gumbel-Softmax estimator is biased and propose a simple method to reduce it. We also derive a simpler piece-wise linear continuous relaxation that also possesses reduced bias. We demonstrate empirically that reduced bias leads to a better performance in variational inference and on binary optimization tasks.
10	We first show that the commonly used dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as t-SNE and LargeVispoorly capture the global structure of the data in the low dimensional embedding. We show this via a number of tests for the DR methods that can be easily applied by any practitioner to the dataset at hand. Surprisingly enough, t-SNE performs the best w.r.t. the commonly used measures that reward the local neighborhood accuracy such as precision-recall while having the worst performance in our tests for global structure. We then contrast the performance of these two DR methodagainst our new method called TriMap. The main idea behind TriMap is to capture higher orders of structure with triplet information (instead of pairwise information used by t-SNE and LargeVis), and to minimize a robust loss function for satisfying the chosen triplets. We provide compelling experimental evidence on large natural datasets for the clear advantage of the TriMap DR results. As LargeVis, TriMap is fast and and provides comparable runtime on large datasets.
01	Autoencoder reconstructions are widely used for the task of unsupervised anomaly localization. Indeed, an autoencoder trained on normal data is expected to only be able to reconstruct normal features of the data, allowing the segmentation of anomalous pixels in an image via a simple comparison between the image and its autoencoder reconstruction. In practice however, local defects added to a normal image can deteriorate the whole reconstruction, making this segmentation challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose in this paper a new approach for projecting anomalous data on a autoencoder-learned normal data manifold, by using gradient descent on an energy derived from the autoencoder's loss function. This energy can be augmented with regularization terms that model priors on what constitutes the user-defined optimal projection. By iteratively updating the input of the autoencoder, we bypass the loss of high-frequency information caused by the autoencoder bottleneck. This allows to produce images of higher quality than classic reconstructions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on various anomaly localization datasets. It also shows promising results at an inpainting task on the CelebA dataset.
10	Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions, explore the given environments, and reach the desired target locations. These step-by-step navigational instructions are extremely useful in navigating new environments which the agent does not know about previously. Most recent works that study VLN observe a significant performance drop when tested on unseen environments (i.e., environments not used in training), indicating that the neural agent models are highly biased towards training environments. Although this issue is considered as one of major challenges in VLN research, it is still under-studied and needs a clearer explanation. In this work, we design novel diagnosis experiments via environment re-splitting and feature replacement, looking into possible reasons of this environment bias. We observe that neither the language nor the underlying navigational graph, but the low-level visual appearance conveyed by ResNet features directly affects the agent model and contributes to this environment bias in results. According to this observation, we explore several kinds of semantic representations which contain less low-level visual information, hence the agent learned with these features could be better generalized to unseen testing environments. Without modifying the baseline agent model and its training method, our explored semantic features significantly decrease the performance gap between seen and unseen on multiple datasets (i.e., 8.6% to 0.2% on R2R, 23.9% to 0.1% on R4R, and 3.74 to 0.17 on CVDN) and achieve competitive unseen results to previous state-of-the-art models.
10	Plain recurrent networks greatly suffer from the vanishing gradient problem while Gated Neural Networks (GNNs) such as Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) deliver promising results in many sequence learning tasks through sophisticated network designs. This paper shows how we can address this problem in a plain recurrent network by analyzing the gating mechanisms in GNNs. We propose a novel network called the Recurrent Identity Network (RIN) which allows a plain recurrent network to overcome the vanishing gradient problem while training very deep models without the use of gates. We compare this model with IRNNs and LSTMs on multiple sequence modeling benchmarks. The RINs demonstrate competitive performance and converge faster in all tasks. Notably, small RIN models produce 12%‚Äì67% higher accuracy on the Sequential and Permuted MNIST datasets and reach state-of-the-art performance on the bAbI question answering dataset.
10	We describe M√äL√âE, a meta-learning algorithm for learning a good exploration policy in the interactive contextual bandit setting. Here, an algorithm must take actions based on contexts, and learn based only on a reward signal from the action taken, thereby generating an exploration/exploitation trade-off. M√äL√âE addresses this trade-off by learning a good exploration strategy based on offline synthetic tasks, on which it can simulate the contextual bandit setting. Based on these simulations, M√äL√âE uses an imitation learning strategy to learn a good exploration policy that can then be applied to true contextual bandit tasks at test time. We compare M√äL√âE to seven strong baseline contextual bandit algorithms on a set of three hundred real-world datasets, on which it outperforms alternatives in most settings, especially when differences in rewards are large. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of having a rich feature representation for learning how to explore.
10	We propose a model that learns to perform zero-shot classification using a meta-learner that is trained to produce a correction to the output of a previously trained learner. The model consists of two modules: a task module that supplies an initial prediction, and a correction module that updates the initial prediction. The task module is the learner and the correction module is the meta-learner. The correction module is trained in an episodic approach whereby many different task modules are trained on various subsets of the total training data, with the rest being used as unseen data for the correction module. The correction module takes as input a representation of the task module's training data so that the predicted correction is a function of the task module's training data.  The correction module is trained to update the task module's prediction to be closer to the target value. This approach leads to state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot classification on natural language class descriptions on the CUB and NAB datasets. 
10	Graph Neural Nets (GNNs) have received increasing attentions, partially due to their superior performance in many node and graph classification tasks. However, there is a lack of understanding on what they are learning and how sophisticated the learned graph functions are.  In this work, we propose a dissection of GNNs on graph classification into two parts: 1) the graph filtering, where graph-based neighbor aggregations are performed, and 2) the set function, where a set of hidden node features are composed for prediction. To study the importance of both parts, we propose to linearize them separately. We first linearize the graph filtering function, resulting Graph Feature Network (GFN), which is a simple lightweight neural net defined on a \textit{set} of graph augmented features. Further linearization of GFN's set function results in Graph Linear Network (GLN), which is a linear function. Empirically we perform evaluations on common graph classification benchmarks. To our surprise, we find that, despite the simplification, GFN could match or exceed the best accuracies produced by recently proposed GNNs (with a fraction of computation cost), while GLN underperforms significantly. Our results demonstrate the importance of non-linear set function, and suggest that linear graph filtering with non-linear set function is an efficient and powerful scheme for modeling existing graph classification benchmarks.
10	We propose an efficient online hyperparameter optimization method which uses a joint dynamical system to evaluate the gradient with respect to the hyperparameters. While similar methods are usually limited to hyperparameters with a smooth impact on the model, we show how to apply it to the probability of dropout in neural networks. Finally, we show its effectiveness on two distinct tasks.
10	There are time series that are amenable to recurrent neural network (RNN) solutions when treated as sequences, but some series, e.g. asynchronous time series, provide a richer variation of feature types than current RNN cells take into account. In order to address such situations, we introduce a unified RNN that handles five different feature types, each in a different manner. Our RNN framework separates sequential features into two groups dependent on their frequency, which we call sparse and dense features, and which affect cell updates differently. Further, we also incorporate time features at the sequential level that relate to the time between specified events in the sequence and are used to modify the cell's memory state. We also include two types of static (whole sequence level) features, one related to time and one not, which are combined with the encoder output. The experiments show that the proposed modeling framework does increase performance compared to standard cells.
10	Acceleration for reinforcement learning methods is an important and challenging theme. We introduce the Anderson acceleration technique into the value iteration, developing an accelerated value iteration algorithm that we call Anderson Accelerated Value Iteration (A2VI). We further apply our method to the Deep Q-learning algorithm, resulting in the Deep Anderson Accelerated Q-learning (DA2Q) algorithm. Our approach can be viewed as an approximation of the policy evaluation by interpolating on historical data. A2VI is more efficient than the modified policy iteration, which is a classical approximate method for policy evaluation. We give a theoretical analysis of our algorithm and conduct experiments on both toy problems and Atari games. Both the theoretical and empirical results show the effectiveness of our algorithm.
01	Recent powerful pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable performance on most of the popular datasets for reading comprehension. It is time to introduce more challenging datasets to push the development of this field towards more comprehensive reasoning of text. In this paper, we introduce a new Reading Comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning (ReClor) extracted from standardized graduate admission examinations. As earlier studies suggest, human-annotated datasets usually contain biases, which are often exploited by models to achieve high accuracy without truly understanding the text. In order to comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of models on ReClor, we propose to identify biased data points and separate them into EASY set while the rest as HARD set. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art models have an outstanding ability to capture biases contained in the dataset with high accuracy on EASY set. However, they struggle on HARD set with poor performance near that of random guess, indicating more research is needed to essentially enhance the logical reasoning ability of current models. 
10	Inferring temporally coherent data features is crucial for a large variety of learning tasks. We propose a network architecture that introduces temporal recurrent connections for the internal  state of the widely used residual blocks. We demonstrate that, with these connections, convolutional neural networks can more robustly learn stable temporal states that persist between evaluations. We demonstrate their potential for inferring high-quality super-resolution images from low resolution images produced with real-time renderers. This data arises in a wide range of applications,  and is particularly challenging as it contains a strongly aliased signal. Hence, the data differs substantially from the smooth inputs encountered  in natural videos, and existing techniques do not succeed at producing acceptable image quality. We additionally propose a series of careful adjustments of typical generative adversarial architectures for video super-resolution to arrive at a first model that can produce detailed, yet temporally coherent images from an aliased stream of inputs from a real-time renderer.
10	This paper handles a challenging problem, unseen attribute-object pair recognition, which asks a model to simultaneously recognize the attribute type and the object type of a given image while this attribute-object pair is not included in the training set. In the past years, the conventional classifier-based methods, which recognize unseen attribute-object pairs by composing separately-trained attribute classifiers and object classifiers, are strongly frustrated. Different from conventional methods, we propose a generative model with a visual pathway and a linguistic pathway. In each pathway, the attractor network is involved to learn the intrinsic feature representation to explore the inner relationship between the attribute and the object. With the learned features in both pathways, the unseen attribute-object pair is recognized by finding out the pair whose linguistic feature closely matches the visual feature of the given image. On two public datasets, our model achieves impressive experiment results, notably outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.
10	Neural Style Transfer has become a popular technique forgenerating images of distinct artistic styles using convolutional neural networks. Thisrecent success in image style transfer has raised the question ofwhether similar methods can be leveraged to alter the ‚Äústyle‚Äù of musicalaudio. In this work, we attempt long time-scale high-quality audio transferand texture synthesis in the time-domain that captures harmonic,rhythmic, and timbral elements related to musical style, using examples thatmay have different lengths and musical keys. We demonstrate the abilityto use randomly initialized convolutional neural networks to transferthese aspects of musical style from one piece onto another using 3different representations of audio: the log-magnitude of the Short TimeFourier Transform (STFT), the Mel spectrogram, and the Constant-Q Transformspectrogram. We propose using these representations as a way ofgenerating and modifying perceptually significant characteristics ofmusical audio content. We demonstrate each representation'sshortcomings and advantages over others by carefully designingneural network structures that complement the nature of musical audio. Finally, we show that the mostcompelling ‚Äústyle‚Äù transfer examples make use of an ensemble of theserepresentations to help capture the varying desired characteristics ofaudio signals.
10	Quality and diversity are two essential aspects for performance evaluation of text generation models. Quality indicates how likely the generated samples are to be real samples, and diversity indicates how much differences there are between generated samples. Though quality and diversity metrics have been widely used for evaluation, it is still not clear what the relationship is between them. In this paper, we give theoretical analysis of a multi-objective programming problem where quality and diversity are both expected to be maximized. We prove that there exists a family of Pareto-optimal solutions, giving an explanation of the widely observed tradeoff behavior between quality and diversity in practice. We also give the structure of such solutions, and show that a linear combination of quality and diversity is sufficient to measure the divergence between the generated distribution and the real distribution. Further, we derive an efficient algorithm to reach the Pareto-optimal solutions in practice, enabling a controllable quality-diversity tradeoff.
01	Bayesian inference is known to provide a general framework for incorporating prior knowledge or specific properties into machine learning models via carefully choosing a prior distribution. In this work, we propose a new type of prior distributions for convolutional neural networks, deep weight prior (DWP), that exploit generative models to encourage a specific structure of trained convolutional filters e.g., spatial correlations of weights. We define DWP in the form of an implicit distribution and propose a method for variational inference with such type of implicit priors. In experiments, we show that DWP improves the performance of Bayesian neural networks when training data are limited, and initialization of weights with samples from DWP accelerates training of conventional convolutional neural networks.
01	 Recent breakthroughs of pretrained language models have shown the effectiveness of self-supervised learning for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In addition to standard syntactic and semantic NLP tasks, pretrained models achieve strong improvements on tasks that involve real-world knowledge, suggesting that large-scale language modeling could be an implicit method to capture knowledge. In this work, we further investigate the extent to which pretrained models such as BERT capture knowledge using a zero-shot fact completion task. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective weakly supervised pretraining objective, which explicitly forces the model to incorporate knowledge about real-world entities. Models trained with our new objective yield significant improvements on the fact completion task. When applied to downstream tasks, our model consistently outperforms BERT on four entity-related question answering datasets (i.e., WebQuestions, TriviaQA, SearchQA and Quasar-T) with an average 2.7 F1 improvements and a standard fine-grained entity typing dataset (i.e., FIGER) with 5.7 accuracy gains.
10	Human world knowledge is both structured and flexible. When people see an object, they represent it not as a pixel array but as a meaningful arrangement of semantic parts. Moreover, when people refer to an object, they provide descriptions that are not merely true but also relevant in the current context. Here, we combine these two observations in order to learn fine-grained correspondences between language and contextually relevant geometric properties of 3D objects. To do this, we employed an interactive communication task with human participants to construct a large dataset containing natural utterances referring to 3D objects from ShapeNet in a wide variety of contexts. Using this dataset, we developed neural listener and speaker models with strong capacity for generalization. By performing targeted lesions of visual and linguistic input, we discovered that the neural listener depends heavily on part-related words and associates these words correctly with the corresponding geometric properties of objects, suggesting that it has learned task-relevant structure linking the two input modalities. We further show that a neural speaker that is `listener-aware' --- that plans its utterances according to how an imagined listener would interpret its words in context --- produces more discriminative referring expressions than an `listener-unaware' speaker, as measured by human performance in identifying the correct object.
01	By injecting adversarial examples into training data, adversarial training is promising for improving the robustness of deep learning models. However, most existing adversarial training approaches are based on a specific type of adversarial attack. It may not provide sufficiently representative samples from the adversarial domain, leading to a weak generalization ability on adversarial examples from other attacks. Moreover, during the adversarial training, adversarial perturbations on inputs are usually crafted by fast single-step adversaries so as to scale to large datasets. This work is mainly focused on the adversarial training yet efficient FGSM adversary. In this scenario, it is difficult to train a model with great generalization due to the lack of representative adversarial samples, aka the samples are unable to accurately reflect the adversarial domain. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Adversarial Training with Domain Adaptation (ATDA) method. Our intuition is to regard the adversarial training on FGSM adversary as a domain adaption task with limited number of target domain samples. The main idea is to learn a representation that is semantically meaningful and domain invariant on the clean domain as well as the adversarial domain. Empirical evaluations on Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ATDA can greatly improve the generalization of adversarial training and the smoothness of the learned models, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets. To show the transfer ability of our method, we also extend ATDA to the adversarial training on iterative attacks such as PGD-Adversial Training (PAT) and the defense performance is improved considerably.
10	While deep neural networks have shown outstanding results in a wide range of applications,learning from a very limited number of examples is still a challengingtask. Despite the difficulties of the few-shot learning, metric-learning techniquesshowed the potential of the neural networks for this task. While these methodsperform well, they don‚Äôt provide satisfactory results. In this work, the idea ofmetric-learning is extended with Support Vector Machines (SVM) working mechanism,which is well known for generalization capabilities on a small dataset.Furthermore, this paper presents an end-to-end learning framework for trainingadaptive kernel SVMs, which eliminates the problem of choosing a correct kerneland good features for SVMs. Next, the one-shot learning problem is redefinedfor audio signals. Then the model was tested on vision task (using Omniglotdataset) and speech task (using TIMIT dataset) as well. Actually, the algorithmusing Omniglot dataset improved accuracy from 98.1% to 98.5% on the one-shotclassification task and from 98.9% to 99.3% on the few-shot classification task.
01	Federated learning improves data privacy and efficiency in machine learning performed over networks of distributed devices, such as mobile phones, IoT and wearable devices, etc. Yet models trained with federated learning can still fail to generalize to new devices due to the problem of domain shift. Domain shift occurs when the labeled data collected by source nodes statistically differs from the target node's unlabeled data. In this work, we present a principled approach to the problem of federated domain adaptation, which aims to align the representations learned among the different nodes with the data distribution of the target node. Our approach extends adversarial adaptation techniques to the constraints of the federated setting. In addition, we devise a dynamic attention mechanism and leverage feature disentanglement to enhance knowledge transfer. Empirically, we perform extensive experiments on several image and text classification tasks and show promising results under unsupervised federated domain adaptation setting.
10	We introduce a novel approach to tree-to-tree learning, the neural tree transducer (NTT), a top-down depth first context-sensitive tree decoder, which is paired with recursive neural encoders. Our method works purely on tree-to-tree manipulations rather than sequence-to-tree or tree-to-sequence and is able to encode and decode multiple depth trees. We compare our method to sequence-to-sequence models applied to serializations of the trees and show that our method outperforms previous methods for tree-to-tree transduction. 
10	Text classification must sometimes be applied in situations with no training data in a target language.  However, training data may be available in a related language.  We introduce a cross-lingual document classification framework CACO between related language pairs.  To best use limited training data, our transfer learning scheme exploits cross-lingual subword similarity by jointly training a character-based embedder and a word-based classifier.  The embedder derives vector representations for input words from their written forms, and the classifier makes predictions based on the word vectors.  We use a joint character representation for both the source language and the target language, which allows the embedder to generalize knowledge about source language words to target language words with similar forms.  We propose a multi-task objective that can further improve the model if additional cross-lingual or monolingual resources are available.  CACO models trained under low-resource settings rival cross-lingual word embedding models trained under high-resource settings on related language pairs.
10	In this paper, we introduce Random Path Generative Adversarial Network (RPGAN) --- an alternative scheme of GANs that can serve as a tool for generative model analysis. While the latent space of a typical GAN consists of input vectors, randomly sampled from the standard Gaussian distribution, the latent space of RPGAN consists of random paths in a generator network. As we show, this design allows to associate different layers of the generator with different regions of the latent space, providing their natural interpretability. With experiments on standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that RPGAN reveals several interesting insights about roles that different layers play in the image generation process. Aside from interpretability, the RPGAN model also provides competitive generation quality and allows efficient incremental learning on new data.
10	Feature selection problems have been extensively studied in the setting oflinear estimation, for instance LASSO, but less emphasis has been placed onfeature selection for non-linear functions. In this study, we propose a methodfor feature selection in high-dimensional non-linear function estimationproblems. The new procedure is based on directly penalizing the $\ell_0$ norm offeatures, or the count of the number of selected features. Our $\ell_0$ based regularization relies on a continuous relaxation of the Bernoulli distribution, whichallows our model to learn the parameters of the approximate Bernoullidistributions via gradient descent. The proposed framework simultaneously learnsa non-linear regression or classification function while selecting a smallsubset of features. We provide an information-theoretic justification forincorporating Bernoulli distribution into our approach. Furthermore, we evaluateour method using synthetic and real-life data and demonstrate that our approachoutperforms other embedded methods in terms of predictive performance and feature selection.
01	State-of-the-art machine learning methods exhibit limited compositional generalization. At the same time, there is a lack of realistic benchmarks that comprehensively measure this ability, which makes it challenging to find and evaluate improvements. We introduce a novel method to systematically construct such benchmarks by maximizing compound divergence while guaranteeing a small atom divergence between train and test sets, and we quantitatively compare this method to other approaches for creating compositional generalization benchmarks. We present a large and realistic natural language question answering dataset that is constructed according to this method, and we use it to analyze the compositional generalization ability of three machine learning architectures. We find that they fail to generalize compositionally and that there is a surprisingly strong negative correlation between compound divergence and accuracy. We also demonstrate how our method can be used to create new compositionality benchmarks on top of the existing SCAN dataset, which confirms these findings.
10	The character-based model, such as BERT, has achieved remarkable success in Chinese named entity recognition (NER). However, such model would likely miss the overall information of the entity words. In this paper, we propose to combine priori entity information with BERT. Instead of relying on additional lexicons or pre-trained word embeddings, our model has generated entity classification embeddings directly on the pre-trained BERT, having the merit of increasing model practicability and avoiding OOV problem. Experiments show that our model has achieved state-of-the-art results on 3 Chinese NER datasets.
10	Learning from a few examples is a key characteristic of human intelligence that inspired machine learning researchers to build data-efficient AI models. Recent progress has shown that few-shot learning can be improved with access to unlabelled data,  known as semi-supervised few-shot learning(SS-FSL). We introduce an SS-FSL approach, dubbed as Prototypical Random Walk Networks (PRWN), built on top of Prototypical Networks (PN). We develop a random walk semi-supervised loss that enables the network to learn representations that are compact and well-separated. Our work is related to the very recent development on graph-based approaches for few-shot learning. However, we show that achieved compact and well-separated class embeddings can be achieved by our prototypical random walk notion without needing additional graph-NN parameters or requiring a transductive setting where collective test set is provided. Our model outperforms prior art in most benchmarks with significant improvements in some cases. For example, in a mini-Imagenet 5-shot classification task, we obtain 69.65% accuracy to the 64.59% state-of-the-art. Our model, trained with 40% of the data as labelled, compares competitively against fully supervised prototypical networks, trained on 100% of the labels, even outperforming it in the 1-shot mini-Imagenet case with 50.89% to 49.4% accuracy.  We also show that our model is resistant to distractors, unlabeled data that does not belong to any of the training classes, and hence reflecting robustness to labelled/unlabelled class distribution mismatch. We also performed a challenging discriminative power test, showing a relative improvement on top of the baseline of 14% on 20 classes on mini-Imagenet and 60% on 800 classes on Ominiglot.
10	We introduce ``TriMap''; a dimensionality reduction technique based on triplet constraints that preserves the global accuracy of the data  better than the other commonly used methods such as t-SNE, LargeVis, and UMAP. To quantify the global accuracy, we introduce a score which roughly reflects the relative placement of the clusters rather than the individual points. We empirically show the excellent performance of TriMap on a large variety of datasets in terms of the quality of the embedding as well as the runtime. On our performance benchmarks, TriMap easily scales to millions of points without depleting the memory and clearly outperforms t-SNE, LargeVis, and UMAP in terms of runtime.
10	This paper introduces HybridNet, a hybrid neural network to speed-up autoregressivemodels for raw audio waveform generation. As an example, we proposea hybrid model that combines an autoregressive network named WaveNet and aconventional LSTM model to address speech synthesis. Instead of generatingone sample per time-step, the proposed HybridNet generates multiple samples pertime-step by exploiting the long-term memory utilization property of LSTMs. Inthe evaluation, when applied to text-to-speech, HybridNet yields state-of-art performance.HybridNet achieves a 3.83 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score onUS English, largely outperforming the same size WaveNet in terms of naturalnessand provide 2x speed up at inference.
01	Although reinforcement learning methods can achieve impressive results in simulation, the real world presents two major challenges: generating samples is exceedingly expensive, and unexpected perturbations or unseen situations cause proficient but specialized policies to fail at test time. Given that it is impractical to train separate policies to accommodate all situations the agent may see in the real world, this work proposes to learn how to quickly and effectively adapt online to new tasks. To enable sample-efficient learning, we consider learning online adaptation in the context of model-based reinforcement learning. Our approach uses meta-learning to train a dynamics model prior such that, when combined with recent data, this prior can be rapidly adapted to the local context. Our experiments demonstrate online adaptation for continuous control tasks on both simulated and real-world agents. We first show simulated agents adapting their behavior online to novel terrains, crippled body parts, and highly-dynamic environments. We also illustrate the importance of incorporating online adaptation into autonomous agents that operate in the real world by applying our method to a real dynamic legged millirobot: We demonstrate the agent's learned ability to quickly adapt online to a missing leg, adjust to novel terrains and slopes, account for miscalibration or errors in pose estimation, and compensate for pulling payloads.
01	Due to their complex nature, it is hard to characterize the ways in which machine learning models can misbehave or be exploited when deployed. Recent work on adversarial examples, i.e. inputs with minor perturbations that result in substantially different model predictions, is helpful in evaluating the robustness of these models by exposing the adversarial scenarios where they fail. However, these malicious perturbations are often unnatural, not semantically meaningful, and not applicable to complicated domains such as language. In this paper, we propose a framework to generate natural and legible adversarial examples that lie on the data manifold, by searching in semantic space of dense and continuous data representation, utilizing the recent advances in generative adversarial networks. We present generated adversaries to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for black-box classifiers for a wide range of applications such as image classification, textual entailment, and machine translation. We include experiments to show that the generated adversaries are natural, legible to humans, and useful in evaluating and analyzing black-box classifiers.
01	Many machine learning image classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, inputs with perturbations designed to intentionally trigger misclassification. Current adversarial methods directly alter pixel colors and evaluate against pixel norm-balls: pixel perturbations smaller than a specified magnitude, according to a measurement norm. This evaluation, however, has limited practical utility since perturbations in the pixel space do not correspond to underlying real-world phenomena of image formation that lead to them and has no security motivation attached. Pixels in natural images are measurements of light that has interacted with the geometry of a physical scene. As such, we propose a novel evaluation measure, parametric norm-balls, by directly perturbing physical parameters that underly image formation. One enabling contribution we present is a physically-based differentiable renderer that allows us to propagate pixel gradients to the parametric space of lighting and geometry. Our approach enables physically-based adversarial attacks, and our differentiable renderer leverages models from the interactive rendering literature to balance the performance and accuracy trade-offs necessary for a memory-efficient and scalable adversarial data augmentation workflow.
10	Learning effective document-level representation is essential in many important NLP tasks such as document classification, summarization, etc. Recent research has shown that simple weighted averaging of word vectors is an effective way to represent sentences, often outperforming complicated seq2seq neural models in many tasks. While it is desirable to use the same method to represent documents as well, unfortunately, the effectiveness is lost when representing long documents involving multiple sentences. One reason for this degradation is due to the fact that a longer document is likely to contain words from many different themes (or topics), and hence creating a single vector while ignoring all the thematic structure is unlikely to yield an effective representation of the document. This problem is less acute in single sentences and other short text fragments where presence of a single theme/topic is most likely. To overcome this problem, in this paper we present PSIF, a partitioned word averaging model to represent long documents. P-SIF retains the simplicity of simple weighted word averaging while taking a document's thematic structure into account. In particular, P-SIF learns topic-specific vectors from a document and finally concatenates them all to represent the overall document. Through our experiments over multiple real-world datasets and tasks, we demonstrate PSIF's effectiveness compared to simple weighted averaging and many other state-of-the-art baselines. We also show that PSIF is particularly effective in representing long multi-sentence documents. We will release PSIF's embedding source code and data-sets for reproducing results.
01	Meta-learning allows an intelligent agent to leverage prior learning episodes as a basis for quickly improving performance on a novel task. Bayesian hierarchical modeling provides a theoretical framework for formalizing meta-learning as inference for a set of parameters that are shared across tasks. Here, we reformulate the model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML) of Finn et al. (2017) as a method for probabilistic inference in a hierarchical Bayesian model. In contrast to prior methods for meta-learning via hierarchical Bayes, MAML is naturally applicable to complex function approximators through its use of a scalable gradient descent procedure for posterior inference. Furthermore, the identification of MAML as hierarchical Bayes provides a way to understand the algorithm‚Äôs operation as a meta-learning procedure, as well as an opportunity to make use of computational strategies for efficient inference. We use this opportunity to propose an improvement to the MAML algorithm that makes use of techniques from approximate inference and curvature estimation.
10	In many real-world settings, a learning model must perform few-shot classification: learn to classify examples from unseen classes using only a few labeled examples per class.Additionally, to be safely deployed, it should have the ability to detect out-of-distribution inputs: examples that do not belong to any of the classes.While both few-shot classification and out-of-distribution detection are popular topics,their combination has not been studied. In this work, we propose tasks for out-of-distribution detection in the few-shot setting and establish benchmark datasets, based on four popular few-shot classification datasets.  Then, we propose two new methods for this task and investigate their performance.In sum, we establish baseline out-of-distribution detection results using standard metrics on new benchmark datasets and show improved results with our proposed methods.
10	We present a novel approach for training neural abstract architectures which in- corporates (partial) supervision over the machine‚Äôs interpretable components. To cleanly capture the set of neural architectures to which our method applies, we introduce the concept of a differential neural computational machine (‚àÇNCM) and show that several existing architectures (e.g., NTMs, NRAMs) can be instantiated as a ‚àÇNCM and can thus benefit from any amount of additional supervision over their interpretable components. Based on our method, we performed a detailed experimental evaluation with both, the NTM and NRAM architectures, and showed that the approach leads to significantly better convergence and generalization capabilities of the learning phase than when training using only input-output examples.
10	Adversarial examples are considered a serious issue for safety critical applications of AI,  such as finance, autonomous vehicle control and medicinal applications. Though significant work has resulted in increased robustness of systems to these attacks, systems are still vulnerable to well-crafted attacks. To address this problemseveral adversarial attack detection methods have been proposed. However, system can still be vulnerable to adversarial samples that are designed to specifically evade these detection methods. One recent detection scheme that has shown good performance is based on uncertainty estimates derived from Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles. Prior Networks, a new method of estimating predictive uncertainty, have been shown to outperform Monte-Carlo dropout on a range of tasks. One of the advantages of this approach is that the behaviour of a Prior Network can be explicitly tuned to, for example, predict high uncertainty in regions where there are no training data samples. In this work Prior Networks are applied to adversarial attack detection using measures of uncertainty in a similar fashion to Monte-Carlo Dropout. Detection based on measures of uncertainty derived from DNNs and Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles are used as a baseline. Prior Networks are shown to significantly out-perform these baseline approaches over a range of adversarial attacks in both detection of whitebox and blackbox configurations. Even when the adversarial attacks are constructed with full knowledge of the detection mechanism, it is shown to be highly challenging to successfully generate an adversarial sample.
10	"Learning representations of data samples in an unsupervised way is needed whenever computers have to reason about unlabeled data. Applications range from compressing and denoising data to super-resolution, generating new samples from a given sample distribution and much more.In this work, we use information entropy and a little game to motivate a new encoder discriminator architecture in order to learn unsupervised latent representations. Inspired by the game ""Taboo"", we train an encoder network to generate a meaningful representation of one particular sample of a dataset. Using this description, a discriminator network then has to retrieve the same sample from the whole dataset. We show that learning in this manner on many different samples repeatedly minimizes the information entropy given the latent description and, thus, forces the encoder network to make precise descriptions that can be interpreted by the discriminator.We provide first results of this method on the MNIST and the Fashion MNIST dataset."
01	Improving the sample efficiency in reinforcement learning has been a long-standing research problem. In this work, we aim to reduce the sample complexity of existing policy gradient methods. We propose a novel policy gradient algorithm called SRVR-PG, which only requires $O(1/\epsilon^{3/2})$\footnote{$O(\cdot)$ notation hides constant factors.} episodes to find an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the nonconcave performance function $J(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ (i.e., $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ such that $\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta})\|_2^2\leq\epsilon$). This sample complexity improves the existing result $O(1/\epsilon^{5/3})$ for stochastic variance reduced policy gradient algorithms by a factor of $O(1/\epsilon^{1/6})$. In addition, we also propose a variant of SRVR-PG with parameter exploration, which explores the initial policy parameter from a prior probability distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on classic control problems in reinforcement learning to validate the performance of our proposed algorithms.
01	"``""Overlearning'' means that a model trained for a seemingly simpleobjective implicitly learns to recognize attributes and concepts that are(1) not part of the learning objective, and (2) sensitive from a privacyor bias perspective.  For example, a binary gender classifier of facialimages also learns to recognize races, even races that arenot represented in the training data, and identities.We demonstrate overlearning in several vision and NLP models and analyzeits harmful consequences.  First, inference-time representations of anoverlearned model reveal sensitive attributes of the input, breakingprivacy protections such as model partitioning.  Second, an overlearnedmodel can be ""`re-purposed'' for a different, privacy-violating taskeven in the absence of the original training data.We show that overlearning is intrinsic for some tasks and cannot beprevented by censoring unwanted attributes.  Finally, we investigatewhere, when, and why overlearning happens during model training."
01	Lack of reliability is a well-known issue for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. This problem has gained increasing attention in recent years, and efforts to improve it have grown substantially. To aid RL researchers and production users with the evaluation and improvement of reliability, we propose a set of metrics that quantitatively measure different aspects of reliability. In this work, we focus on variability and risk, both during training and after learning (on a fixed policy). We designed these metrics to be general-purpose, and we also designed complementary statistical tests to enable rigorous comparisons on these metrics. In this paper, we first describe the desired properties of the metrics and their design, the aspects of reliability that they measure, and their applicability to different scenarios. We then describe the statistical tests and make additional practical recommendations for reporting results. The metrics and accompanying statistical tools have been made available as an open-source library. We apply our metrics to a set of common RL algorithms and environments, compare them, and analyze the results.
10	Combining domain knowledge models with neural models has been challenging.  End-to-end trained neural models often perform better (lower Mean Square Error) than domain knowledge models or domain/neural combinations, and the combination is inefficient to train.  In this paper, we demonstrate that by composing domain models with machine learning models, by using extrapolative testing sets, and invoking decorrelation objective functions, we create models which can predict more complex systems. The models are interpretable, extrapolative, data-efficient, and capture predictable but complex non-stochastic behavior such as unmodeled degrees of freedom and systemic measurement noise.  We apply this improved modeling paradigm to several simulated systems and an actual physical system in the context of system identification.   Several ways of composing domain models with neural models are examined for time series, boosting, bagging, and auto-encoding on various systems of varying complexity and non-linearity.  Although this work is preliminary, we show that the ability to combine models is a very promising direction for neural modeling.
10	Ranking is a central task in machine learning and information retrieval. In this task, it is especially important to present the user with a slate of items that is appealing as a whole. This in turn requires taking into account interactions between items, since intuitively, placing an item on the slate affects the decision of which other items should be chosen alongside it.In this work, we propose a sequence-to-sequence model for ranking called seq2slate. At each step, the model predicts the next item to place on the slate given the items already chosen. The recurrent nature of the model allows complex dependencies between items to be captured directly in a flexible and scalable way. We show how to learn the model end-to-end from weak supervision in the form of easily obtained click-through data. We further demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in experiments on standard ranking benchmarks as well as in a real-world recommendation system.
01	Black-box attack methods aim to infer suitable attack patterns to targeted DNN models by only using output feedback of the models and the corresponding input queries. However, due to lack of prior and inefficiency in leveraging the query and feedback information, existing methods are mostly query-intensive for obtaining effective attack patterns. In this work, we propose a meta attack approach that is capable of attacking a targeted  model with much fewer queries. Its high query-efficiency stems from effective utilization of  meta learning approaches in learning generalizable prior abstraction from the previously observed attack patterns and exploiting  such prior to help infer attack patterns from only a few queries and outputs. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10 and tiny-Imagenet demonstrate that our meta-attack method can remarkably reduce the number of model queries without sacrificing the attack performance. Besides, the obtained meta attacker is not restricted to a particular model but can be used easily with a fast adaptive ability to attack a variety of models. Our code will be released to the public.
10	Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) research has grown significantly in recent years. A number of software offerings now exist that provide stable, comprehensive implementations for benchmarking. At the same time, recent deep RL researchhas become more diverse in its goals. In this paper we introduce Dopamine, a new research framework for deep RL that aims to support some of that diversity. Dopamine is open-source, TensorFlow-based, and provides compact yet reliableimplementations of some state-of-the-art deep RL agents. We complement this offering with a taxonomy of the different research objectives in deep RL research. While by no means exhaustive, our analysis highlights the heterogeneity of researchin the field, and the value of frameworks such as ours.
10	Developing conditional generative models for text-to-video synthesis is an extremely challenging yet an important topic of research in machine learning. In this work, we address this problem by introducing Text-Filter conditioning Generative Adversarial Network (TFGAN), a GAN model with novel conditioning scheme that aids improving the text-video associations. With a combination of this conditioning scheme and a deep GAN architecture, TFGAN generates photo-realistic videos from text on very challenging real-world video datasets. In addition, we construct a benchmark synthetic dataset of moving shapes to systematically evaluate our conditioning scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFGAN significantly outperforms the existing approaches, and can also generate videos of novel categories not seen during training.
10	Recent work on critical initializations of deep neural networks has shown that by constraining the spectrum of input-output Jacobians allows for fast training of very deep networks without skip connections. The current understanding of this class of initializations is limited with respect to classical notions from optimization. In particular, the connections between Jacobian eigenvalues and curvature of the parameter space are unknown. Similarly, there is no firm understanding of the effects of maintaining orthogonality during training. With this work we complement the existing understanding of critical initializations and show that the curvature is proportional to the maximum singular value of the Jacobian. Furthermore we show that optimization under orthogonality constraints ameliorates the dependence on choice of initial parameters, but is not strictly necessary.
10	We present a novel approach to train a natural media painting using reinforcement learning. Given a reference image,  our formulation is based on stroke-based rendering that  imitates human drawing and can be learned from scratch without supervision. Our painting agent computes a sequence of actions that represent the primitive painting strokes. In order to ensure that the generated policy is predictable and controllable, we use a constrained learning method and train the painting agent  using the environment model and follows the commands encoded in an observation. We have applied our approach on many benchmarks and our results demonstrate that our constrained agent can handle different painting media and different constraints in the action space to collaborate with humans or other agents.
01	We propose RaPP, a new methodology for novelty detection by utilizing hidden space activation values obtained from a deep autoencoder.Precisely, RaPP compares input and its autoencoder reconstruction not only in the input space but also in the hidden spaces.We show that if we feed a reconstructed input to the same autoencoder again, its activated values in a hidden space are equivalent to the corresponding reconstruction in that hidden space given the original input.In order to aggregate the hidden space activation values, we propose two metrics, which enhance the novelty detection performance.Through extensive experiments using diverse datasets, we validate that RaPP improves novelty detection performances of autoencoder-based approaches.Besides, we show that RaPP outperforms recent novelty detection methods evaluated on popular benchmarks.
10	Decision-time planning policies with implicit dynamics models have been shown to work in discrete action spaces with Q learning. However, decision-time planning with implicit dynamics models in continuous action space has proven to be a difficult problem. Recent work in Reinforcement Learning has allowed for implicit model based approaches to be extended to Policy Gradient methods. In this work we propose Policy Tree Network (PTN). Policy Tree Network lies at the intersection of Model-Based Reinforcement Learning and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning. Policy Tree Network is a novel approach which, for the first time, demonstrates how to leverage an implicit model to perform decision-time planning with Policy Gradient methods in continuous action spaces. This work is empirically justified on 8 standard MuJoCo environments so that it can easily be compared with similar work done in this area. Additionally, we offer a lower bound on the worst case change in the mean of the policy when tree planning is used and theoretically justify our design choices.
10	Discovering the underlying mathematical expressions describing a dataset is a core challenge for artificial intelligence. This is the problem of symbolic regression. Despite recent advances in training neural networks to solve complex tasks, deep learning approaches to symbolic regression are lacking. We propose a framework that combines deep learning with symbolic regression via a simple idea: use a large model to search the space of small models. More specifically, we use a recurrent neural network to emit a distribution over tractable mathematical expressions, and employ reinforcement learning to train the network to generate better-fitting expressions. Our algorithm significantly outperforms standard genetic programming-based symbolic regression in its ability to exactly recover symbolic expressions on a series of benchmark problems, both with and without added noise. More broadly, our contributions include a framework that can be applied to optimize hierarchical, variable-length objects under a black-box performance metric, with the ability to incorporate a priori constraints in situ.
01	Since their invention, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a popular approach for learning to model a distribution of real (unlabeled) data. Convergence problems during training are overcome by Wasserstein GANs which minimize the distance between the model and the empirical distribution in terms of a different metric, but thereby introduce a Lipschitz constraint into the optimization problem. A simple way to enforce the Lipschitz constraint on the class of functions, which can be modeled by the neural network, is weight clipping. Augmenting the loss by a regularization term that penalizes the deviation of the gradient norm of the critic (as a function of the network's input) from one, was proposed as an alternative that improves training. We present theoretical arguments why using a weaker regularization term enforcing the Lipschitz constraint is preferable. These arguments are supported by experimental results on several data sets.
01	Model pruning has become a useful technique that improves the computational efficiency of deep learning, making it possible to deploy solutions in resource-limited scenarios. A widely-used practice in relevant work assumes that a smaller-norm parameter or feature plays a less informative role at the inference time. In this paper, we propose a channel pruning technique for accelerating the computations of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that does not critically rely on this assumption. Instead, it focuses on direct simplification of the channel-to-channel computation graph of a CNN without the need of performing a computationally difficult and not-always-useful task of making high-dimensional tensors of CNN structured sparse. Our approach takes two stages: first to adopt an end-to-end stochastic training method that eventually forces the outputs of some channels to be constant, and then to prune those constant channels from the original neural network by adjusting the biases of their impacting layers such that the resulting compact model can be quickly fine-tuned. Our approach is mathematically appealing from an optimization perspective and easy to reproduce. We experimented our approach through several image learning benchmarks and demonstrate its interest- ing aspects and competitive performance.
10	A point cloud is an agile 3D representation, efficiently modeling an object's surface geometry. However, these surface-centric properties also pose challenges on designing tools to recognize and synthesize point clouds. This work presents a novel autoregressive model, PointGrow, which generates realistic point cloud samples from scratch or conditioned from given semantic contexts. Our model operates recurrently, with each point sampled according to a conditional distribution given its previously-generated points. Since point cloud object shapes are typically encoded by long-range interpoint dependencies, we augment our model with dedicated self-attention modules to capture these relations. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that PointGrow achieves satisfying performance on both unconditional and conditional point cloud generation tasks, with respect to fidelity, diversity and semantic preservation. Further, conditional PointGrow learns a smooth manifold of given images where 3D shape interpolation and arithmetic calculation can be performed inside.
10	We investigate methods for semi-supervised learning (SSL) of a neural linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) for Named Entity Recognition (NER) by treating the tagger as the amortized variational posterior in a generative model of text given tags. We first illustrate how to incorporate a CRF in a VAE, enabling end-to-end training on semi-supervised data. We then investigate a series of increasingly complex deep generative models of tokens given tags enabled by end-to-end optimization, comparing the proposed models against supervised and strong CRF SSL baselines on the Ontonotes5 NER dataset. We find that our best proposed model consistently improves performance by $\approx 1\%$ F1 in low- and moderate-resource regimes and easily addresses degenerate model behavior in a more difficult, partially supervised setting.
10	Distributed computing can significantly reduce the training time of neural networks. Despite its potential, however, distributed training has not been widely adopted: scaling the training process is difficult, and existing SGD methods require substantial tuning of hyperparameters and learning schedules to achieve sufficient accuracy when increasing the number of workers. In practice, such tuning can be prohibitively expensive given the huge number of potential hyperparameter configurations and the effort required to test each one.    We propose DANA, a novel approach that scales out-of-the-box to large clusters using the same hyperparameters and learning schedule optimized for training on a single worker, while maintaining similar final accuracy without additional overhead. DANA estimates the future value of model parameters by adapting Nesterov Accelerated Gradient to a distributed setting, and so mitigates the effect of gradient staleness, one of the main difficulties in scaling SGD to more workers.Evaluation on three state-of-the-art network architectures and three datasets shows that DANA scales as well as or better than existing work without having to tune any hyperparameters or tweak the learning schedule. For example, DANA achieves 75.73% accuracy on ImageNet when training ResNet-50 with 16 workers, similar to the non-distributed baseline.
10	As deep learning applications are becoming more and more pervasive, the question of evaluating the reliability of a prediction becomes a central question in the machine learning community. This domain, known as predictive uncertainty, has come under the scrutiny of research groups developing Bayesian approaches to deep learning such as Monte Carlo Dropout. Unfortunately, for the time being, the real goal of predictive uncertainty has been swept under the rug. Indeed, Bayesian approaches are solely evaluated in terms of raw performance of the prediction, while the quality of the estimated uncertainty is not assessed. One contribution of this article is to draw attention on existing metrics developed in the forecast community, designed to evaluate both the sharpness and the calibration of predictive uncertainty. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and calibration to the consistency between the predicted uncertainty level and the actual errors. We further analyze the behavior of these metrics on regression problems when deep convolutional networks are involved and for several current predictive uncertainty approaches. A second contribution of this article is to propose an alternative metric that is more adapted to the evaluation of relative uncertainty assessment and directly applicable to regression with deep learning. This metric is evaluated and compared with existing ones on a toy dataset as well as on the problem of monocular depth estimation. 
10	We introduce CuLE (CUDA Learning Environment), a CUDA port of the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) which is used for the development of deep reinforcement algorithms.  CuLE overcomes many limitations of existing CPU-based emulators and scales naturally to multiple GPUs. It leverages GPU parallelization to run thousands of games simultaneously and it renders frames directly on the GPU, to avoid the bottleneck arising from the limited CPU-GPU communication bandwidth. CuLE generates up to 155M frames per hour on a single GPU, a finding previously achieved only through a cluster of CPUs. Beyond highlighting the differences between CPU and GPU emulators in the context of reinforcement learning, we show how to leverage the high throughput of CuLE by effective batching of the training data, and show accelerated convergence for A2C+V-trace. CuLE is available at [hidden URL].
10	Given a set of distances amongst points, determining what metric representation is most ‚Äúconsistent‚Äù with the input distances or the metric that captures the relevant geometric features of the data is a key step in many machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we focus on metric constrained problems, a class of optimization problems with metric constraints. In particular, we identify three types of metric constrained problems: metric nearness Brickell et al. (2008), weighted correlation clustering on general graphs Bansal et al. (2004), and metric learning Bellet et al. (2013); Davis et al. (2007). Because of the large number of constraints in these problems, however, researchers have been forced to restrict either the kinds of metrics learned or the size of the problem that can be solved.We provide an algorithm, PROJECT AND FORGET, that uses Bregman projections with cutting planes, to solve metric constrained problems with many (possibly exponentially) inequality constraints. We also prove that our algorithm converges to the global optimal solution. Additionally, we show that the optimality error (L2 distance of the current iterate to the optimal) asymptotically decays at an exponential rate. We show that using our method we can solve large problem instances of three types of metric constrained problems, out-performing all state of the art methods with respect to CPU times and problem sizes.
01	We address a learning-to-normalize problem by proposing Switchable Normalization (SN), which learns to select different normalizers for different normalization layers of a deep neural network. SN employs three distinct scopes to compute statistics (means and variances) including a channel, a layer, and a minibatch. SN switches between them by learning their importance weights in an end-to-end manner. It has several good properties. First, it adapts to various network architectures and tasks (see Fig.1). Second, it is robust to a wide range of batch sizes, maintaining high performance even when small minibatch is presented (e.g. 2 images/GPU). Third, SN does not have sensitive hyper-parameter, unlike group normalization that searches the number of groups as a hyper-parameter. Without bells and whistles, SN outperforms its counterparts on various challenging benchmarks, such as ImageNet, COCO, CityScapes, ADE20K, and Kinetics. Analyses of SN are also presented. We hope SN will help ease the usage and understand the normalization techniques in deep learning. The code of SN will be released.
10	In order for machine learning to be deployed and trusted in many applications, it is crucial to be able to reliably explain why the machine learning algorithm makes certain predictions. For example, if an algorithm classifies a given pathology image to be a malignant tumor, then the doctor may need to know which parts of the image led the algorithm to this classification. How to interpret black-box predictors is thus an important and active area of research.  A fundamental question is: how much can we trust the interpretation itself? In this paper, we show that interpretation of deep learning predictions is extremely fragile in the following sense:  two perceptively indistinguishable inputs with the same predicted label can be assigned very different}interpretations. We systematically characterize the fragility of the interpretations generated by several widely-used feature-importance interpretation methods (saliency maps, integrated gradient, and DeepLIFT) on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. Our experiments show that even small random perturbation can change the feature importance and new systematic perturbations can lead to dramatically different interpretations without changing the label. We extend these results to show that interpretations based on exemplars (e.g. influence functions) are similarly fragile. Our analysis of the geometry of the Hessian matrix gives insight on why fragility could be a fundamental challenge to the current interpretation approaches.
10	Learning rate decay (lrDecay) is a \emph{de facto} technique for training modern neural networks. It starts with a large learning rate and then decays it multiple times. It is empirically observed to help both optimization and generalization. Common beliefs in how lrDecay works come from the optimization analysis of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent: 1) an initially large learning rate accelerates training or helps the network escape spurious local minima; 2) decaying the learning rate helps the network converge to a local minimum and avoid oscillation. Despite the popularity of these common beliefs, experiments suggest that they are insufficient in explaining the general effectiveness of lrDecay in training modern neural networks that are deep, wide, and nonconvex. We provide another novel explanation: an initially large learning rate suppresses the network from memorizing noisy data while decaying the learning rate improves the learning of complex patterns. The proposed explanation is validated on a carefully-constructed dataset with tractable pattern complexity. And its implication, that additional patterns learned in later stages of lrDecay are more complex and thus less transferable, is justified in real-world datasets. We believe that this alternative explanation will shed light into the design of better training strategies for modern neural networks.
01	Dual learning has attracted much attention in machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing communities. The core idea of dual learning is to leverage the duality between the primal task (mapping from domain X to domain Y) and dual task (mapping from domain Y to X) to boost the performances of both tasks. Existing dual learning framework forms a system with two agents (one primal model and one dual model) to utilize such duality. In this paper, we extend this framework by introducing multiple primal and dual models, and propose the multi-agent dual learning framework. Experiments on neural machine translation and image translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the new framework. In particular, we set a new record on IWSLT 2014 German-to-English translation with a 35.44 BLEU score, achieve a 31.03 BLEU score on WMT 2014 English-to-German translation with over 2.6 BLEU improvement over the strong Transformer baseline, and set a new record of 49.61 BLEU score on the recent WMT 2018 English-to-German translation.
01	Generative Adversarial Networks are one of the leading tools in generative modeling, image editing and content creation. However, they are hard to train as they require a delicate balancing act between two deep networks fighting a never ending duel. Some of the most promising adversarial models today minimize a Wasserstein objective. It is smoother and more stable to optimize. In this paper, we show that the Wasserstein distance is just one out of a large family of objective functions that yield these properties. By making the discriminator of a GAN robust to adversarial attacks we can turn any GAN objective into a smooth and stable loss. We experimentally show that any GAN objective, including Wasserstein GANs, benefit from adversarial robustness both quantitatively and qualitatively. The training additionally becomes more robust to suboptimal choices of hyperparameters, model architectures, or objective functions.
01	We introduce a new dataset of logical entailments for the purpose of measuring models' ability to capture and exploit the structure of logical expressions against an entailment prediction task. We use this task to compare a series of architectures which are ubiquitous in the sequence-processing literature, in addition to a new model class---PossibleWorldNets---which computes entailment as a ``convolution over possible worlds''. Results show that convolutional networks present the wrong inductive bias for this class of problems relative to LSTM RNNs, tree-structured neural networks outperform LSTM RNNs due to their enhanced ability to exploit the syntax of logic, and PossibleWorldNets outperform all benchmarks.
01	 Neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been attracting increasing attention in various research domains recently.  There have been some works studying optimization issues and approximation capabilities of neural ODEs, but their robustness is still yet unclear. In this work, we fill this important gap by exploring robustness properties of neural ODEs both empirically and theoretically. We first present an empirical study on the robustness of the neural ODE-based networks (ODENets) by exposing them to inputs with various types of perturbations and subsequently investigating the changes of the corresponding outputs. In contrast to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we find that the ODENets are more robust against both random Gaussian perturbations and adversarial attack examples. We then provide an insightful understanding of this phenomenon by exploiting a certain desirable property of the flow of a continuous-time ODE, namely that integral curves are non-intersecting. Our work suggests that, due to their intrinsic robustness, it is promising to use neural ODEs as a basic block for building robust deep network models. To further enhance the robustness of vanilla neural ODEs, we propose the time-invariant steady neural ODE (TisODE), which regularizes the flow on perturbed data via the time-invariant property and the imposition of a steady-state constraint. We show that the TisODE method outperforms vanilla neural ODEs and also can work in conjunction with other state-of-the-art architectural methods to build more robust deep networks.
10	Optimal selection of a subset of items from a given set is a hard problem that requires combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we propose a subset selection algorithm that is trainable with gradient based methods yet achieves near optimal performance via submodular optimization. We focus on the task of identifying a relevant set of sentences for claim verification in the context of the FEVER task. Conventional methods for this task look at sentences on their individual merit and thus do not optimize the informativeness of sentences as a set. We show that our proposed method which builds on the idea of unfolding a greedy algorithm into a computational graph allows both interpretability and gradient based training. The proposed differentiable greedy network (DGN) outperforms discrete optimization algorithms as well as other baseline methods in terms of precision and recall.
10	Meta-Learning has achieved great success in few-shot learning. However, the existing meta-learning models have been evidenced to overfit on meta-training tasks when using deeper and wider convolutional neural networks. This means that we cannot improve the meta-generalization performance by merely deepening or widening the networks. To remedy such a deficiency of meta-overfitting, we propose in this paper a sparsity constrained meta-learning approach to learn from meta-training tasks a subnetwork from which first-order optimization methods can quickly converge towards the optimal network in meta-testing tasks. Our theoretical analysis shows the benefit of sparsity for improving the generalization gap of the learned meta-initialization network. We have implemented our approach on top of the widely applied Reptile algorithm assembled with varying network pruning routines including Dense-Sparse-Dense (DSD) and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT). Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets with different over-parameterized deep networks demonstrate that our method can not only effectively ease meta-overfitting but also in many cases improve the meta-generalization performance when applied to few-shot classification tasks.
01	We propose Distributional Concavity (DC) regularization for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a functional gradient-based method that promotes the entropy of the generator distribution and works against mode collapse. Our DC regularization is an easy-to-implement method that can be used in combination with the current state of the art methods like Spectral Normalization and Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty to further improve the performance.We will not only show that our DC regularization can achieve highly competitive results on ILSVRC2012 and CIFAR datasets in terms of Inception score and Fr\'echet inception distance, but also provide a mathematical guarantee that our method  can always increase the entropy of the generator distribution.  We will also show an intimate theoretical connection between our method and the theory of optimal transport.
10	Distributional Semantics Models(DSM) derive word space from linguistic itemsin context. Meaning is obtained by defining a distance measure between vectorscorresponding to lexical entities. Such vectors present several problems. Thiswork concentrates on quality of word embeddings, improvement of word embeddingvectors, applicability of a novel similarity metric used ‚Äòon top‚Äô of theword embeddings. In this paper we provide comparison between two methodsfor post process improvements to the baseline DSM vectors. The counter-fittingmethod which enforces antonymy and synonymy constraints into the Paragramvector space representations recently showed improvement in the vectors‚Äô capabilityfor judging semantic similarity. The second method is our novel RESMmethod applied to GloVe baseline vectors. By applying the hubness reductionmethod, implementing relational knowledge into the model by retrofitting synonymsand providing a new ranking similarity definition RESM that gives maximumweight to the top vector component values we equal the results for the ESLand TOEFL sets in comparison with our calculations using the Paragram and Paragram+ Counter-fitting methods. For SIMLEX-999 gold standard since we cannotuse the RESM the results using GloVe and PPDB are significantly worse comparedto Paragram. Apparently, counter-fitting corrects hubness. The Paragramor our cosine retrofitting method are state-of-the-art results for the SIMLEX-999gold standard. They are 0.2 better for SIMLEX-999 than word2vec with sensede-conflation (that was announced to be state-of the-art method for less reliablegold standards). Apparently relational knowledge and counter-fitting is more importantfor judging semantic similarity than sense determination for words. It is tobe mentioned, though that Paragram hyperparameters are fitted to SIMLEX-999results. The lesson is that many corrections to word embeddings are necessaryand methods with more parameters and hyperparameters perform better.
01	Neural networks trained only to optimize for training accuracy can often be fooled by adversarial examples --- slightly perturbed inputs misclassified with high confidence. Verification of networks enables us to gauge their vulnerability to such adversarial examples. We formulate verification of piecewise-linear neural networks as a mixed integer program. On a representative task of finding minimum adversarial distortions, our verifier is two to three orders of magnitude quicker than the state-of-the-art. We achieve this computational speedup via tight formulations for non-linearities, as well as a novel presolve algorithm that makes full use of all information available. The computational speedup allows us to verify properties on convolutional and residual networks with over 100,000 ReLUs --- several orders of magnitude more than networks previously verified by any complete verifier. In particular, we determine for the first time the exact adversarial accuracy of an MNIST classifier to perturbations with bounded l-‚àû norm Œµ=0.1: for this classifier, we find an adversarial example for 4.38% of samples, and a certificate of robustness to norm-bounded perturbations for the remainder. Across all robust training procedures and network architectures considered, and for both the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we are able to certify more samples than the state-of-the-art and find more adversarial examples than a strong first-order attack.
10	Abstract In this work, we describe a set of rules for the design and initialization of well-conditioned neural networks, guided by the goal of naturally balancing the diagonal blocks of the Hessian at the start of training. We show how our measure of conditioning of a block relates to another natural measure of conditioning, the ratio of weight gradients to the weights. We prove that for a ReLU-based deep multilayer perceptron, a simple initialization scheme using the geometric mean of the fan-in and fan-out satisfies our scaling rule. For more sophisticated architectures, we show how our scaling principle can be used to guide design choices to produce well-conditioned neural networks, reducing guess-work.
01	"Min-max formulations have attracted great attention in the ML community due to the rise of deep generative models and adversarial methods, while understanding the dynamics of gradient algorithms for solving such formulations has remained a grand challenge. As a first step, we restrict to bilinear zero-sum games and give a systematic analysis of popular gradient updates, for both simultaneous and alternating versions. We provide exact conditions for their convergence and find the optimal parameter setup and convergence rates. In particular, our results offer formal evidence that alternating updates converge ""better"" than simultaneous ones."
10	We propose to tackle a time series regression problem by computing temporal evolution of a probability density function to provide a probabilistic forecast. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based model is employed to learn a nonlinear operator for temporal evolution of a probability density function. We use a softmax layer for a numerical discretization of a smooth probability density functions, which transforms a function approximation problem to a classification task. Explicit and implicit regularization strategies are introduced to impose a smoothness condition on the estimated probability distribution. A Monte Carlo procedure to compute the temporal evolution of the distribution for a multiple-step forecast is presented. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm on three synthetic and two real data sets shows advantage over the compared baselines.
01	Traditional set prediction models can struggle with simple datasets due to an issue we call the responsibility problem. We introduce a pooling method for sets of feature vectors based on sorting features across elements of the set. This can be used to construct a permutation-equivariant auto-encoder that avoids this responsibility problem. On a toy dataset of polygons and a set version of MNIST, we show that such an auto-encoder produces considerably better reconstructions and representations. Replacing the pooling function in existing set encoders with FSPool improves accuracy and convergence speed on a variety of datasets.
10	Exploration bonuses derived from the novelty of observations in an environment have become a popular approach to motivate exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the past few years. Recent methods such as curiosity-driven exploration usually estimate the novelty of new observations by the prediction errors of their system dynamics models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of optical flow estimation from the field of computer vision to the RL domain and utilize the errors from optical flow estimation to evaluate the novelty of new observations.  We introduce a flow-based intrinsic curiosity module (FICM) capable of learning the motion features and understanding the observations in a more comprehensive and efficient fashion. We evaluate our method and compare it with a number of baselines on several benchmark environments, including Atari games, Super Mario Bros., and ViZDoom. Our results show that the proposed method is superior to the baselines in certain environments, especially for those featuring sophisticated moving patterns or with high-dimensional observation spaces.
01	"To backpropagate the gradients through stochastic binary layers, we propose the augment-REINFORCE-merge (ARM) estimator that is unbiased, exhibits low variance, and has low computational complexity. Exploiting variable augmentation, REINFORCE, and reparameterization, the ARM estimator achieves adaptive variance reduction for Monte Carlo integration by merging two expectations via common random numbers. The variance-reduction mechanism of the ARM estimator can also be attributed to either antithetic sampling in an augmented space, or the use of an optimal anti-symmetric ""self-control"" baseline function together with the REINFORCE estimator in that augmented space. Experimental results show the ARM estimator provides state-of-the-art performance in auto-encoding variational inference and maximum likelihood estimation, for discrete latent variable models with one or multiple stochastic binary layers. Python code for reproducible research is publicly available."
10	In this paper, we explore \textit{summary-to-article generation}: the task of generating long articles given a short summary, which provides finer-grained content control for the generated text. To prevent sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models from degenerating into language models and better controlling the long text to be generated, we propose a hierarchical generation approach which first generates a sketch of intermediate length based on the summary and then completes the article by enriching the generated sketch. To mitigate the discrepancy between the ``oracle'' sketch used during training and the noisy sketch generated during inference, we propose an end-to-end joint training framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. For evaluation, we use text summarization corpora by reversing their inputs and outputs, and introduce a novel evaluation method that employs a summarization system to summarize the generated article and test its match with the original input summary. Experiments show that our proposed hierarchical generation approach can generate a coherent and relevant article based on the given summary, yielding significant improvements upon conventional seq2seq models. 
01	Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to facilitate the design of deep networks for new tasks. Existing techniques rely on two stages: searching over the architecture space and validating the best architecture. NAS algorithms are currently compared solely based on their results on the downstream task. While intuitive, this fails to explicitly evaluate the effectiveness of their search strategies. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the NAS search phase.To this end, we compare the quality of the solutions obtained by NAS search policies with that of random architecture selection. We find that: (i) On average, the state-of-the-art NAS algorithms perform similarly to the random policy; (ii) the widely-used weight sharing strategy degrades the ranking of the NAS candidates to the point of not reflecting their true performance, thus reducing the effectiveness of the search process.We believe that our evaluation framework will be key to designing NAS strategies that consistently discover architectures superior to random ones.
10	The celebrated Sequence to Sequence learning (Seq2Seq) technique and its numerous variants achieve excellent performance on many tasks. However, many machine learning tasks have inputs naturally represented as graphs; existing Seq2Seq models face a significant challenge in achieving accurate conversion from graph form to the appropriate sequence. To address this challenge, we introduce a general end-to-end graph-to-sequence neural encoder-decoder architecture that maps an input graph to a sequence of vectors and uses an attention-based LSTM method to decode the target sequence from these vectors. Our method first generates the node and graph embeddings using an improved graph-based neural network with a novel aggregation strategy to incorporate edge direction information in the node embeddings. We further introduce an attention mechanism that aligns node embeddings and the decoding sequence to better cope with large graphs. Experimental results on bAbI, Shortest Path, and Natural Language Generation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing graph neural networks, Seq2Seq, and Tree2Seq models; using the proposed bi-directional node embedding aggregation strategy, the model can converge rapidly to the optimal performance.
10	Imitation learning has emerged as a powerful strategy for learning initial policies that can be refined with reinforcement learning techniques. Most strategies in imitation learning, however, rely on per-step supervision either from expert demonstrations, referred to as behavioral cloning or from interactive expert policy queries such as DAgger. These strategies differ on the state distribution at which the expert actions are collected -- the former using the state distribution of the expert, the latter using the state distribution of the policy being trained. However, the learning signal in both cases arises from the expert actions. On the other end of the spectrum, approaches rooted in Policy Iteration, such as Dual Policy Iteration do not choose next step actions based on an expert, but instead use planning or search over the policy to choose an action distribution to train towards. However, this can be computationally expensive, and can also end up training the policy on a state distribution that is far from the current policy's induced distribution. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that finds a middle ground by using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform local trajectory improvement over rollouts from the policy. We provide theoretical justification for both the proposed local trajectory search algorithm and for our use of MCTS as a local policy improvement operator. We also show empirically that our method (Policy Optimization by Local Improvement through Search or POLISH) is much faster than methods that plan globally, speeding up training by a factor of up to 14 in wall clock time. Furthermore, the resulting policy outperforms strong baselines in both reinforcement learning and imitation learning.
10	Quantizing large Neural Networks (NN) while maintaining the performance is highly desirable for resource-limited devices due to reduced memory and time complexity. NN quantization is usually formulated as a constrained optimization problem and optimized via a modified version of gradient descent. In this work, by interpreting the continuous parameters (unconstrained) as the dual of the quantized ones, we introduce a Mirror Descent (MD) framework (Bubeck (2015)) for NN quantization. Specifically, we provide conditions on the projections (i.e., mapping from continuous to quantized ones) which would enable us to derive valid mirror maps and in turn the respective MD updates. Furthermore, we discuss a numerically stable implementation of MD by storing an additional set of auxiliary dual variables (continuous). This update is strikingly analogous to the popular Straight Through Estimator (STE) based method which is typically viewed as a ‚Äútrick‚Äù to avoid vanishing gradients issue but here we show that it is an implementation method for MD for certain projections. Our experiments on standard classification datasets (CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet) with convolutional and residual architectures show that our MD variants obtain fully-quantized networks with accuracies very close to the floating-point networks.
10	Weight-sharing plays a significant role in the success of many deep neural networks, by increasing memory efficiency and incorporating useful inductive priors about the problem into the network. But understanding how weight-sharing can be used effectively in general is a topic that has not been studied extensively. Chen et al. (2015) proposed HashedNets, which augments a multi-layer perceptron with a hash table, as a method for neural network compression. We generalize this method into a framework (ArbNets) that allows for efficient arbitrary weight-sharing, and use it to study the role of weight-sharing in neural networks. We show that common neural networks can be expressed as ArbNets with different hash functions. We also present two novel hash functions, the Dirichlet hash and the Neighborhood hash, and use them to demonstrate experimentally that balanced and deterministic weight-sharing helps with the performance of a neural network.
10	MixUp is a data augmentation scheme in which pairs of training samples and their corresponding labels are mixed using linear coefficients. Without label mixing, MixUp becomes a more conventional scheme: input samples are moved but their original labels are retained. Because samples are preferentially moved in the direction of other classes \iffalse -- which are typically clustered in input space -- \fi we refer to this method as directional adversarial training, or DAT. We show that under two mild conditions, MixUp asymptotically convergences to a subset of DAT. We define untied MixUp (UMixUp), a superset of MixUp wherein training labels are mixed with different linear coefficients to those of their corresponding samples. We show that under the same mild conditions, untied MixUp converges to the entire class of DAT schemes. Motivated by the understanding that UMixUp is both a generalization of MixUp and a form of adversarial training, we experiment with different datasets and loss functions to show that UMixUp provides improved performance over MixUp. In short, we present a novel interpretation of MixUp as belonging to a class highly analogous to adversarial training, and on this basis we introduce a simple generalization which outperforms MixUp.
01	We propose a novel node embedding of directed graphs to statistical manifolds, which is based on a global minimization of pairwise relative entropy and graph geodesics in a non-linear way. Each node is encoded with a probability density function over a measurable space. Furthermore, we analyze the connection of the geometrical properties of such embedding and their efficient learning procedure. Extensive experiments show that our proposed embedding is better preserving the global geodesic information of graphs, as well as outperforming existing embedding models on directed graphs in a variety of evaluation metrics, in an unsupervised setting.
01	Incorporating hierarchical structures like constituency trees has been shown to be effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, it is evident that state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-based models like the Transformer struggle to encode such structures inherently. On the other hand, dedicated models like the Tree-LSTM, while explicitly modeling hierarchical structures, do not perform as efficiently as the Transformer. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap with Hierarchical Accumulation to encode parse tree structures into self-attention at constant time complexity. Our approach outperforms SOTA methods in four IWSLT translation tasks and the WMT'14 English-German task. It also yields improvements over Transformer and Tree-LSTM on three text classification tasks. We further demonstrate that using hierarchical priors can compensate for data shortage, and that our model prefers phrase-level attentions over token-level attentions.
10	Compressing deep neural networks (DNNs) is important for real-world applications operating on resource-constrained devices. However, it is difficult to change the model size once the training is completed, which needs re-training to configure models suitable for different devices. In this paper, we propose a novel method that enables DNNs to flexibly change their size after training. We factorize the weight matrices of the DNNs via singular value decomposition (SVD) and change their ranks according to the target size. In contrast with existing methods, we introduce simple criteria that characterize the importance of each basis and layer, which enables to effectively compress the error and complexity of models as little as possible. In experiments on multiple image-classification tasks, our method exhibits favorable performance compared with other methods.
10	Long training times of deep neural networks are a bottleneck in machine learning research. The major impediment to fast training is the quadratic growth of both memory and compute requirements of dense and convolutional layers with respect to their information bandwidth. Recently, training `a priori' sparse networks has been proposed as a method for allowing layers to retain high information bandwidth, while keeping memory and compute low. However, the choice of which sparse topology should be used in these networks is unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical foundation for the choice of intra-layer topology. First, we derive a new sparse neural network initialization scheme that allows us to explore the space of very deep sparse networks. Next, we evaluate several topologies and show that seemingly similar topologies can often have a large difference in attainable accuracy. To explain these differences, we develop a data-free heuristic that can evaluate a topology independently from the dataset the network will be trained on. We then derive a set of requirements that make a good topology, and arrive at a single topology that satisfies all of them. 
01	We present CROSSGRAD , a method to use multi-domain training data to learn a classifier that generalizes to new domains. CROSSGRAD does not need an adaptation phase via labeled or unlabeled data, or domain features in the new domain. Most existing domain adaptation methods attempt to erase domain signals using techniques like domain adversarial training. In contrast, CROSSGRAD is free to use domain signals for predicting labels, if it can prevent overfitting on training domains. We conceptualize the task in a Bayesian setting, in which a sampling step is implemented as data augmentation, based on domain-guided perturbations of input instances. CROSSGRAD jointly trains a label and a domain classifier on examples perturbed by loss gradients of each other‚Äôs objectives. This enables us to directly perturb inputs, without separating and re-mixing domain signals while making various distributional assumptions. Empirical evaluation on three different applications where this setting is natural establishes that (1) domain-guided perturbation provides consistently better generalization to unseen domains, compared to generic instance perturbation methods, and (2) data augmentation is a more stable and accurate method than domain adversarial training.
01	Adversarial learning methods have been proposed for a wide range of applications, but the training of adversarial models can be notoriously unstable. Effectively balancing the performance of the generator and discriminator is critical, since a discriminator that achieves very high accuracy will produce relatively uninformative gradients. In this work, we propose a simple and general technique to constrain information flow in the discriminator by means of an information bottleneck. By enforcing a constraint on the mutual information between the observations and the discriminator's internal representation, we can effectively modulate the discriminator's accuracy and maintain useful and informative gradients. We demonstrate that our proposed variational discriminator bottleneck (VDB) leads to significant improvements across three distinct application areas for adversarial learning algorithms. Our primary evaluation studies the applicability of the VDB to imitation learning of dynamic continuous control skills, such as running. We show that our method can learn such skills directly from raw video demonstrations, substantially outperforming prior adversarial imitation learning methods. The VDB can also be combined with adversarial inverse reinforcement learning to learn parsimonious reward functions that can be transferred and re-optimized in new settings. Finally, we demonstrate that VDB can train GANs more effectively for image generation, improving upon a number of prior stabilization methods.
01	Distributed optimization is vital in solving large-scale machine learning problems. A widely-shared feature of distributed optimization techniques is the requirement that all nodes complete their assigned tasks in each computational epoch before the system can proceed to the next epoch. In such settings, slow nodes, called stragglers, can greatly slow progress. To mitigate the impact of stragglers, we propose an online distributed optimization method called Anytime Minibatch. In this approach, all nodes are given a fixed time to compute the gradients of as many data samples as possible. The result is a variable per-node minibatch size. Workers then get a fixed communication time to average their minibatch gradients via several rounds of consensus, which are then used to update primal variables via dual averaging. Anytime Minibatch prevents stragglers from holding up the system without wasting the work that stragglers can complete. We present a convergence analysis and analyze the wall time performance. Our numerical results show that our approach is up to 1.5 times faster in Amazon EC2 and it is up to five times faster when there is greater variability in compute node performance.
10	While deep neural networks (NNs) do not provide the confidence of its prediction, Bayesian neural network (BNN) can estimate the uncertainty of the  prediction. However, BNNs have not been widely used in practice due to the computational cost of predictive inference. This prohibitive computational cost is a hindrance especially when processing stream data with low-latency. To address this problem, we propose a novel model which approximate BNNs for data streams. Instead of generating separate prediction for each data sample independently, this model estimates the increments of prediction for a new data sample from the previous predictions. The computational cost of this model is almost the same as that of non-Bayesian deep NNs. Experiments including semantic segmentation on real-world data show that this model performs significantly faster than BNNs, estimating uncertainty comparable to the results of BNNs.
01	"The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular combination of deep latent variable model and accompanying variational learning technique. By using a neural inference network to approximate the model's posterior on latent variables, VAEs efficiently parameterize a lower bound on marginal data likelihood that can be optimized directly via gradient methods. In practice, however, VAE training often results in a degenerate local optimum known as ""posterior collapse"" where the model learns to ignore the latent variable and the approximate posterior mimics the prior. In this paper, we investigate posterior collapse from the perspective of training dynamics. We find that during the initial stages of training the inference network fails to approximate the model's true posterior, which is a moving target. As a result, the model is encouraged to ignore the latent encoding and posterior collapse occurs. Based on this observation, we propose an extremely simple modification to VAE training to reduce inference lag: depending on the model's current mutual information between latent variable and observation, we aggressively optimize the inference network before performing each model update. Despite introducing neither new model components nor significant complexity over basic VAE, our approach is able to avoid the problem of collapse that has plagued a large amount of previous work. Empirically, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines on text and image benchmarks in terms of held-out likelihood, and is competitive with more complex techniques for avoiding collapse while being substantially faster."
10	The vulnerability to slight input perturbations is a worrying yet intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs). Though some efforts have been devoted to investigating the reason behind such adversarial behavior, the relation between standard accuracy and adversarial behavior of DNNs is still little understood. In this work, we reveal such relation by first introducing a metric characterizing the standard performance of DNNs. Then we theoretically show this metric can be disentangled into an information-theoretic non-robust component that is related to adversarial behavior, and a robust component. Then, we show by experiments that DNNs under standard training rely heavily on optimizing the non-robust component in achieving decent performance. We also demonstrate current state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms indeed try to robustify DNNs by preventing them from using the non-robust component to distinguish samples from different categories. Based on our findings, we take a step forward and point out the possible direction of simultaneously achieving decent standard generalization and adversarial robustness. It is hoped that our theory can further inspire the community to make more interesting discoveries about the relation between standard accuracy and adversarial robustness of DNNs.
10	This paper studies aligning knowledge graphs from different sources or languages. Most existing methods train supervised methods for the alignment, which usually require a large number of aligned knowledge triplets. However, such a large number of aligned knowledge triplets may not be available or are expensive to obtain in many domains. Therefore, in this paper we propose to study aligning knowledge graphs in fully-unsupervised or weakly-supervised fashion, i.e., without or with only a few aligned triplets. We propose an unsupervised framework to align the entity and relation embddings of different knowledge graphs with an adversarial learning framework. Moreover, a regularization term which maximizes the mutual information between the embeddings of different knowledge graphs is used to mitigate the problem of mode collapse when learning the alignment functions. Such a framework can be further seamlessly integrated with existing supervised methods by utilizing a limited number of aligned triples as guidance. Experimental results on multiple datasets prove the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both the unsupervised and the weakly-supervised settings.
01	Adapting deep networks to new concepts from a few examples is challenging, due to the high computational requirements of standard fine-tuning procedures.Most work on few-shot learning has thus focused on simple learning techniques for adaptation, such as nearest neighbours or gradient descent.Nonetheless, the machine learning literature contains a wealth of methods that learn non-deep models very efficiently.In this paper, we propose to use these fast convergent methods as the main adaptation mechanism for few-shot learning.The main idea is to teach a deep network to use standard machine learning tools, such as ridge regression, as part of its own internal model, enabling it to quickly adapt to novel data.This requires back-propagating errors through the solver steps.While normally the cost of the matrix operations involved in such a process would be significant, by using the Woodbury identity we can make the small number of examples work to our advantage.We propose both closed-form and iterative solvers, based on ridge regression and logistic regression components.Our methods constitute a simple and novel approach to the problem of few-shot learning and achieve performance competitive with or superior to the state of the art on three benchmarks.
10	We introduce a unified probabilistic approach for deep continual learning based on variational Bayesian inference with open set recognition. Our model combines a joint probabilistic encoder with a generative model and a linear classifier that get shared across tasks. The open set recognition bounds the approximate posterior by fitting regions of high density on the basis of correctly classified data points and balances open set detection with recognition errors. Catastrophic forgetting is significantly alleviated through generative replay, where the open set recognition is used to sample from high density areas of the class specific posterior and reject statistical outliers. Our approach naturally allows for forward and backward transfer while maintaining past knowledge without the necessity of storing old data, regularization or inferring task labels. We demonstrate compelling results in the challenging scenario of incrementally expanding the single-head classifier for both class incremental visual and audio classification tasks, as well as incremental learning of datasets across modalities.
10	Efficient exploration plays a key role in reinforcement learning tasks. Commonly used dithering strategies, such as-greedy, try to explore the action-state space randomly; this can lead to large demand for samples. In this paper, We propose an exploration method based on the uncertainty in reward space. There are two policies in this approach, the exploration policy is used for exploratory sampling in the environment, then the benchmark policy try to update by the data proven by the exploration policy. Benchmark policy is used to provide the uncertainty in reward space, e.g. td-error, which guides the exploration policy updating. We apply our method on two grid-world environments and four Atari games. Experiment results show that our method improves learning speed and have a better performance than baseline policies
10	Conversational question answering (CQA) is a novel QA task that requires the understanding of dialogue context. Different from traditional single-turn machine reading comprehension (MRC), CQA is a comprehensive task comprised of passage reading, coreference resolution, and contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose an innovative contextualized attention-based deep neural network, SDNet, to fuse context into traditional MRC models. Our model leverages both inter-attention and self-attention to comprehend the conversation and passage. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel method to integrate the BERT contextual model as a sub-module in our network. Empirical results show the effectiveness of SDNet. On the CoQA leaderboard, it outperforms the previous best model's F1 score by 1.6%. Our ensemble model further improves the F1 score by 2.7%.
10	This paper introduces the task of semantic instance completion: from an incomplete RGB-D scan of a scene, we aim to detect the individual object instances comprising the scene and infer their complete object geometry. This enables a semantically meaningful decomposition of a scanned scene into individual, complete 3D objects, including hidden and unobserved object parts. This will open up new possibilities for interactions with object in a scene, for instance for virtual or robotic agents. To address this task, we propose 3D-SIC, a new data-driven approach that jointly detects object instances and predicts their completed geometry. The core idea of 3D-SIC is a novel end-to-end 3D neural network architecture that leverages joint color and geometry feature learning. The fully-convolutional nature of our 3D network enables efficient inference of semantic instance completion for 3D scans at scale of large indoor environments in a single forward pass. In a series evaluation, we evaluate on both real and synthetic scan benchmark data, where we outperform state-of-the-art approaches by over 15 in mAP@0.5 on ScanNet, and over 18 in mAP@0.5 on SUNCG.
01	This paper concerns dictionary learning, i.e., sparse coding, a fundamental representation learning problem. We show that a subgradient descent algorithm, with random initialization, can recover orthogonal dictionaries on a natural nonsmooth, nonconvex L1 minimization formulation of the problem, under mild statistical assumption on the data. This is in contrast to previous provable methods that require either expensive computation or delicate initialization schemes. Our analysis develops several tools for characterizing landscapes of nonsmooth functions, which might be of independent interest for provable training of deep networks with nonsmooth activations (e.g., ReLU), among other applications. Preliminary synthetic and real experiments corroborate our analysis and show that our algorithm works well empirically in recovering orthogonal dictionaries.
10	Interpretability methods often measure the contribution of an input feature to an image classifier's decisions by heuristically removing it via e.g. blurring, adding noise, or graying out, which often produce unrealistic, out-of-samples. Instead, we propose to integrate a generative inpainter into three representative attribution map methods as a mechanism for removing input features. Compared to the original counterparts, our methods (1) generate more plausible counterfactual samples under the true data generating process; (2) are more robust to hyperparameter settings; and (3) localize objects more accurately. Our findings were consistent across both ImageNet and Places365 datasets and two different pairs of classifiers and inpainters.
10	We propose learning to transfer learn (L2TL) to improve transfer learning on a target dataset by judicious extraction of information from a source dataset. L2TL considers joint optimization of vastly-shared weights between models for source and target tasks, and employs adaptive weights for scaling of constituent losses. The adaptation of the weights is based on reinforcement learning, guided with a performance metric on the target validation set. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of L2TL given fixed models, consistently outperforming fine-tuning baselines on various datasets. In the regimes of small-scale target datasets and significant label mismatch between source and target datasets, L2TL outperforms previous work by an even larger margin. 
01	"We study the landscape of squared loss in neural networks with one-hidden layer and ReLU activation functions.  Let $m$ and $d$ be the widths of hidden and input layers, respectively. We show that there exist poor local minima with positive curvature for some training sets of size $n\geq m+2d-2$. By positive curvature of a local minimum, we mean that within a small neighborhood the loss function is strictly increasing in all directions. Consequently, for such training sets, there are initialization of weights from which there is no descent path to global optima. It is known that for $n\le m$, there always exist descent paths to global optima from all initial weights. In this perspective, our results provide a somewhat sharp characterization of the over-parameterization required for ""existence of descent paths"" in the loss landscape. "
10	Numerous machine reading comprehension (MRC) datasets often involve manual annotation, requiring enormous human effort, and hence the size of the dataset remains significantly smaller than the size of the data available for unsupervised learning. Recently, researchers proposed a model for generating synthetic question-and-answer data from large corpora such as Wikipedia. This model is utilized to generate synthetic data for training an MRC model before fine-tuning it using the original MRC dataset. This technique shows better performance than other general pre-training techniques such as language modeling, because the characteristics of the generated data are similar to those of the downstream MRC data. However, it is difficult to have high-quality synthetic data comparable to human-annotated MRC datasets. To address this issue, we propose Answer-containing Sentence Generation (ASGen), a novel pre-training method for generating synthetic data involving two advanced techniques, (1) dynamically determining K answers and (2) pre-training the question generator on the answer-containing sentence generation task. We evaluate the question generation capability of our method by comparing the BLEU score with existing methods and test our method by fine-tuning the MRC model on the downstream MRC data after training on synthetic data. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing generation methods and increases the performance of the state-of-the-art MRC models across a range of MRC datasets such as SQuAD-v1.1, SQuAD-v2.0, KorQuAD and QUASAR-T without any architectural modifications to the original MRC model.
10	We investigate the capacity control provided by dropout in various machine learning problems. First, we study dropout for matrix sensing, where it induces a data-dependent regularizer that, in expectation, equals the weighted trace-norm of the product of the factors. In deep learning, we show that the data-dependent regularizer due to dropout directly controls the Rademacher complexity of the underlying class of deep neural networks. These developments enable us to give concrete generalization error bounds for the dropout algorithm in both matrix completion as well as training deep neural networks. We evaluate our theoretical findings on real-world datasets, including MovieLens, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10.
10	There has been an ongoing cycle where stronger detection mechanisms and defenses against adversarial attacks are subsequently broken by a more advanced defense-aware attack. We present a new approach, which we argue is a step towards ending this cycle by deflecting adversarial attacks, i.e., by forcing the attacker to produce an input which semantically resembles the attack's target class. To this end, we first propose a stronger defense mechanism based on capsule networks which combines three detection mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art detection performance on both standard and defense-aware attacks. We then show that undetected attacks against our defense are often classified as the adversarial target class by performing a human study where participants are asked to label the class of images produced by the attack. These attack images thus can no longer be called adversarial, as our network classifies them the same way as humans do.
10	We develop a novel and efficient algorithm for optimizing neural networks inspired by a recently proposed geodesic optimization algorithm. Our algorithm, which we call Stochastic  Geodesic Optimization (SGeO), utilizes an adaptive coefficient on top of Polyak's Heavy Ball method effectively controlling the amount of weight put on the previous update to the parameters based on the change of direction in the optimization path. Experimental results on strongly convex functions with Lipschitz gradients and deep Autoencoder benchmarks show that SGeO reaches lower errors than established first-order methods and competes well with lower or similar errors to a recent second-order method called K-FAC (Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature). We also incorporate Nesterov style lookahead gradient into our algorithm (SGeO-N) and observe notable improvements. 
01	We propose Stochastic Neural Architecture Search (SNAS), an economical end-to-end solution to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that trains neural operation parameters and architecture distribution parameters in same round of back-propagation, while maintaining the completeness and differentiability of the NAS pipeline. In this work, NAS is reformulated as an optimization problem on parameters of a joint distribution for the search space in a cell. To leverage the gradient information in generic differentiable loss for architecture search, a novel search gradient is proposed. We prove that this search gradient optimizes the same objective as reinforcement-learning-based NAS, but assigns credits to structural decisions more efficiently. This credit assignment is further augmented with locally decomposable reward to enforce a resource-efficient constraint. In experiments on CIFAR-10, SNAS takes less epochs to find a cell architecture with state-of-the-art accuracy than non-differentiable evolution-based and reinforcement-learning-based NAS, which is also transferable to ImageNet. It is also shown that child networks of SNAS can maintain the validation accuracy in searching, with which attention-based NAS requires parameter retraining to compete, exhibiting potentials to stride towards efficient NAS on big datasets.
10	Effective performance of neural networks depends critically on effective tuning of optimization hyperparameters, especially learning rates (and schedules thereof). We present Amortized Proximal Optimization (APO), which takes the perspective that each optimization step should approximately minimize a proximal objective (similar to the ones used to motivate natural gradient and trust region policy optimization). Optimization hyperparameters are adapted to best minimize the proximal objective after one weight update. We show that an idealized version of APO (where an oracle minimizes the proximal objective exactly) achieves global convergence to stationary point and locally second-order convergence to global optimum for neural networks. APO incurs minimal computational overhead. We experiment with using APO to adapt a variety of optimization hyperparameters online during training, including (possibly layer-specific) learning rates, damping coefficients, and gradient variance exponents. For a variety of network architectures and optimization algorithms (including SGD, RMSprop, and K-FAC), we show that with minimal tuning, APO performs competitively with carefully tuned optimizers.
10	Network compression technology can compress large and complex networks into small networks, so that it can be deployed on devices with limited resources. Sparse regularization method, such as $\normlone$ or $L^{21}$ regularization, is the most popular method that can induce sparse model. However, it introduces new hyperparameters, which not only affects the degree of sparsity, but also involves whether the network can be effectively trained (gradient explosion or model non-convergence). How to select hyperparameters becomes an important and open problem for regularization-based network compression method. In this paper, we propose an auto network compression framework with cross-validation gradient which can automatically adjust the hyperparameters. Firstly, we design an unified framework which combines model parameter learning with hyperparametric learning. Secondly, in order to solve the problem of non-derivability of $\normlone$ norm, we introduce auxiliary variables to transform it into a solvable problem, and then obtain the derivative of model parameters with respect to hyperparameters. Finally, the derivative of the hyperparametric vector is solved by the chain rule. In solving the inverse problem of Heisen matrix, we compare three methods and only calculate the mixed partial derivatives. To a certain extent, this method realizes the automatic network compression. Classical network structures such as VGG, ResNet and DensNet are tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to prove the effectiveness of our algorithm.
01	"The family of feedback alignment (FA) algorithms aims to provide a more biologically motivated alternative to backpropagation (BP), by substituting the computations that are unrealistic to be implemented in physical brains.While FA algorithms have been shown to work well in practice, there is a lack of rigorous theory proofing their learning capabilities.		Here we introduce the first feedback alignment algorithm with provable learning guarantees. In contrast to existing work, we do not require any assumption about the size or depth of the network except that it has a single output neuron, i.e., such as for binary classification tasks.We show that our FA algorithm can deliver its theoretical promises in practice, surpassing the learning performance of existing FA methods and matching backpropagation in binary classification tasks.Finally, we demonstrate the limits of our FA variant when the number of output neurons grows beyond a certain quantity."
01	Transfer and adaptation to new unknown environmental dynamics is a key challenge for reinforcement learning (RL). An even greater challenge is performing near-optimally in a single attempt at test time, possibly without access to dense rewards, which is not addressed by current methods that require multiple experience rollouts for adaptation. To achieve single episode transfer in a family of environments with related dynamics, we propose a general algorithm that optimizes a probe and an inference model to rapidly estimate underlying latent variables of test dynamics, which are then immediately used as input to a universal control policy. This modular approach enables integration of state-of-the-art algorithms for variational inference or RL. Moreover, our approach does not require access to rewards at test time, allowing it to perform in settings where existing adaptive approaches cannot. In diverse experimental domains with a single episode test constraint, our method significantly outperforms existing adaptive approaches and shows favorable performance against baselines for robust transfer.
01	A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is environment generalization: a policy trained to solve a task in one environment often fails to solve the same task in a slightly different test environment. A common approach to improve inter-environment transfer is to learn policies that are invariant to the distribution of testing environments. However, we argue that instead of being invariant, the policy should identify the specific nuances of an environment and exploit them to achieve better performance. In this work, we propose the ‚ÄúEnvironment-Probing‚Äù Interaction (EPI) policy, a policy that probes a new environment to extract an implicit understanding of that environment‚Äôs behavior. Once this environment-specific information is obtained, it is used as an additional input to a task-specific policy that can now perform environment-conditioned actions to solve a task. To learn these EPI-policies, we present a reward function based on transition predictability. Specifically, a higher reward is given if the trajectory generated by the EPI-policy can be used to better predict transitions. We experimentally show that EPI-conditioned task-specific policies significantly outperform commonly used policy generalization methods on novel testing environments.
01	Within many machine learning algorithms, a fundamental problem concerns efficient calculation of an unbiased gradient wrt parameters $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ for expectation-based objectives $\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} (\boldsymbol{y})} [f (\boldsymbol{y}) ]$. Most existing methods either ($i$) suffer from high variance, seeking help from (often) complicated variance-reduction techniques; or ($ii$) they only apply to reparameterizable continuous random variables and employ a reparameterization trick. To address these limitations, we propose a General and One-sample (GO) gradient that ($i$) applies to many distributions associated with non-reparameterizable continuous {\em or} discrete random variables, and ($ii$) has the same low-variance as the reparameterization trick. We find that the GO gradient often works well in practice based on only one Monte Carlo sample (although one can of course use more samples if desired). Alongside the GO gradient, we develop a means of propagating the chain rule through distributions, yielding statistical back-propagation, coupling neural networks to common random variables.
01	In recent years several adversarial attacks and defenses have been proposed. Often seemingly robust models turn out to be non-robust when more sophisticated attacks are used. One way out of this dilemma are provable robustness guarantees. While provably robust models for specific $l_p$-perturbation models have been developed, we show that they do not come with any guarantee against other $l_q$-perturbations. We propose a new regularization scheme, MMR-Universal, for ReLU networks which enforces robustness wrt $l_1$- \textit{and} $l_\infty$-perturbations and show how that leads to the first provably robust models wrt any $l_p$-norm for $p\geq 1$.
10	Recently various neural networks have been proposed for irregularly structured data such as graphs and manifolds. To our knowledge, all existing graph networks have discrete depth. Inspired by neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) for data in the Euclidean domain, we extend the idea of continuous-depth models to graph data, and propose graph ordinary differential equation (GODE). The derivative of hidden node states are parameterized with a graph neural network, and the output states are the solution to this ordinary differential equation. We demonstrate two end-to-end methods for efficient training of GODE: (1) indirect back-propagation with the adjoint method; (2) direct back-propagation through the ODE solver, which accurately computes the gradient. We demonstrate that direct backprop outperforms the adjoint method in experiments. We then introduce a family of bijective blocks, which enables $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory consumption. We demonstrate that GODE can be easily adapted to different existing graph neural networks and improve accuracy. We validate the performance of GODE in both semi-supervised node classification tasks and graph classification tasks. Our GODE model achieves a continuous model in time, memory efficiency, accurate gradient estimation, and generalizability with different graph networks.
10	3D objects (artefacts) are made to fulfill functions. Designing an object often starts with defining a list of functionalities that it should provide, also known as functional requirements. Today, the design of 3D object models is still a slow and largely artisanal activity, with few Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools existing to aid the exploration of the design solution space. The purpose of the study is to explore the possibility of shape generation conditioned on desired functionalities. To accelerate the design process, we introduce an algorithm for generating object shapes with desired functionalities. We follow the principle form follows function, and assume that the form of a structure is correlated to its function. First, we use an artificial neural network to learn a function-to-form mapping by analysing a dataset of objects labeled with their functionalities. Then, we combine forms providing one or more desired functions, generating an object shape that is expected to provide all of them. Finally, we verify in simulation whether the generated object possesses the desired functionalities, by defining and executing functionality tests on it.
10	Many notions of fairness may be expressed as linear constraints, and the resulting constrained objective is often optimized by transforming the problem into its Lagrangian dual with additive linear penalties. In non-convex settings, the resulting problem may be difficult to solve as the Lagrangian is not guaranteed to have a deterministic saddle-point equilibrium.  In this paper, we propose to modify the linear penalties to second-order ones, and we argue that this results in a more practical training procedure in non-convex, large-data settings. For one, the use of second-order penalties allows training the penalized objective with a fixed value of the penalty coefficient, thus avoiding the instability and potential lack of convergence associated with two-player min-max games. Secondly, we derive a method for efficiently computing the gradients associated with the second-order penalties in stochastic mini-batch settings. Our resulting algorithm performs well empirically, learning an appropriately fair classifier on a number of standard benchmarks.
01	Neuromorphic hardware tends to pose limits on the connectivity of deep networks that one can run on them. But also generic hardware and software implementations of deep learning run more efficiently for sparse networks. Several methods exist for pruning connections of a neural network after it was trained without connectivity constraints. We present an algorithm, DEEP R, that enables us to train directly a sparsely connected neural network. DEEP R automatically rewires the network during supervised training so that connections are there where they are most needed for the task, while its total number is all the time strictly bounded. We demonstrate that DEEP R can be used to train very sparse feedforward and recurrent neural networks on standard benchmark tasks with just a minor loss in performance. DEEP R is based on a rigorous theoretical foundation that views rewiring as stochastic sampling of network configurations from a posterior.
10	Neural architecture search (NAS), the task of finding neural architectures automatically, has recently emerged as a promising approach for unveiling better models over human-designed ones. However, most success stories are for vision tasks and have been quite limited for text, except for a small language modeling setup. In this paper, we explore NAS for text sequences at scale, by first focusing on the task of language translation and later extending to reading comprehension. From a standard sequence-to-sequence models for translation, we conduct extensive searches over the recurrent cells and attention similarity functions across two translation tasks, IWSLT English-Vietnamese and WMT German-English. We report challenges in performing cell searches as well as demonstrate initial success on attention searches with translation improvements over strong baselines. In addition, we show that results on attention searches are transferable to reading comprehension on the SQuAD dataset.
01	Ensembles, where multiple neural networks are trained individually and their predictions are averaged, have been shown to be widely successful for improving both the accuracy and predictive uncertainty of single neural networks. However, an ensemble‚Äôs cost for both training and testing increases linearly with the number of networks, which quickly becomes untenable.In this paper, we propose BatchEnsemble, an ensemble method whose computational and memory costs are significantly lower than typical ensembles. BatchEnsemble achieves this by defining each weight matrix to be the Hadamard product of a shared weight among all ensemble members and a rank-one matrix per member. Unlike ensembles, BatchEnsemble is not only parallelizable across devices, where one device trains one member, but also parallelizable within a device, where multiple ensemble members are updated simultaneously for a given mini-batch. Across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, WMT14 EN-DE/EN-FR translation, and out-of-distribution tasks, BatchEnsemble yields competitive accuracy and uncertainties as typical ensembles; the speedup at test time is 3X and memory reduction is 3X at an ensemble of size 4. We also apply BatchEnsemble to lifelong learning, where on Split-CIFAR-100, BatchEnsemble yields comparable performance to progressive neural networks while having a much lower computational and memory costs. We further show that BatchEnsemble can easily scale up to lifelong learning on Split-ImageNet which involves 100 sequential learning tasks
10	Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have been extensively used to classify nodes in graphs and have been shown to outperform most other node classification methods. However, there are currently few GCN based formalism for graph classification tasks. In this task, graphs of different sizes (e.g. graphs representing different protein structures) belong to different classes, and one attempts to predict the graph class. We here propose a solution combing GCN and methods from knowledge graphs to produce a quadratic GCN (Q-GCN). We extend the GCN formalism by adding a quadratic layer to a standard GCN to classify full graphs. Such a layer produces an output with dimensions independent of the graph node number. This output is then passed through a softmax to classify full graphs. We applied this method to a wide range of graph classification problems and show that such a straightforward formalism outperforms state of the art methods for binary graph classification with or without external input on each graph. 
10	We achieve bias-variance decomposition for Boltzmann machines using an information geometric formulation. Our decomposition leads to an interesting phenomenon that the variance does not necessarily increase when more parameters are included in Boltzmann machines, while the bias always decreases. Our result gives a theoretical evidence of the generalization ability of deep learning architectures because it provides the possibility of increasing the representation power with avoiding the variance inflation.
01	Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has attracted a lot of attention due to its simplicity and small search costs achieved by a continuous relaxation and an approximation of the resulting bi-level optimization problem.  However, DARTS does not work robustly for new problems: we identify a wide range of search spaces for which DARTS yields degenerate architectures with very poor test performance. We study this failure mode and show that, while DARTS successfully minimizes validation loss, the found solutions generalize poorly when they coincide with high validation loss curvature in the  architecture space. We show that by adding one of various types of regularization we can robustify DARTS to find solutions with less curvature and better generalization properties. Based on these observations, we propose several simple variations of DARTS that perform substantially more robustly in practice.  Our observations are robust across five search spaces on three image classification tasks and also hold for the very different domains of disparity estimation (a dense regression task) and language modelling.
10	The recent development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has achieved great success using large pre-trained models with hundreds of millions of parameters. However, these models suffer from the heavy model size and high latency such that we cannot directly deploy them to resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose MobileBERT for compressing and accelerating the popular BERT model. Like BERT, MobileBERT is task-agnostic; that is, it can be universally applied to various downstream NLP tasks via fine-tuning. MobileBERT is a slimmed version of BERT-LARGE augmented with bottleneck structures and a carefully designed balance between self-attentions and feed-forward networks. To train MobileBERT, we use a bottom-to-top progressive scheme to transfer the intrinsic knowledge of a specially designed Inverted Bottleneck BERT-LARGE teacher to it. Empirical studies show that MobileBERT is 4.3x smaller and 4.0x faster than original BERT-BASE while achieving competitive results on well-known NLP benchmarks. On the natural language inference tasks of GLUE, MobileBERT achieves 0.6 GLUE score performance degradation, and 367 ms latency on a Pixel 3 phone. On the SQuAD v1.1/v2.0 question answering task, MobileBERT achieves a 90.0/79.2 dev F1 score, which is 1.5/2.1 higher than BERT-BASE. 
01	Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a family of generative models that do not minimize a single training criterion. Unlike other generative models, the data distribution is learned via a game between a generator (the generative model) and a discriminator (a teacher providing training signal) that each minimize their own cost. GANs are designed to reach a Nash equilibrium at which each player cannot reduce their cost without changing the other players‚Äô parameters. One useful approach for the theory of GANs is to show that a divergence between the training distribution and the model distribution obtains its minimum value at equilibrium. Several recent research directions have been motivated by the idea that this divergence is the primary guide for the learning process and that every step of learning should decrease the divergence. We show that this view is overly restrictive. During GAN training, the discriminator provides learning signal in situations where the gradients of the divergences between distributions would not be useful. We provide empirical counterexamples to the view of GAN training as divergence minimization. Specifically, we demonstrate that GANs are able to learn distributions in situations where the divergence minimization point of view predicts they would fail. We also show that gradient penalties motivated from the divergence minimization perspective are equally helpful when applied in other contexts in which the divergence minimization perspective does not predict they would be helpful. This contributes to a growing body of evidence that GAN training may be more usefully viewed as approaching Nash equilibria via trajectories that do not necessarily minimize a specific divergence at each step.
01	Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) is a powerful text embedding method. Due to its strong capabilities to encode word content, CBOW embeddings perform well on a wide range of downstream tasks while being efficient to compute. However, CBOW is not capable of capturing the word order. The reason is that the computation of CBOW's word embeddings is commutative, i.e., embeddings of XYZ and ZYX are the same. In order to address this shortcoming, we propose alearning algorithm for the Continuous Matrix Space Model, which we call Continual Multiplication of Words (CMOW). Our algorithm is an adaptation of word2vec, so that it can be trained on large quantities of unlabeled text. We empirically show that CMOW better captures linguistic properties, but it is inferior to CBOW in memorizing word content. Motivated by these findings, we propose a hybrid model that combines the strengths of CBOW and CMOW. Our results show that the hybrid CBOW-CMOW-model retains CBOW's strong ability to memorize word content while at the same time substantially improving its ability to encode other linguistic information by 8%. As a result, the hybrid also performs better on 8 out of 11 supervised downstream tasks with an average improvement of 1.2%.
10	Unsupervised image-to-image translation is a recently proposed task of translating an image to a different style or domain given only unpaired image examples at training time. In this paper, we formulate a new task of unsupervised video-to-video translation, which poses its own unique challenges. Translating video implies learning not only the appearance of objects and scenes but also realistic motion and transitions between consecutive frames. We investigate the performance of per-frame video-to-video translation using existing image-to-image translation networks, and propose a spatio-temporal 3D translator as an alternative solution to this problem. We evaluate our 3D method on multiple synthetic datasets, such as moving colorized digits, as well as the realistic segmentation-to-video GTA dataset and a new CT-to-MRI volumetric images translation dataset. Our results show that frame-wise translation produces realistic results on a single frame level but underperforms significantly on the scale of the whole video compared to our three-dimensional translation approach, which is better able to learn the complex structure of video and motion and continuity of object appearance. 
01	"Neuronal assemblies, loosely defined as subsets of neurons with reoccurring spatio-temporally coordinated activation patterns, or ""motifs"", are thought to be building blocks of neural representations and information processing. We here propose LeMoNADe, a new exploratory data analysis method that facilitates hunting for motifs in calcium imaging videos, the dominant microscopic functional imaging modality in neurophysiology. Our nonparametric method extracts motifs directly from videos, bypassing the difficult intermediate step of spike extraction. Our technique augments variational autoencoders with a discrete stochastic node, and we show in detail how a differentiable reparametrization and relaxation can be used. An evaluation on simulated data, with available ground truth, reveals excellent quantitative performance. In real video data acquired from brain slices, with no ground truth available, LeMoNADe uncovers nontrivial candidate motifs that can help generate hypotheses for more focused biological investigations."
10	The evaluation of robustness against adversarial manipulations of neural networks-based classifiers is mainly tested with empirical attacks as the methods for the exact computation, even when available, do not scale to large networks. We propose in this paper a new white-box adversarial attack wrt the $l_p$-norms for $p \in \{1,2,\infty\}$ aiming at finding the minimal perturbation necessary to change the class of a given input. It has an intuitive geometric meaning, yields quickly high quality results, minimizes the size of the perturbation (so that it returns the robust accuracy at every threshold with a single run). It performs better or similarly to state-of-the-art attacks which are partially specialized to one $l_p$-norm.
10	We show that for any convex differentiable loss,  a deep linear network has no spurious local minima as long as it is true for the two layer case.  This reduction greatly simplifies the study on the existence of spurious local minima in deep linear networks. When applied to the quadratic loss, our result immediately implies the powerful result by Kawaguchi (2016). Further, with the recent work by Zhou& Liang (2018), we can remove all the assumptions in (Kawaguchi, 2016).  This property  holds  for  more  general  ‚Äúmulti-tower‚Äù  linear  networks  too.  Our  proof builds on the work in (Laurent & von Brecht, 2018) and develops a new perturbation argument to show that any spurious local minimum must have full rank, a structural property which can be useful more generally
10	Adversarial training provides a principled approach for training robust neural networks. From an optimization perspective, the adversarial training is essentially solving a minimax robust optimization problem. The outer minimization is trying to learn a robust classifier, while the inner maximization is trying to generate adversarial samples. Unfortunately, such a minimax problem is very difficult to solve due to the lack of convex-concave structure. This work proposes a new adversarial training method based on a generic learning-to-learn (L2L) framework. Specifically, instead of applying the existing hand-designed algorithms for the inner problem, we learn an optimizer, which is parametrized as a convolutional neural network. At the same time, a robust classifier is learned to defense the adversarial attack generated by the learned optimizer. Our experiments over CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that the L2L outperforms existing adversarial training methods in both classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, our L2L framework can be extended to the generative adversarial imitation learning and stabilize the training.
10	Sequence-to-Sequence  (Seq2Seq)  neural  models  have  become  popular  for  text generation problems,  e.g.   neural machine translation (NMT) (Bahdanau et al.,2014;  Britz  et  al.,  2017),  text  summarization  (Nallapati  et  al.,  2017;  Wang  &Ling, 2016), and image captioning (Venugopalan et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017). Though sequential modeling has been shown to be effective, the dependency graph among words contains additional semantic information and thus can be utilized for sentence modeling. In this paper, we propose a Graph-Sequence-to-Sequence(GraphSeq2Seq) model to fuse the dependency graph among words into the traditional  Seq2Seq  framework.   For each sample,  the sub-graph  of each word is encoded to a graph representation, which is then utilized to sequential encoding. At last, a sequence decoder is leveraged for output generation. Since above model fuses different features by contacting them together to encode, we also propose a variant of our model that regards the graph representations as additional annotations in attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014) by separately encoding different features.  Experiments on several translation benchmarks show that our models can outperform existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the combination of Graph2Seq and Seq2Seq.
10	Gaussian processes are ubiquitous in nature and engineering. A case in point is a class of neural networks in the infinite-width limit, whose priors correspond to Gaussian processes. Here we perturbatively extend this correspondence to finite-width neural networks, yielding non-Gaussian processes as priors. The methodology developed herein allows us to track the flow of preactivation distributions by progressively integrating out random variables from lower to higher layers, reminiscent of renormalization-group flow. We further develop a perturbative prescription to perform Bayesian inference with weakly non-Gaussian priors.
10	Recent work has focused on combining kernel methods and deep learning. With this in mind, we introduce Deepstr√∂m networks -- a new architecture of neural networks which we use to replace top dense layers of standard convolutional architectures with an approximation of a kernel function by relying on the Nystr√∂m approximation. Our approach is easy highly flexible. It is compatible with any kernel function and it allows exploiting multiple kernels. We show that Deepstr√∂m networks reach state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets like SVHN and CIFAR100. One benefit of the method lies in its limited number of learnable parameters which make it particularly suited for small training set sizes, e.g. from 5 to 20 samples per class. Finally we illustrate two ways of using multiple kernels, including a multiple Deepstr√∂m  setting, that exploits a kernel on each feature map output by the convolutional part of the model.    
10	 Interest has been rising lately towards methods representing data in non-Euclidean spaces, e.g. hyperbolic or spherical. These geometries provide specific inductive biases useful for certain real-world data properties, e.g. scale-free or hierarchical graphs are best embedded in a hyperbolic space. However, the very popular class of  graph neural networks is currently limited to model data only via Euclidean node embeddings and associated vector space operations. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing mathematically grounded generalizations of graph convolutional networks (GCN) to (products of) constant curvature spaces. We do this by i) extending the gyro-vector space theory from hyperbolic to spherical spaces, providing a unified and smooth view of the two geometries, ii) leveraging gyro-barycentric coordinates that generalize the classic Euclidean concept of the center of mass. Our class of models gives strict generalizations in the sense that they recover their Euclidean counterparts when the curvature goes to zero from either side. Empirically, our methods outperform different types of classic Euclidean GCNs in the tasks of node classification and minimizing distortion for symbolic data exhibiting non-Euclidean behavior, according to their discrete curvature. 
01	Batch Normalization (BN) has become a cornerstone of deep learning across diverse architectures, appearing to help optimization as well as generalization. While the idea makes intuitive sense, theoretical analysis of its effectiveness has been lacking. Here theoretical support is provided for one of its conjectured properties, namely, the ability to allow gradient descent to succeed with less tuning of learning rates. It is shown that even if we fix the learning rate of scale-invariant parameters (e.g., weights of each layer with BN) to a constant (say, 0.3), gradient descent still approaches a stationary point (i.e., a solution where gradient is zero) in the rate of T^{‚àí1/2} in T iterations, asymptotically matching the best bound for gradient descent with well-tuned learning rates. A similar result with convergence rate T^{‚àí1/4} is also shown for stochastic gradient descent.
01	While many active learning papers assume that the learner can simply ask for a label and receive it, real annotation often presents a mismatch between the form of a label (say, one among many classes), and the form of an annotation (typically yes/no binary feedback). To annotate examples corpora for multiclass classification, we might need to ask multiple yes/no questions, exploiting a label hierarchy if one is available. To address this more realistic setting, we propose active learning with partial feedback (ALPF), where the learner must actively choose both which example to label and which binary question to ask. At each step, the learner selects an example, asking if it belongs to a chosen (possibly composite) class. Each answer eliminates some classes, leaving the learner with a partial label. The learner may then either ask more questions about the same example (until an exact label is uncovered) or move on immediately, leaving the first example partially labeled. Active learning with partial labels requires (i) a sampling strategy to choose (example, class) pairs, and (ii) learning from partial labels between rounds. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our most effective method improves 26% (relative) in top-1 classification accuracy compared to i.i.d. baselines and standard active learners given 30% of the annotation budget that would be required (naively) to annotate the dataset. Moreover, ALPF-learners fully annotate TinyImageNet at 42% lower cost. Surprisingly, we observe that accounting for per-example annotation costs can alter the conventional wisdom that active learners should solicit labels for hard examples.
10	Cold-start and efficiency issues of the Top-k recommendation are critical to large-scale recommender systems. Previous hybrid recommendation methods are effective to deal with the cold-start issues by extracting real latent factors of cold-start items(users) from side information, but they still suffer low efficiency in online recommendation caused by the expensive similarity search in real latent space. This paper presents a collaborative generated hashing (CGH) to improve the efficiency by denoting users and items as binary codes, which applies to various settings: cold-start users, cold-start items and warm-start ones. Specifically, CGH is designed to learn hash functions of users and items through the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle; thus, it can deal with various recommendation settings. In addition, CGH initiates a new marketing strategy through mining potential users by a generative step. To reconstruct effective users, the MDL principle is used to learn compact and informative binary codes from the content data. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the advantages for recommendations in various settings over competing baselines and analyze the feasibility of the application in marketing.
10	Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are known to be robust against label noise on extensive datasets. However, at the same time, CNNs are capable of memorizing all labels even if they are random, which means they can memorize corrupted labels. Are CNNs robust or fragile to label noise? Much of researches focusing on such memorization uses class-independent label noise to simulate label corruption, but this setting is simple and unrealistic. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of CNNs under class-dependently simulated label noise, which is generated based on the conceptual distance between classes of a large dataset (i.e., ImageNet-1k). Contrary to previous knowledge, we reveal CNNs are more robust to such class-dependent label noise than class-independent label noise. We also demonstrate the networks under class-dependent noise situations learn similar representation to the no noise situation, compared to class-independent noise situations.
10	An important property of image classification systems in the real world is that they both accurately classify objects from target classes (``knowns'') and safely reject unknown objects (``unknowns'') that belong to classes not present in the training data. Unfortunately, although the strong generalization ability of existing CNNs ensures their accuracy when classifying known objects, it also causes them to often assign an unknown to a target class with high confidence. As a result, simply using low-confidence detections as a way to detect unknowns does not work well. In this work, we propose an Unknown-aware Deep Neural Network (UDN for short) to solve this challenging problem. The key idea of UDN is to enhance existing CNNs to support a product operation that models the product relationship among the features produced by convolutional layers. This way, missing a single key feature of a target class will greatly reduce the probability of assigning an object to this class. UDN uses a learned ensemble of these product operations, which allows it to balance the contradictory requirements of accurately classifying known objects and correctly rejecting unknowns. To further improve the performance of UDN at detecting unknowns, we propose an information-theoretic regularization strategy that incorporates the objective of rejecting unknowns into the learning process of UDN. We experiment on benchmark image datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, adding unknowns by injecting one dataset into another. Our results demonstrate that UDN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods at rejecting unknowns by 25 percentage points improvement in accuracy, while still preserving the classification accuracy. 
10	That machine learning algorithms can demonstrate bias is well-documented by now. This work confronts the challenge of bias mitigation in feedforward fully-connected neural nets from the lens of causal inference and multiobjective optimisation. Regarding the former, a new causal notion of fairness is introduced that is particularly suited to giving a nuanced treatment of datasets collected under unfair practices. In particular, special attention is paid to subjects whose covariates could appear with substantial probability in either value of the sensitive attribute.  Next, recognising that fairness and accuracy are competing objectives, the proposed methodology uses techniques from multiobjective optimisation to ascertain the fairness-accuracy landscape of a neural net classifier. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method produces neural net classifiers that distribute evenly across the Pareto front of the fairness-accuracy space and is more efficient at finding non-dominated points than an adversarial approach.
10	"Multi-domain data are widely leveraged in vision applications to take advantage of complementary information from each modality, e.g., brain tumor segmentation from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, due to different imaging protocol and data loss or corruption, the availability of images in all domains could vary amongst multiple data sources in practice, which makes it challenging to train and test a universal model with a varied set of input data. To tackle this problem, we propose a general approach to complete the possible missing domain of the input data in a variety of application settings. Specifically, we develop a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture that utilizes a representational disentanglement scheme for shared `""skeleton"" encoding and separate `""flesh"" encoding across multiple domains. We further illustrate that the learned representation in the multi-domain image translation could be leveraged for higher-level recognition, like segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a unified framework of image completion branch and segmentation branch with a shared content encoder. We demonstrate constant and significant performance improvement by integrating the proposed representation disentanglement scheme in both multi-domain image completion and image segmentation tasks using three evaluation datasets individually for brain tumor segmentation, prostate segmentation, and facial expression image completion."
01	Recent AI research has emphasised the importance of learning disentangled representations of the explanatory factors  behind data. Despite the growing interest in models which can learn such representations, visual inspection remains the standard evaluation metric. While various desiderata have been implied in recent definitions, it is currently unclear what exactly makes one disentangled representation better than another. In this work we propose a framework for the quantitative evaluation of disentangled representations when the ground-truth latent structure is available. Three criteria are explicitly defined and quantified to elucidate the quality of learnt representations and thus compare models on an equal basis. To illustrate the appropriateness of the framework, we employ it to compare quantitatively the representations learned by recent state-of-the-art models.
10	Learning high-quality word embeddings is of significant importance in achieving better performance in many down-stream learning tasks. On one hand, traditional word embeddings are trained on a large scale corpus for general-purpose tasks, which are often sub-optimal for many domain-specific tasks. On the other hand, many domain-specific tasks do not have a large enough domain corpus to obtain high-quality embeddings. We observe that domains are not isolated and a small domain corpus can leverage the learned knowledge from many past domains to augment that corpus in order to generate high-quality embeddings. In this paper, we formulate the learning of word embeddings as a lifelong learning process. Given knowledge learned from many previous domains and a small new domain corpus, the proposed method can effectively generate new domain embeddings by leveraging a simple but effective algorithm and a meta-learner, where the meta-learner is able to provide word context similarity information at the domain-level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively learn new domain embeddings from a small corpus and past domain knowledges\footnote{We will release the code after final revisions.}. We also demonstrate that general-purpose embeddings trained from a large scale corpus are sub-optimal in domain-specific tasks.
01	Neural program synthesis from input-output examples has attracted an increasing interest from both the machine learning and the programming language community. Most existing neural program synthesis approaches employ an encoder-decoder architecture, which uses an encoder to compute the embedding of the given input-output examples, as well as a decoder to generate the program from the embedding following a given syntax. Although such approaches achieve a reasonable performance on simple tasks such as FlashFill, on more complex tasks such as Karel, the state-of-the-art approach can only achieve an accuracy of around 77%. We observe that the main drawback of existing approaches is that the semantic information is greatly under-utilized. In this work, we propose two simple yet principled techniques to better leverage the semantic information, which are execution-guided synthesis and synthesizer ensemble. These techniques are general enough to be combined with any existing encoder-decoder-style neural program synthesizer. Applying our techniques to the Karel dataset, we can boost the accuracy from around 77% to more than 90%.
10	The dominant approaches to sentence representation in natural language rely on learning embeddings on massive corpuses. The obtained embeddings have desirable properties such as compositionality and distance preservation (sentences with similar meanings have similar representations). In this paper, we develop a novel method for learning an embedding enjoying a dilation invariance property. We propose two algorithms: Orthrus, a classification algorithm, constrains the distribution of the embedded variable to be regularly varying, i.e. multivariate heavy-tail. and uses Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to tackle the classification task on two separate regions: the tail and the bulk. Hydra, a text generation algorithm for dataset augmentation, leverages the invariance property of the embedding learnt by Orthrus to generate coherent sentences with controllable attribute, e.g. positive or negative sentiment. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real text data demonstrate the relevance of the proposed framework.
10	While pre-training and fine-tuning, e.g., BERT~\citep{devlin2018bert}, GPT-2~\citep{radford2019language}, have achieved great success in language understanding and generation tasks, the pre-trained models are usually too big for online deployment in terms of both memory cost and inference speed, which hinders them from practical online usage. In this paper, we propose LightPAFF, a Lightweight Pre-training And Fine-tuning Framework that leverages two-stage knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a big teacher model to a lightweight student model in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. In this way the lightweight model can achieve similar accuracy as the big teacher model, but with much fewer parameters and thus faster online inference speed. LightPAFF can support different pre-training methods (such as BERT, GPT-2 and MASS~\citep{song2019mass}) and be applied to many downstream tasks. Experiments on three language understanding tasks, three language modeling tasks and three sequence to sequence generation tasks demonstrate that while achieving similar accuracy with the big BERT, GPT-2 and MASS models, LightPAFF reduces the model size by nearly 5x and improves online inference speed by 5x-7x.
10	Recent research has shown that CNNs are often overly sensitive to high-frequency textural patterns. Inspired by the intuition that humans are more sensitive to the lower-frequency (larger-scale) patterns we design a regularization scheme that penalizes large differences between adjacent components within each convolutional kernel. We apply our regularization onto several popular training methods, demonstrating that the models with the proposed smooth kernels enjoy improved adversarial robustness. Further, building on recent work establishing connections between adversarial robustness and interpretability, we show that our method appears to give more perceptually-aligned gradients. 
10	The complex world around us is inherently multimodal and sequential (continuous). Information is scattered across different modalities and requires multiple continuous sensors to be captured. As machine learning leaps towards better generalization to real world, multimodal sequential learning becomes a fundamental research area. Arguably,  modeling arbitrarily distributed spatio-temporal dynamics within and across modalities is the biggest challenge in this research area. In this paper, we present a new transformer model, called the Factorized Multimodal Transformer (FMT) for multimodal sequential learning. FMT inherently models the intramodal and intermodal (involving two or more modalities) dynamics within its multimodal input in a factorized manner. The proposed factorization allows for increasing the number of self-attentions to better model the multimodal phenomena at hand; without encountering difficulties during training (e.g. overfitting) even on relatively low-resource setups. All the attention mechanisms within FMT have a full time-domain receptive field which allows them to asynchronously capture long-range multimodal dynamics. In our experiments we focus on datasets that contain the three commonly studied modalities of language, vision and acoustic. We perform a wide range of experiments, spanning across 3 well-studied datasets and 21 distinct labels. FMT shows superior performance over previously proposed models, setting new state of the art in  the studied datasets.
10	A significant issue in training deep neural networks to solve supervised learningtasks is the need for large numbers of labeled datapoints. The goal of semisupervised learning is to leverage ubiquitous unlabeled data, together with small quantities of labeled data, to achieve high task performance. Though substantial recent progress has been made in developing semi-supervised algorithms that are effective for comparatively small datasets, many of these techniques do not scale readily to the large (unlabeled) datasets characteristic of real-world applications. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to scalable semi-supervised learning, called Local Label Propagation (LLP). Extending ideas from recent work on unsupervised embedding learning, LLP first embeds datapoints, labeled and otherwise, in a common latent space using a deep neural network. It then propagates pseudolabels from known to unknown datapoints in a manner that depends on the local geometry of the embedding, taking into account both inter-point distance and local data density as a weighting on propagation likelihood. The parameters of the deep embedding are then trained to simultaneously maximize pseudolabel categorization performance as well as a metric of the clustering of datapoints within each psuedo-label group, iteratively alternating stages of network training and label propagation. We illustrate the utility of the LLP method on the ImageNet dataset, achieving results that outperform previous state-of-the-art scalable semi-supervised learning algorithms by large margins, consistently across a wide variety of training regimes. We also show that the feature representation learned with LLP transfers well to scene recognition in the Places 205 dataset.
01	"Training activation quantized neural networks involves minimizing a piecewise constant training loss whose gradient vanishes almost everywhere, which is undesirable for the standard back-propagation or chain rule. An empirical way around this issue is to use a straight-through estimator (STE) (Bengio et al., 2013) in the backward pass only, so that the ""gradient"" through the modified chain rule becomes non-trivial. Since this unusual ""gradient"" is certainly not the gradient of loss function, the following question arises: why searching in its negative direction minimizes the training loss? In this paper, we provide the theoretical justification of the concept of STE by answering this question. We consider the problem of learning a two-linear-layer network with binarized ReLU activation and Gaussian input data. We shall refer to the unusual ""gradient"" given by the STE-modifed chain rule as coarse gradient. The choice of STE is not unique. We prove that if the STE is properly chosen, the expected coarse gradient correlates positively with the population gradient (not available for the training), and its negation is a descent direction for minimizing the population loss. We further show the associated coarse gradient descent algorithm converges to a critical point of the population loss minimization problem.  Moreover, we show that a poor choice of STE leads to instability of the training algorithm near certain local minima, which is verified with CIFAR-10 experiments."
01	Adaptive gradient algorithms perform gradient-based updates using the history of gradients and are ubiquitous in training deep neural networks. While adaptive gradient methods theory is well understood for minimization problems, the underlying factors driving their empirical success in min-max problems such as GANs remain unclear. In this paper, we aim at bridging  this gap from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. First, we analyze a variant of Optimistic Stochastic Gradient (OSG) proposed in~\citep{daskalakis2017training} for solving a class of non-convex non-concave min-max problem and establish $O(\epsilon^{-4})$ complexity for finding $\epsilon$-first-order stationary point, in which the algorithm only requires invoking one stochastic first-order oracle while enjoying state-of-the-art iteration complexity achieved by stochastic extragradient method by~\citep{iusem2017extragradient}. Then we propose an adaptive variant of OSG named Optimistic Adagrad (OAdagrad) and reveal an \emph{improved} adaptive complexity $\widetilde{O}\left(\epsilon^{-\frac{2}{1-\alpha}}\right)$~\footnote{Here $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ compresses a logarithmic factor of $\epsilon$.}, where $\alpha$ characterizes the growth rate of the cumulative stochastic gradient and $0\leq \alpha\leq 1/2$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for establishing adaptive complexity in non-convex non-concave min-max optimization. Empirically, our experiments show that indeed adaptive gradient algorithms outperform their non-adaptive counterparts in GAN training. Moreover, this observation can be explained by the slow growth rate of the cumulative stochastic gradient, as observed empirically.
10	Learning causal relations from observational time series with nonlinear interactions and complex causal structures is a key component of human intelligence, and has a wide range of applications. Although neural nets have demonstrated their effectiveness in a variety of fields, their application in learning causal relations has been scarce. This is due to both a lack of theoretical results connecting risk minimization and causality (enabling function approximators like neural nets to apply), and a lack of scalability in prior causal measures to allow for expressive function approximators like neural nets to apply. In this work, we propose a novel causal measure and algorithm using risk minimization to infer causal relations from time series. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithms to learn nonlinear causal models in synthetic datasets as comparing to other methods, and its effectiveness in inferring causal relations in a video game environment and real-world heart-rate vs. breath-rate and rat brain EEG datasets.
10	Humans can learn task-agnostic priors from interactive experience and utilize the priors for novel tasks without any finetuning. In this paper, we propose Scoring-Aggregating-Planning (SAP), a framework that can learn task-agnostic semantics and dynamics priors from arbitrary quality interactions as well as the corresponding sparse rewards and then plan on unseen tasks in zero-shot condition. The framework finds a neural score function for local regional state and action pairs that can be aggregated to approximate the quality of a full trajectory; moreover, a dynamics model that is learned with self-supervision can be incorporated for planning. Many of previous works that leverage interactive data for policy learning either need massive on-policy environmental interactions or assume access to expert data while we can achieve a similar goal with pure off-policy imperfect data. Instantiating our framework results in a generalizable policy to unseen tasks. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform baseline methods on a wide range of applications including gridworld, robotics tasks and video games.
01	Many real-world systems studied are governed by complex, nonlinear dynamics.  By modeling these dynamics, we can gain insight into how these systems work, make predictions about how they will behave, and develop strategies for controlling them. While there are many methods for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems, existing techniques face a trade off between offering interpretable descriptions and making accurate predictions.  Here, we develop a class of models that aims to achieve both simultaneously, smoothly interpolating between simple descriptions and more complex, yet also more accurate models.  Our probabilistic model achieves this multi-scale property through of a hierarchy of locally linear dynamics that jointly approximate global nonlinear dynamics. We call it the tree-structured recurrent switching linear dynamical system. To fit this model, we present a fully-Bayesian sampling procedure using Polya-Gamma data augmentation to allow for fast and conjugate Gibbs sampling.  Through a variety of synthetic and real examples, we show how these models outperform existing methods in both interpretability and predictive capability.
01	In weakly-supervised temporal action localization, previous works have failed to locate dense and integral regions for each entire action due to the overestimation of the most salient regions. To alleviate this issue, we propose a marginalized average attentional network (MAAN) to suppress the dominant response of the most salient regions in a principled manner. The MAAN employs a novel marginalized average aggregation (MAA) module and learns a set of latent discriminative probabilities in an end-to-end fashion.  MAA samples multiple subsets from the video snippet features according to a set of latent discriminative probabilities and takes the expectation over all the averaged subset features. Theoretically, we prove that the MAA module with learned latent discriminative probabilities successfully reduces the difference in responses between the most salient regions and the others. Therefore, MAAN is able to generate better class activation sequences and identify dense and integral action regions in the videos. Moreover, we propose a fast algorithm to reduce the complexity of constructing MAA from $O(2^T)$ to $O(T^2)$. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video datasets show that our MAAN achieves a superior performance on weakly-supervised temporal action localization.
10	Truly intelligent agents need to capture the interplay of all their senses to build a rich physical understanding of their world. In robotics, we have seen tremendous progress in using visual and tactile perception; however we have often ignored a key sense: sound. This is primarily due to lack of data that captures the interplay of action and sound. In this work, we perform the first large-scale study of the interactions between sound and robotic action. To do this, we create the largest available sound-action-vision dataset with 15,000 interactions on 60 objects using our robotic platform Tilt-Bot. By tilting objects and allowing them to crash into the walls of a robotic tray, we collect rich four-channel audio information. Using this data, we explore the synergies between sound and action, and present three key insights. First, sound is indicative of fine-grained object class information, e.g., sound can differentiate a metal screwdriver from a metal wrench. Second, sound also contains information about the causal effects of an action, i.e. given the sound produced, we can predict what action was applied on the object. Finally, object representations derived from audio embeddings are indicative of implicit physical properties. We demonstrate that on previously unseen objects, audio embeddings generated through interactions can predict forward models 24% better than passive visual embeddings. 
10	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been shown to produce realistically looking synthetic images with remarkable success, yet their performance seems less impressive when the training set is highly diverse. In order to provide a better fit to the target data distribution when the dataset includes many different classes, we propose a variant of the basic GAN model, a Multi-Modal Gaussian-Mixture GAN (GM-GAN), where the probability distribution over the latent space is a mixture of Gaussians. We also propose a supervised variant which is capable of conditional sample synthesis. In order to evaluate the model's performance, we propose a new scoring method which separately takes into account two (typically conflicting) measures - diversity vs. quality of the generated data.  Through a series of experiments, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we quantitatively show that GM-GANs outperform baselines, both when evaluated using the commonly used Inception Score, and when evaluated using our own alternative scoring method. In addition, we qualitatively demonstrate how the unsupervised variant of GM-GAN tends to map latent vectors sampled from different Gaussians in the latent space to samples of different classes in the data space. We show how this phenomenon can be exploited for the task of unsupervised clustering, and provide quantitative evaluation showing the superiority of our method for the unsupervised clustering of image datasets. Finally, we demonstrate a feature which further sets our model apart from other GAN models: the option to control the quality-diversity trade-off by altering, post-training, the probability distribution of the latent space. This allows one to sample higher quality and lower diversity samples, or vice versa, according to one's needs.
10	To continuously improve quality and reflect changes in data, machine learning-based services have to regularly re-train and update their core models. In the setting of language models, we show that a comparative analysis of model snapshots before and after an update can reveal a surprising amount of detailed information about the changes in the data used for training before and after the update.We discuss the privacy implications of our findings, propose mitigation strategies and evaluate their effect.
10	Predicting the time to the next event is an important task in various domains. However, due to censoring and irregularly sampled sequences, time-to-event prediction has resulted in limited success only for particular tasks, architectures and data. Using recent advances in probabilistic programming and density networks, we make the case for a generalized parametric survival approach, sequentially predicting a distribution over the time to the next event. Unlike previous work, the proposed method can use asynchronously sampled features for censored, discrete, and multivariate data. Furthermore, it achieves good performance and near perfect calibration for probabilistic predictions without using rigid network-architectures, multitask approaches, complex learning schemes or non-trivial adaptations of cox-models. We firmly establish that this can be achieved in the standard neural network framework by simply switching out the output layer and loss function.
10	Search space is a key consideration for neural architecture search. Recently, Xie et al. (2019a) found that randomly generated networks from the same distribution perform similarly, which suggest we should search for random graph distributions instead of graphs. We propose graphon as a new search space. A graphon is the limit of Cauchy sequence of graphs and a scale-free probabilistic distribution, from which graphs of different number of vertices can be drawn. This property enables us to perform NAS using fast, low-capacity models and scale the found models up when necessary. We develop an algorithm for NAS in the space of graphons and empirically demonstrate that it can find stage-wise graphs that outperform DenseNet and other baselines on ImageNet. 
01	Outlier detection and novelty detection are two important topics for anomaly detection. Suppose the majority of a dataset are drawn from a certain distribution, outlier detection and novelty detection both aim to detect data samples that do not fit the distribution. Outliers refer to data samples within this dataset, while novelties refer to new samples. In the meantime, backdoor poisoning attacks for machine learning models are achieved through injecting poisoning samples into the training dataset, which could be regarded as ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù that are intentionally added by attackers. Differential privacy has been proposed to avoid leaking any individual‚Äôs information, when aggregated analysis is performed on a given dataset. It is typically achieved by adding random noise, either directly to the input dataset, or to intermediate results of the aggregation mechanism. In this paper, we demonstrate that applying differential privacy could improve the utility of outlier detection and novelty detection, with an extension to detect poisoning samples in backdoor attacks. We first present a theoretical analysis on how differential privacy helps with the detection, and then conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of differential privacy in improving outlier detection, novelty detection, and backdoor attack detection.
01	We propose a multi-task learning framework to jointly learn document ranking and query suggestion for web search. It consists of two major components, a document ranker, and a query recommender. Document ranker combines current query and session information and compares the combined representation with document representation to rank the documents. Query recommender tracks users' query reformulation sequence considering all previous in-session queries using a sequence to sequence approach. As both tasks are driven by the users' underlying search intent, we perform joint learning of these two components through session recurrence, which encodes search context and intent. Extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art document ranking and query suggestion algorithms are performed on the public AOL search log, and the promising results endorse the effectiveness of the joint learning framework.
10	The problem of distributed representation learning is one in which multiple sources of information X1,...,XK are processed separately so as to extract useful information about some statistically correlated ground truth Y. We investigate this problem from information-theoretic grounds. For both discrete memoryless (DM) and memoryless vector Gaussian models, we establish fundamental limits of learning in terms of optimal tradeoffs between accuracy and complexity. We also develop a variational bound on the optimal tradeoff that generalizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) to the distributed setting. Furthermore, we provide a variational inference type algorithm that allows to compute this bound and in which the mappings are parametrized by neural networks and the bound approximated by Markov sampling and optimized with stochastic gradient descent. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets are provided to support the efficiency of the approaches and algorithms which we develop in this paper.
10	Sample-selection approaches, which attempt to pick up clean instances from the training data set, have become one promising direction to robust learning from corrupted labels. These methods all build on the memorization effect, which means deep networks learn easy patterns first and then gradually over-fit the training data set. In this paper, we show how to properly select instances so that the training process can benefit the most from the memorization effect is a hard problem. Specifically, memorization can heavily depend on many factors, e.g., data set and network architecture. Nonetheless, there still exists general patterns of how memorization can occur. These facts motivate us to exploit memorization by automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques. First, we designed an expressive but compact search space based on observed general patterns. Then, we propose to use the natural gradient-based search algorithm to efficiently search through space. Finally, extensive experiments on both synthetic data sets and benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can not only be much efficient than existing AutoML algorithms but can also achieve much better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches for learning from corrupted labels.
10	Uncertainty is a very important feature of the intelligence and helps the brain become a flexible, creative and powerful intelligent system. The crossbar-based neuromorphic computing chips, in which the computing is mainly performed by analog circuits, have the uncertainty and can be used to imitate the brain. However, most of the current deep neural networks have not taken the uncertainty of the neuromorphic computing chip into consideration. Therefore, their performances on the neuromorphic computing chips are not as good as on the original platforms (CPUs/GPUs). In this work, we proposed the uncertainty adaptation training scheme (UATS) that tells the uncertainty to the neural network in the training process. The experimental results show that the neural networks can achieve comparable inference performances on the uncertain neuromorphic computing chip compared to the results on the original platforms, and much better than the performances without this training scheme.
01	In seeking for sparse and efficient neural network models, many previous works investigated on enforcing L1 or L0 regularizers to encourage weight sparsity during training. The L0 regularizer measures the parameter sparsity directly and is invariant to the scaling of parameter values. But it cannot provide useful gradients and therefore requires complex optimization techniques. The L1 regularizer is almost everywhere differentiable and can be easily optimized with gradient descent. Yet it is not scale-invariant and causes the same shrinking rate to all parameters, which is inefficient in increasing sparsity. Inspired by the Hoyer measure (the ratio between L1 and L2 norms) used in traditional compressed sensing problems, we present DeepHoyer, a set of sparsity-inducing regularizers that are both differentiable almost everywhere and scale-invariant. Our experiments show that enforcing DeepHoyer regularizers can produce even sparser neural network models than previous works, under the same accuracy level. We also show that DeepHoyer can be applied to both element-wise and structural pruning.
10	Separating mixed distributions is a long standing challenge for machine learning and signal processing. Applications include: single-channel multi-speaker separation (cocktail party problem), singing voice separation and separating reflections from images. Most current methods either rely on making strong assumptions on the source distributions (e.g. sparsity, low rank, repetitiveness) or rely on having training samples of each source in the mixture. In this work, we tackle the scenario of extracting an unobserved distribution additively mixed with a signal from an observed (arbitrary) distribution. We introduce a new method: Neural Egg Separation - an iterative method that learns to separate the known distribution from progressively finer estimates of the unknown distribution. In some settings, Neural Egg Separation is initialization sensitive, we therefore introduce GLO Masking which ensures a good initialization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms current methods that use the same level of supervision and often achieves similar performance to full supervision. 
10	We learn to identify decision states, namely the parsimonious set of states where decisions meaningfully affect the future states an agent can reach in an environment. We utilize the VIC framework, which maximizes an agent‚Äôs `empowerment‚Äô, ie the ability to reliably reach a diverse set of states -- and formulate a sandwich bound on the empowerment objective that allows identification of decision states. Unlike previous work, our decision states are discovered without extrinsic rewards -- simply by interacting with the world. Our results show that our decision states are: 1) often interpretable, and 2) lead to better exploration on downstream goal-driven tasks in partially observable environments.
01	Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms have achieved great success on many challenging benchmarks (e.g., Computer Go). However, they generally require a large number of rollouts, making their applications costly. Furthermore, it is also extremely challenging to parallelize MCTS due to its inherent sequential nature: each rollout heavily relies on the statistics (e.g., node visitation counts) estimated from previous simulations to achieve an effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In spite of these difficulties, we develop an algorithm, WU-UCT, to effectively parallelize MCTS, which achieves linear speedup and exhibits only limited performance loss with an increasing number of workers. The key idea in WU-UCT is a set of statistics that we introduce to track the number of on-going yet incomplete simulation queries (named as unobserved samples). These statistics are used to modify the UCT tree policy in the selection steps in a principled manner to retain effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff when we parallelize the most time-consuming expansion and simulation steps. Experiments on a proprietary benchmark and the Atari Game benchmark demonstrate the linear speedup and the superior performance of WU-UCT comparing to existing techniques.
10	While deep neural networks have been shown to perform remarkably well in many machine learning tasks, labeling a large amount of supervised data is usually very costly to scale. Therefore, learning robust representations with unlabeled data is critical in relieving human effort and vital for many downstream applications. Recent advances in unsupervised and self-supervised learning approaches for visual data benefit greatly from domain knowledge. Here we are interested in a more generic unsupervised learning framework that can be easily generalized to other domains. In this paper, we propose to learn data representations with a novel type of denoising autoencoder, where the input noisy data is generated by corrupting the clean data in gradient domain. This can be naturally generalized to span multiple scales with a Laplacian pyramid representation of the input data. In this way, the agent has to learn more robust representations that can exploit the underlying data structures across multiple scales. Experiments on several visual benchmarks demonstrate that better representations can be learned with the proposed approach, compared to its counterpart with single-scale corruption. Besides, we also demonstrate that the learned representations perform well when transferring to other vision tasks.
10	Strong improvements in neural network performance in vision tasks have resulted from the search of alternative network architectures, and prior work has shown that this search process can be automated and guided by evaluating candidate network performance following limited training (‚ÄúPerformance Guided Architecture Search‚Äù or PGAS).  However, because of the large architecture search spaces and the high computational cost associated with evaluating each candidate model, further gains in computational efficiency are needed.  Here we present a method termed Teacher Guided Search for Architectures by Generation and Evaluation (TG-SAGE) that produces up to an order of magnitude in search efficiency over PGAS methods. Specifically, TG-SAGE guides each step of the architecture search by evaluating the similarity of internal representations of the candidate networks with those of the (fixed) teacher network. We show that this procedure leads to significant reduction in required per-sample training and that, this advantage holds for two different search spaces of architectures, and two different search algorithms. We further show that in the space of convolutional cells for visual categorization, TG-SAGE finds a cell structure with similar performance as was previously found using other methods but at a total computational cost that is two orders of magnitude lower than Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and more than four times lower than progressive neural architecture search (PNAS). These results suggest that TG-SAGE can be used to accelerate network architecture search in cases where one has access to some or all of the internal representations of a teacher network of interest, such as the brain. 
10	We present BlockBERT, a lightweight and efficient BERT model that is designed to better modeling long-distance dependencies. Our model extends BERT by introducing sparse block structures into the attention matrix to reduce both memory consumption and training time, which also enables attention heads to capture either short- or long-range contextual information. We conduct experiments on several benchmark question answering datasets with various paragraph lengths. Results show that BlockBERT uses 18.7-36.1% less memory and reduces the training time by 12.0-25.1%, while having comparable and sometimes better prediction accuracy, compared to an advanced BERT-based model, RoBERTa.
10	Image-to-image (I2I) translation aims to translate images from one domain to another. To tackle the multi-modal version of I2I translation, where input and output domains have a one-to-many relation, an extra latent input is provided to the generator to specify a particular output. Recent works propose involved training objectives to learn a latent embedding, jointly with the generator, that models the distribution of possible outputs. Alternatively, we study a simple, yet powerful pre-training strategy for multi-modal I2I translation. We first pre-train an encoder, using a proxy task, to encode the style of an image, such as color and texture, into a low-dimensional latent style vector. Then we train a generator to transform an input image along with a style-code to the output domain. Our generator achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks with a training objective that includes just a GAN loss and a reconstruction loss, which simplifies and speeds up the training significantly compared to competing approaches. We further study the contribution of different loss terms to learning the task of multi-modal I2I translation, and finally we show that the learned style embedding is not dependent on the target domain and generalizes well to other domains.
01	Stochastic AUC maximization has garnered an increasing interest due to better fit to imbalanced data classification. However, existing works are limited to stochastic AUC maximization with a linear predictive model, which restricts its predictive power when dealing with extremely complex data. In this paper, we consider stochastic AUC maximization problem with a deep neural network as the predictive model. Building on the saddle point reformulation of a surrogated loss of AUC, the problem can be cast into a {\it non-convex concave} min-max problem. The main contribution made in this paper is to make stochastic AUC maximization more practical for deep neural networks and big data with theoretical insights as well. In particular, we propose to explore Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) condition that has been proved and observed in deep learning, which enables us to develop new stochastic algorithms with even faster convergence rate and more practical step size scheme. An AdaGrad-style algorithm is also analyzed under the PL condition with adaptive convergence rate. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
10	Recovering 3D geometry shape, albedo and lighting from a single image has wide applications in many areas, which is also a typical ill-posed problem. In order to eliminate the ambiguity, face prior knowledge like linear 3D morphable models (3DMM) learned from limited scan data are often adopted to the reconstruction process. However, methods based on linear parametric models cannot generalize well for facial images in the wild with various ages, ethnicity, expressions, poses, and lightings. Recent methods aim to learn a nonlinear parametric model using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to regress the face shape and texture directly. However, the models were only trained on a dataset that is generated from a linear 3DMM. Moreover, the identity and expression representations are entangled in these models, which hurdles many facial editing applications. In this paper, we train our model with adversarial loss in a semi-supervised manner on hybrid batches of unlabeled and labeled face images to exploit the value of large amounts of unlabeled face images from unconstrained photo collections. A novel center loss is introduced to make sure that different facial images from the same person have the same identity shape and albedo. Besides, our proposed model disentangles identity, expression, pose, and lighting representations, which improves the overall reconstruction performance and facilitates facial editing applications, e.g., expression transfer. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model produces high-quality reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods and is robust to various expression, pose, and lighting conditions.
10	Neural language models have recently shown impressive gains in unconditional text generation, but controllable generation and manipulation of text remain challenging. In particular, controlling text via latent space operations in autoencoders has been difficult, in part due to chaotic latent space geometry. We propose to employ adversarial autoencoders together with denoising (referred as DAAE) to drive the latent space to organize itself. Theoretically, we prove that input sentence perturbations in the denoising approach encourage similar sentences to map to similar latent representations. Empirically, we illustrate the trade-off between text-generation and autoencoder-reconstruction capabilities, and our model significantly improves over other autoencoder variants. Even from completely unsupervised training, DAAE can successfully alter the tense/sentiment of sentences via simple latent vector arithmetic.
01	Bayesian phylogenetic inference is currently done via Markov chain Monte Carlo with simple mechanisms for proposing new states, which hinders exploration efficiency and often requires long runs to deliver accurate posterior estimates. In this paper we present an alternative approach: a variational framework for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. We approximate the true posterior using an expressive graphical model for tree distributions, called a subsplit Bayesian network, together with appropriate branch length distributions. We train the variational approximation via stochastic gradient ascent and adopt multi-sample based gradient estimators for different latent variables separately to handle the composite latent space of phylogenetic models. We show that our structured variational approximations are flexible enough to provide comparable posterior estimation to MCMC, while requiring less computation due to a more efficient tree exploration mechanism enabled by variational inference. Moreover, the variational approximations can be readily used for further statistical analysis such as marginal likelihood estimation for model comparison via importance sampling. Experiments on both synthetic data and real data Bayesian phylogenetic inference problems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.
10	Traditional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models and other variations of the attention-mechanism such as hierarchical attention have been applied to the text summarization problem. Though there is a hierarchy in the way humans use language by forming paragraphs from sentences and sentences from words, hierarchical models have usually not worked that much better than their traditional seq2seq counterparts. This effect is mainly because either the hierarchical attention mechanisms are too sparse using hard attention or noisy using soft attention. In this paper, we propose a method based on extracting the highlights of a document; a key concept that is conveyed in a few sentences. In a typical text summarization dataset consisting of documents that are 800 tokens in length (average), capturing long-term dependencies is very important, e.g., the last sentence can be grouped with the first sentence of a document to form a summary. LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) proved useful for machine translation. However, they often fail to capture long-term dependencies while modeling long sequences. To address these issues, we have adapted Neural Semantic Encoders (NSE) to text summarization, a class of memory-augmented neural networks by improving its functionalities and proposed a novel hierarchical NSE that outperforms similar previous models significantly. The quality of summarization was improved by augmenting linguistic factors, namely lemma, and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, to each word in the dataset for improved vocabulary coverage and generalization. The hierarchical NSE model on factored dataset outperformed the state-of-the-art by nearly 4 ROUGE points. We further designed and used the first GPU-based self-critical Reinforcement Learning model.
01	When constructing random forests, it is of prime importance to ensure high accuracy and low correlation of individual tree classifiers for good performance. Nevertheless, it is typically difficult for existing random forest methods to strike a good balance between these conflicting factors. In this work, we propose a generalized convolutional forest networks to learn a feature space to maximize the strength of individual tree classifiers while minimizing the respective correlation. The feature space is iteratively constructed by a probabilistic triplet sampling method based on the distribution obtained from the splits of the random forest. The sampling process is designed to pull the data of the same label together for higher strength and push away the data frequently falling to the same leaf nodes. We perform extensive experiments on five image classification and two domain generalization datasets with ResNet-50 and DenseNet-161 backbone networks. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.
10	In reinforcement learning, it is common to let an agent interact with its environment for a fixed amount of time before resetting the environment and repeating the process in a series of episodes. The task that the agent has to learn can either be to maximize its performance over (i) that fixed amount of time, or (ii) an indefinite period where the time limit is only used during training. In this paper, we investigate theoretically how time limits could effectively be handled in each of the two cases. In the first one, we argue that the terminations due to time limits are in fact part of the environment, and propose to include a notion of the remaining time as part of the agent's input. In the second case, the time limits are not part of the environment and are only used to facilitate learning. We argue that such terminations should not be treated as environmental ones and propose a method, specific to value-based algorithms, that incorporates this insight by continuing to bootstrap at the end of each partial episode. To illustrate the significance of our proposals, we perform several experiments on a range of environments from simple few-state transition graphs to complex control tasks, including novel and standard benchmark domains. Our results show that the proposed methods improve the performance and stability of existing reinforcement learning algorithms.
01	By representing words with probability densities rather than point vectors, proba- bilistic word embeddings can capture rich and interpretable semantic information and uncertainty (Vilnis & McCallum, 2014; Athiwaratkun & Wilson, 2017). The uncertainty information can be particularly meaningful in capturing entailment relationships ‚Äì whereby general words such as ‚Äúentity‚Äù correspond to broad distributions that encompass more specific words such as ‚Äúanimal‚Äù or ‚Äúinstrument‚Äù. We introduce density order embeddings, which learn hierarchical representations through encapsulation of probability distributions. In particular, we propose simple yet effective loss functions and distance metrics, as well as graph-based schemes to select negative samples to better learn hierarchical probabilistic representations. Our approach provides state-of-the-art performance on the WordNet hypernym relationship prediction task and the challenging HyperLex lexical entailment dataset ‚Äì while retaining a rich and interpretable probabilistic representation.
10	Pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features have popularly been used as full-reference perceptual quality features for CNN based image quality assessment, super-resolution, image restoration and a variety of image-to-image translation problems. In this paper, to get more insight, we link basic human visual perception to characteristics of learned deep CNN representations as a novel and first attempt to interpret them. We characterize the frequency and orientation tuning of channels in trained object detection deep CNNs (e.g., VGG-16) by applying grating stimuli of different spatial frequencies and orientations as input. We observe that the behavior of CNN channels as spatial frequency and orientation selective filters can be used to link basic human visual perception models to their characteristics. Doing so, we develop a theory to get more insight into deep CNN representations as perceptual quality features. We conclude that sensitivity to spatial frequencies that have lower contrast masking thresholds in human visual perception and a definite and strong orientation selectivity are important attributes of deep CNN channels that deliver better perceptual quality features. 
01	Deep convolutional neural networks are now widely deployed in vision applications, but a limited size of training data can restrict their task performance. Transfer learning offers the chance for CNNs to learn with limited data samples by transferring knowledge from models pretrained on large datasets. Blindly transferring all learned features from the source dataset, however, brings unnecessary computation to CNNs on the target task. In this paper, we propose attentive feature distillation and selection (AFDS), which not only adjusts the strength of transfer learning regularization but also dynamically determines the important features to transfer. By deploying AFDS on ResNet-101, we achieved a state-of-the-art computation reduction at the same accuracy budget, outperforming all existing transfer learning methods. With a 10x MACs reduction budget, a ResNet-101 equipped with AFDS transfer learned from ImageNet to Stanford Dogs 120, can achieve an accuracy 11.07% higher than its best competitor.
