01	Neural language models have been widely used in various NLP tasks, including machine translation, next word prediction and conversational agents. However, it is challenging to deploy these models on mobile devices due to their slow prediction speed, where the bottleneck is to compute top candidates in the softmax layer. In this paper, we introduce a novel softmax layer approximation algorithm by exploiting the clustering structure of context vectors. Our algorithm uses a light-weight screening model to predict a much smaller set of candidate words based on the given context, and then conducts an exact softmax only within that subset. Training such a procedure end-to-end is challenging as traditional clustering methods are discrete and non-differentiable, and thus unable to be used with back-propagation in the training process. Using the Gumbel softmax, we are able to train the screening model end-to-end on the training set to exploit data distribution. The algorithm achieves an order of magnitude faster inference than the original softmax layer for predicting top-k words in various tasks such as beam search in machine translation or next words prediction. For example, for machine translation task on German to English dataset with around 25K vocabulary, we can achieve 20.4 times speed up with 98.9% precision@1 and 99.3% precision@5 with the original softmax layer prediction, while state-of-the-art (Zhang et al., 2018) only achieves 6.7x speedup with 98.7% precision@1 and 98.1% precision@5 for the same task.	12	233	3	0	0	5.575107296137339
01	Pruning large neural networks while maintaining their performance is often desirable due to the reduced space and time complexity. In existing methods, pruning is done within an iterative optimization procedure with either heuristically designed pruning schedules or additional hyperparameters, undermining their utility. In this work, we present a new approach that prunes a given network once at initialization prior to training. To achieve this, we introduce a saliency criterion based on connection sensitivity that identifies structurally important connections in the network for the given task. This eliminates the need for both pretraining and the complex pruning schedule while making it robust to architecture variations. After pruning, the sparse network is trained in the standard way. Our method obtains extremely sparse networks with virtually the same accuracy as the reference network on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Tiny-ImageNet classification tasks and is broadly applicable to various architectures including convolutional, residual and recurrent networks. Unlike existing methods, our approach enables us to demonstrate that the retained connections are indeed relevant to the given task.	8	171	2	0	37	6.046783625730995
01	 Current end-to-end machine reading and question answering (Q\&A) models are primarily based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with attention. Despite their success, these models are often slow for both training and inference due to the sequential nature of RNNs. We propose a new Q\&A architecture called QANet, which does not require recurrent networks:  Its encoder consists exclusively of convolution and self-attention, where convolution models local interactions and self-attention models global interactions. On the SQuAD dataset, our model is 3x to 13x faster in training and 4x to 9x faster in inference, while achieving equivalent accuracy to recurrent models. The speed-up gain allows us to train the model with much more data. We hence combine our model with data generated by backtranslation from a neural machine translation model. On the SQuAD dataset, our single model, trained with augmented data, achieves 84.6 F1 score on the test set, which is significantly better than the best published F1 score of 81.8.	10	158	6	0	18	5.5
10	Neural networks make mistakes. The reason why a mistake is made often remains a mystery. As such neural networks often are considered a black box. It would be useful to have a method that can give an explanation that is intuitive to a user as to why an image is misclassified. In this paper we develop a method for explaining the mistakes of a classifier model by visually showing what must be added to an image such that it is correctly classified. Our work combines the fields of adversarial examples, generative modeling and a correction technique based on difference target propagation to create an technique that creates explanations of why an image is misclassified. In this paper we explain our method and demonstrate it on MNIST and CelebA. This approach could aid in demystifying neural networks for a user.	10	139	7	0	12	4.877697841726619
10	Knowledge distillation is a potential solution for model compression. The idea is to make a small student network imitate the target of a large teacher network, then the student network can be competitive to the teacher one. Most previous studies focus on model distillation in the classification task, where they propose different architectures and initializations for the student network. However, only the classification task is not enough, and other related tasks such as regression and retrieval are barely considered. To solve the problem, in this paper, we take face recognition as a breaking point and propose model distillation with knowledge transfer from face classification to alignment and verification. By selecting appropriate initializations and targets in the knowledge transfer, the distillation can be easier in non-classification tasks. Experiments on the CelebA and CASIA-WebFace datasets demonstrate that the student network can be competitive to the teacher one in alignment and verification, and even surpasses the teacher network under specific compression rates. In addition, to achieve stronger knowledge transfer, we also use a common initialization trick to improve the distillation performance of classification. Evaluations on the CASIA-Webface and large-scale MS-Celeb-1M datasets show the effectiveness of this simple trick.	12	195	5	0	22	5.964102564102564
10	Mixed-precision arithmetic combining both single- and half-precision operands in the same operation have been successfully applied to train deep neural networks. Despite the advantages of mixed-precision arithmetic in terms of reducing the need for key resources like memory bandwidth or register file size, it has a limited capacity for diminishing computing costs and requires 32 bits to represent its output operands. This paper proposes two approaches to replace mixed-precision for half-precision arithmetic during a large portion of the training. The first approach achieves accuracy ratios slightly slower than the state-of-the-art by using half-precision arithmetic during more than 99% of training. The second approach reaches the same accuracy as the state-of-the-art by dynamically switching between half- and mixed-precision arithmetic during training. It uses half-precision during more than 94% of the training process. This paper is the first in demonstrating that half-precision can be used for a very large portion of DNNs training and still reach state-of-the-art accuracy.	8	156	6	1	8	6.0
01	We present a deep generative model for unsupervised text style transfer that unifies previously proposed non-generative techniques. Our probabilistic approach models non-parallel data from two domains as a partially observed parallel corpus. By hypothesizing a parallel latent sequence that generates each observed sequence, our model learns to transform sequences from one domain to another in a completely unsupervised fashion. In contrast with traditional generative sequence models (e.g. the HMM), our model makes few assumptions about the data it generates: it uses a recurrent language model as a prior and an encoder-decoder as a transduction distribution. While computation of marginal data likelihood is intractable in this model class, we show that amortized variational inference admits a practical surrogate. Further, by drawing connections between our variational objective and other recent unsupervised style transfer and machine translation techniques, we show how our probabilistic view can unify some known non-generative objectives such as backtranslation and adversarial loss. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of unsupervised style transfer tasks, including sentiment transfer, formality transfer, word decipherment, author imitation, and related language translation. Across all style transfer tasks, our approach yields substantial gains over state-of-the-art non-generative baselines, including the state-of-the-art unsupervised machine translation techniques that our approach generalizes. Further, we conduct experiments on a standard unsupervised machine translation task and find that our unified approach matches the current state-of-the-art.	8	229	2	0	26	6.462882096069869
10	Neural inductive program synthesis is a task generating instructions that can produce desired outputs from given inputs. In this paper, we focus on the generation of a chunk of assembly code that can be executed to match a state change inside the CPU. We develop a neural program synthesis algorithm, AutoAssemblet, learned via self-learning reinforcement learning that explores the large code space efficiently. Policy networks and value networks are learned to reduce the breadth and depth of the Monte Carlo Tree Search, resulting in better synthesis performance.  We also propose an effective multi-entropy policy sampling technique to alleviate online update correlations.  We apply AutoAssemblet to basic programming tasks and show significant higher success rates compared to several competing baselines.	5	119	4	0	22	5.80672268907563
10	Developing deep neural networks (DNNs) for manifold-valued data setshas gained much interest of late in the deep learning researchcommunity.  Examples of manifold-valued data include data fromomnidirectional cameras on automobiles, drones etc., diffusionmagnetic resonance imaging, elastography and others. In this paper, wepresent a novel theoretical framework for DNNs to cope withmanifold-valued data inputs.  In doing this generalization, we drawparallels to the widely popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs).We call our network the ManifoldNet.As in vector spaces where convolutions are equivalent to computing theweighted mean of functions, an analogous definition formanifold-valued data can be constructed involving the computation ofthe weighted Fr\'{e}chet Mean (wFM). To this end, we present aprovably convergent recursive computation of the wFM of the givendata, where the weights makeup the convolution mask, to belearned. Further, we prove that the proposed wFM layer achieves acontraction mapping and hence the ManifoldNet does not need theadditional non-linear ReLU unit used in standard CNNs. Operations suchas pooling in traditional CNN are no longer necessary in this settingsince wFM is already a pooling type operation. Analogous to theequivariance of convolution in Euclidean space to translations, weprove that the wFM is equivariant to the action of the group ofisometries admitted by the Riemannian manifold on which the datareside. This equivariance property facilitates weight sharing withinthe network.  We present experiments, using the ManifoldNet framework,to achieve video classification and image reconstruction using anauto-encoder+decoder setting. Experimental results demonstrate theefficacy of ManifoldNet in the context of classification andreconstruction accuracy.	8	267	0	0	0	5.872659176029963
01	Ensembles of models often yield improvements in system performance. These ensemble approaches have also been empirically shown to yield robust measures of uncertainty, and are capable of distinguishing between different forms of uncertainty. However, ensembles come at a computational and memory cost which may be prohibitive for many applications. There has been significant work done on the distillation of an ensemble into a single model. Such approaches decrease computational cost and allow a single model to achieve an accuracy comparable to that of an ensemble. However, information about the diversity of the ensemble, which can yield estimates of different forms of uncertainty, is lost. This work considers the novel task of Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EnD^2) - distilling the distribution of the predictions from an ensemble, rather than just the average prediction, into a single model. EnD^2 enables a single model to retain both the improved classification performance of ensemble distillation as well as information about the diversity of the ensemble, which is useful for uncertainty estimation. A solution for EnD^2 based on Prior Networks, a class of models which allow a single neural network to explicitly model a distribution over output distributions, is proposed in this work. The properties of EnD^2 are investigated on both an artificial dataset, and on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet datasets, where it is shown that EnD^2 can approach the classification performance of an ensemble, and outperforms both standard DNNs and Ensemble Distillation on the tasks of misclassification and out-of-distribution input detection.	3	247	4	0	30	5.7327935222672055
10	An object can be described as the combination of primary visual attributes. Disentangling such underlying primitives is the long objective of representation learning. It is observed that categories have the natural multi-granularity or hierarchical characteristics, i.e. any two objects can share some common primitives in a particular category granularity while they may possess their unique ones in another granularity. However, previous works usually operate in a flat manner (i.e. in a particular granularity) to disentangle the representations of objects. Though they may obtain the primitives to constitute objects as the categories in that granularity, their results are obviously not efficient and complete. In this paper, we propose the hierarchical disentangle network (HDN) to exploit the rich hierarchical characteristics among categories to divide the disentangling process in a coarse-to-fine manner, such that each level only focuses on learning the specific representations in its granularity and finally the common and unique representations in all granularities jointly constitute the raw object. Specifically, HDN is designed based on an encoder-decoder architecture. To simultaneously ensure the disentanglement and interpretability of the encoded representations, a novel hierarchical generative adversarial network (GAN) is elaborately designed. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on four object datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.	7	202	0	0	9	6.301980198019803
10	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly trained using a fixed spatial image size predetermined for a given model. Although trained on images of a specific size, it is well established that CNNs can be used to evaluate a wide range of image sizes at test time, by adjusting the size of intermediate feature maps. In this work, we describe and evaluate a novel mixed-size training regime that mixes several image sizes at training time. We demonstrate that models trained using our method are more resilient to image size changes and generalize well even on small images. This allows faster inference by using smaller images at test time. For instance, we receive a 76.43% top-1 accuracy using ResNet50 with an image size of 160, which matches the accuracy of the baseline model with 2x fewer computations.Furthermore, for a given image size used at test time, we show this method can be exploited either to accelerate training or the final test accuracy. For example, we are able to reach a 79.27% accuracy with a model evaluated at a 288 spatial size for a relative improvement of 14% over the baseline.	16	189	2	1	14	4.8994708994709
10	Natural intelligent agents learn to perceive the three dimensional structure of the world without training on large datasets and are unlikely to have the precise equations of projective geometry hard-wired in the brain. Such skill would also be  valuable  to  artificial  systems  in  order  to  avoid  the  expensive  collection  of labeled datasets, as well as tedious tuning required by methods based on multi-view geometry. Inspired by natural agents, who interact with the environment via visual and haptic feedback, this paper explores a new approach to learning depth from images and very sparse depth measurements, just a few pixels per image. To learn from such extremely sparse supervision, we introduce an appropriate inductive bias by designing a specialized global-local network architecture. Experiments on several datasets show that the proposed model can learn monocular dense depth estimation when trained with very sparse ground truth, even a single pixel per image. Moreover, we find that the global parameters extracted by the network are predictive of the metric agent motion.	9	166	3	0	9	5.542168674698795
10	The goal of survival clustering is to map subjects (e.g., users in a social network, patients in a medical study) to $K$ clusters ranging from low-risk to high-risk. Existing survival methods assume the presence of clear \textit{end-of-life} signals or introduce them artificially using a pre-defined timeout. In this paper, we forego this assumption and introduce a loss function that differentiates between the empirical lifetime distributions of the clusters using a modified Kuiper statistic. We learn a deep neural network by optimizing this loss, that performs a soft clustering of users into survival groups. We apply our method to a social network dataset with over 1M subjects, and show significant improvement in C-index compared to alternatives.	10	115	3	0	34	5.582608695652174
10	Deep networks face challenges of ensuring their robustness against inputs that cannot be effectively represented by information learned from training data. We attribute this vulnerability to the limitations inherent to activation-based representation. To complement the learned information from activation-based representation, we propose utilizing a gradient-based representation that explicitly focuses on missing information. In addition, we propose a directional constraint on the gradients as an objective during training to improve the characterization of missing information. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we compare the anomaly detection performance of gradient-based and activation-based representations. We show that the gradient-based representation outperforms the activation-based representation by 0.093 in CIFAR-10 and 0.361 in CURE-TSR datasets in terms of AUROC averaged over all classes. Also, we propose an anomaly detection algorithm that uses the gradient-based representation, denoted as GradCon, and validate its performance on three benchmarking datasets. The proposed method outperforms the majority of the state-of-the-art algorithms in CIFAR-10, MNIST, and fMNIST datasets with an average AUROC of 0.664, 0.973, and 0.934, respectively.	9	169	3	0	14	6.633136094674557
01	We propose a novel framework to adaptively adjust the dropout rates for the deep neural network based on a Rademacher complexity bound. The state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms impose dropout strategy to prevent feature co-adaptation. However, choosing the dropout rates remains an art of heuristics or relies on empirical grid-search over some hyperparameter space. In this work, we show the network Rademacher complexity is bounded by a function related to the dropout rate vectors and the weight coefficient matrices. Subsequently, we impose this bound as a regularizer and provide a theoretical justified way to trade-off between model complexity and representation power. Therefore, the dropout rates and the empirical loss are unified into the same objective function, which is then optimized using the block coordinate descent algorithm. We discover that the adaptively adjusted dropout rates converge to some interesting distributions that reveal meaningful patterns.Experiments on the task of image and document classification also show our method achieves better performance compared to the state-of the-art dropout algorithms.	6	164	5	0	22	5.969512195121951
10	This paper presents the Variation Network (VarNet), a  generative model providing means to manipulate the high-level attributes of a given input. The originality of our approach is that VarNet is not only capable of handling pre-defined attributes but can also learn the relevant attributes of the dataset by itself.  These two settings can be easily combined  which makes VarNet applicable for a wide variety of tasks. Further, VarNet has a sound probabilistic interpretation which grants us with  a novel way to navigate in the latent spaces as well as means to control how the  attributes are learned. We demonstrate  experimentally that this model is capable of performing interesting input manipulation  and that the learned attributes are relevant and interpretable.	9	119	4	0	23	5.436974789915967
01	We present NeuroSAT, a message passing neural network that learns to solve SAT problems after only being trained as a classifier to predict satisfiability.  Although it is not competitive with state-of-the-art SAT solvers, NeuroSAT can solve problems that are substantially larger and more difficult than it ever saw during training by simply running for more iterations. Moreover, NeuroSAT generalizes to novel distributions; after training only on random SAT problems, at test time it can solve SAT problems encoding graph coloring, clique detection, dominating set, and vertex cover problems, all on a range of distributions over small random graphs.	7	98	5	0	30	5.66326530612245
10	Auto-encoders are commonly used for unsupervised representation learning and for pre-training deeper neural networks.When its activation function is linear and the encoding dimension (width of hidden layer) is smaller than the input dimension, it is well known that auto-encoder is optimized to learn the principal components of the data distribution (Oja1982).However, when the activation is nonlinear and when the width is larger than the input dimension (overcomplete), auto-encoder behaves differently from PCA, and in fact is known to perform well empirically for sparse coding problems. We provide a theoretical explanation for this empirically observed phenomenon, when rectified-linear unit (ReLu) is adopted as the activation function and the hidden-layer width is set to be large.In this case, we show that, with significant probability, initializing the weight matrix of an auto-encoder by sampling from a spherical Gaussian distribution followed by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training converges towards the ground-truth representation for a class of sparse dictionary learning models.In addition, we can show that, conditioning on convergence, the expected convergence rate is O(1/t), where t is the number of updates.Our analysis quantifies how increasing hidden layer width helps the training performance when random initialization is used, and how the norm of network weights influence the speed of SGD convergence. 	13	211	5	0	6	5.838862559241706
10	We propose a novel attention mechanism to enhance Convolutional Neural Networks for fine-grained recognition. The proposed mechanism reuses CNN feature activations to find the most informative parts of the image at different depths with the help of gating mechanisms and without part annotations. Thus, it can be used to augment any layer of a CNN to extract low- and high-level local information to be more discriminative. Differently, from other approaches, the mechanism we propose just needs a single pass through the input and it can be trained end-to-end through SGD. As a consequence, the proposed mechanism is modular, architecture-independent, easy to implement, and faster than iterative approaches.Experiments show that, when augmented with our approach, Wide Residual Networks systematically achieve superior performance on each of five different fine-grained recognition datasets: the Adience age and gender recognition benchmark, Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, Stanford Cars, and UEC Food-100, obtaining competitive and state-of-the-art scores.	8	151	4	0	18	6.105960264900662
10	To construct representations for natural language sequences, information from two main sources needs to be captured: (i) semantic meaning of individual words, and (ii) their compositionality. These two types of information are usually represented in the form of word embeddings and compositional functions, respectively. For the latter, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been considered. There has not been a rigorous evaluation regarding the relative importance of each component to different text-representation-based tasks; i.e., how important is the modeling capacity of word embeddings alone, relative to the added value of a compositional function? In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparative study between Simple Word Embeddings-based Models (SWEMs), with no compositional parameters, relative to employing word embeddings within RNN/CNN-based models. Surprisingly, SWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered. Moreover, in a new SWEM setup, we propose to employ a max-pooling operation over the learned word-embedding matrix of a given sentence. This approach is demonstrated to extract complementary features relative to the averaging operation standard to SWEMs, while endowing our model with better interpretability. To further validate our observations, we examine the information utilized by different models to make predictions, revealing interesting properties of word embeddings.	12	205	2	0	0	6.287804878048781
01	Large deep neural networks are powerful, but exhibit undesirable behaviors such as memorization and sensitivity to adversarial examples. In this work, we propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels.  By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples.  Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures.  We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt labels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the training of generative adversarial networks.	5	113	8	0	17	6.1504424778761075
10	Word embeddings extract semantic features of words from large datasets of text.Most embedding methods rely on a log-bilinear model to predict the occurrenceof a word in a context of other words. Here we propose word2net, a method thatreplaces their linear parametrization with neural networks. For each term in thevocabulary, word2net posits a neural network that takes the context as input andoutputs a probability of occurrence. Further, word2net can use the hierarchicalorganization of its word networks to incorporate additional meta-data, such assyntactic features, into the embedding model. For example, we show how to shareparameters across word networks to develop an embedding model that includespart-of-speech information. We study word2net with two datasets, a collectionof Wikipedia articles and a corpus of U.S. Senate speeches. Quantitatively, wefound that word2net outperforms popular embedding methods on predicting held-out words and that sharing parameters based on part of speech further boostsperformance. Qualitatively, word2net learns interpretable semantic representationsand, compared to vector-based methods, better incorporates syntactic information.	5	172	3	0	22	5.924418604651162
01	Efficient audio synthesis is an inherently difficult machine learning task, as human perception is sensitive to both global structure and fine-scale waveform coherence. Autoregressive models, such as WaveNet, model local structure at the expense of global latent structure and slow iterative sampling, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have global latent conditioning and efficient parallel sampling, but struggle to generate locally-coherent audio waveforms. Herein, we demonstrate that GANs can in fact generate high-fidelity and locally-coherent audio by modeling log magnitudes and instantaneous frequencies  with sufficient frequency resolution in the spectral domain. Through extensive empirical investigations on the NSynth dataset, we demonstrate that GANs are able to outperform strong WaveNet baselines on automated and human evaluation metrics, and efficiently generate audio several orders of magnitude faster than their autoregressive counterparts.	5	128	5	0	5	6.6015625
01	The notion of the stationary equilibrium ensemble has played a central role in statistical mechanics. In machine learning as well, training serves as generalized equilibration that drives the probability distribution of model parameters toward stationarity. Here, we derive stationary fluctuation-dissipation relations that link measurable quantities and hyperparameters in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. These relations hold exactly for any stationary state and can in particular be used to adaptively set training schedule. We can further use the relations to efficiently extract information pertaining to a loss-function landscape such as the magnitudes of its Hessian and anharmonicity. Our claims are empirically verified.	6	101	4	0	21	6.326732673267328
10	"While neural networks can be trained to map from one specific dataset to another, they usually do not learn a generalized transformation that can extrapolate accurately outside the space of training. For instance, a generative adversarial network (GAN) exclusively trained to transform images of cars from light to dark might not have the same effect on images of horses. This is because neural networks are good at generation within the manifold of the data that they are trained on. However, generating new samples outside of the manifold or extrapolating ""out-of-sample"" is a much harder problem that has been less well studied. To address this, we introduce a technique called neuron editing that learns how neurons encode an edit for a particular transformation in a latent space. We use an autoencoder to decompose the variation within the dataset into activations of different neurons and generate transformed data by defining an editing transformation on those neurons. By performing the transformation in a latent trained space, we encode fairly complex and non-linear transformations to the data with much simpler distribution shifts to the neuron's activations. We showcase our technique on image domain/style transfer and two biological applications: removal of batch artifacts representing unwanted noise and modeling the effect of drug treatments to predict synergy between drugs."	5	213	7	0	20	5.549295774647887
10	To extract and relate visual and linguistic concepts from images and textual descriptions for text-based zero-shot learning (ZSL), we develop variational hetero-encoder (VHE) that decodes text via a deep probabilisitic topic model, the variational posterior of whose local latent variables is encoded from an image via a Weibull distribution based inference network. To further improve VHE and add an image generator, we propose VHE randomized generative adversarial net (VHEGAN) that exploits the synergy between VHE and GAN through their shared latent space. After training with a hybrid stochastic-gradient MCMC/variational inference/stochastic gradient descent inference algorithm, VHEGAN can be used in a variety of settings, such as text generation/retrieval conditioning on an image, image generation/retrieval conditioning on a document/image, and generation of text-image pairs. The efficacy of VHEGAN is demonstrated quantitatively with experiments on both conventional and generalized ZSL tasks, and qualitatively on (conditional) image and/or text generation/retrieval.	8	146	5	0	0	6.410958904109589
10	We consider the problem of learning high-level controls over the global structure of sequence generation, particularly in the context of symbolic music generation with complex language models. In this work, we present the Transformer autoencoder, which aggregates encodings of the input data across time to obtain a global representation of style from a given performance.  We show it is possible to combine this global embedding with other temporally distributed embeddings, enabling improved control over the separate aspects of performance style and  and melody. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of music generation tasks on the MAESTRO dataset and an internal, 10,000+ hour dataset of piano performances, where we achieve improvements in terms of log-likelihood and mean listening scores as compared to relevant baselines.	6	128	3	0	0	5.7578125
10	Nowadays, machine learning models are becoming a utility in many sectors. AI companies deliver pre-trained encapsulated models as application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers can combine with third party components, their models, and proprietary data, to create complex data products. This complexity and the lack of control and knowledge of the internals of these external components might cause unavoidable effects, such as lack of transparency, difficulty in auditability, and the emergence of uncontrolled potential risks. These issues are especially critical when practitioners use these components as black-boxes in new datasets. In order to provide actionable insights in this type of scenarios, in this work we propose the use of a wrapping deep learning model to enrich the output of a classification black-box with a measure of uncertainty. Given a black-box classifier, we propose a probabilistic neural network that works in parallel to the black-box and uses a Dirichlet layer as the fusion layer with the black-box.  This Dirichlet layer yields a distribution on top of the multinomial output parameters of the classifier and enables the estimation of aleatoric uncertainty for any data sample.  Based on the resulting uncertainty measure, we advocate for a rejection system that selects the more confident predictions, discarding those more uncertain, leading to an improvement in the trustability of the resulting system. We showcase the proposed technique and methodology in two practical scenarios, one for NLP and another for computer vision, where a simulated API based is applied to different domains. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the uncertainty computed by the wrapper and its high correlation to wrong predictions and misclassifications.	9	265	6	1	22	5.735849056603772
10	We introduce Explainable Adversarial Learning, ExL, an approach for training neural networks that are intrinsically robust to adversarial attacks. We find that the implicit generative modeling of random noise with the same loss function used during posterior maximization, improves a model's understanding of the data manifold furthering adversarial robustness. We prove our approach's efficacy and provide a simplistic visualization tool for understanding adversarial data, using Principal Component Analysis. Our analysis reveals that adversarial robustness, in general, manifests in models with higher variance along the high-ranked principal components. We show that models learnt with our approach perform remarkably well against a wide-range of attacks. Furthermore, combining ExL with state-of-the-art adversarial training extends the robustness of a model, even beyond what it is adversarially trained for, in both white-box and black-box attack scenarios.	14	131	6	0	19	6.366412213740458
10	Regularization is known to be an inexpensive and reasonable solution to alleviate over-fitting problems of inference models, including deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical regularization which preserves the semantic structure of a sample distribution. At the same time, this regularization promotes diversity by imposing distance between parameter vectors enlarged within semantic structures. To generate evenly distributed parameters, we constrain them to lie on \emph{hierarchical hyperspheres}. Evenly distributed parameters are considered to be less redundant. To define hierarchical parameter space, we propose to reformulate the topology space with multiple hypersphere space. On each hypersphere space, the projection parameter is defined by two individual parameters. Since maximizing groupwise pairwise distance between points on hypersphere is nontrivial (generalized Thomson problem), we propose a new discrete metric integrated with continuous angle metric. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CUB200-2011, and Stanford Cars), our proposed method shows improved generalization performance,  especially when the number of super-classes is larger.	4	159	0	0	0	6.685534591194968
10	To continuously improve quality and reflect changes in data, machine learning-based services have to regularly re-train and update their core models. In the setting of language models, we show that a comparative analysis of model snapshots before and after an update can reveal a surprising amount of detailed information about the changes in the data used for training before and after the update.We discuss the privacy implications of our findings, propose mitigation strategies and evaluate their effect.	9	78	2	0	13	5.5256410256410255
10	We develop the Y-learner for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. The Y-learner is designed to leverage the abilities of neural networks to optimize multiple objectives and continually update, which allows for better pooling of underlying feature information between treatment and control groups. We evaluate the Y-learner on three test problems: (1) A set of six simulated data benchmarks from the literature. (2) A real-world large-scale experiment on voter persuasion. (3) A task from the literature that estimates artificially generated treatment effects on MNIST didgits. The Y-learner achieves state of the art results on two of the three tasks. On the MNIST task, it gets the second best results. 	10	112	4	0	17	5.723214285714287
10	    With the proliferation of models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, it is even harder to understand the differences between models and their relative merits. Simply looking at differences between holistic metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or F1 do not tell us \emph{why} or \emph{how} a particular method is better and how dataset biases influence the choices of model design.    In this paper, we present a general methodology for {\emph{interpretable}} evaluation of NLP systems and choose the task of named entity recognition (NER) as a case study, which is a core task of identifying people, places, or organizations in text. The proposed evaluation method enables us to interpret the \textit{model biases}, \textit{dataset biases}, and how the \emph{differences in the datasets} affect the design of the models, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. By making our {analysis} tool available, we make it easy for future researchers to run similar analyses and drive the progress in this area.	10	158	4	0	15	5.5
10	Proteins are ubiquitous molecules whose function in biological processes is determined by their 3D structure.Experimental identification of a protein's structure can be time-consuming, prohibitively expensive, and not always possible. Alternatively, protein folding can be modeled using computational methods, which however are not guaranteed to always produce optimal results.GraphQA is a graph-based method to estimate the quality of protein models, that possesses favorable properties such as representation learning, explicit modeling of both sequential and 3D structure, geometric invariance and computational efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate significant improvements of the state-of-the-art for both hand-engineered and representation-learning approaches, as well as carefully evaluating the individual contributions of GraphQA.	9	108	3	1	19	6.824074074074074
10	Collaborative personalization, such as through learned user representations (embeddings), can improve the prediction accuracy of neural-network-based models significantly. We propose Federated User Representation Learning (FURL), a simple, scalable, privacy-preserving and resource-efficient way to utilize existing neural personalization techniques in the Federated Learning (FL) setting. FURL divides model parameters into federated and private parameters. Private parameters, such as private user embeddings, are trained locally, but unlike federated parameters, they are not transferred to or averaged on the server. We show theoretically that this parameter split does not affect training for most model personalization approaches. Storing user embeddings locally not only preserves user privacy, but also improves memory locality of personalization compared to on-server training. We evaluate FURL on two datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement in model quality with 8% and 51% performance increases, and approximately the same level of performance as centralized training with only 0% and 4% reductions. Furthermore, we show that user embeddings learned in FL and the centralized setting have a very similar structure, indicating that FURL can learn collaboratively through the shared parameters while preserving user privacy.	4	180	4	0	26	6.466666666666668
01	Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are an expressive class of neural generative models with tremendous success in modeling high-dimensional continuous measures. In this paper, we present a scalable method for unbalanced optimal transport (OT) based on the generative-adversarial framework. We formulate unbalanced OT as a problem of simultaneously learning a transport map and a scaling factor that push a source measure to a target measure in a cost-optimal manner. We provide theoretical justification for this formulation, showing that it is closely related to an existing static formulation by Liero et al. (2018). We then propose an algorithm for solving this problem based on stochastic alternating gradient updates, similar in practice to GANs, and perform numerical experiments demonstrating how this methodology can be applied to population modeling.	8	125	3	0	12	5.912000000000001
01	Reinforcement learning algorithms use correlations between policies and rewards to improve agent performance.   But in dynamic or sparsely rewarding environments these correlations are often too small,  or rewarding events are too infrequent to make learning feasible. Human education instead relies on curricula –the breakdown of tasks into simpler, static challenges with dense rewards– to build up to complex behaviors.  While curricula are also useful for artificial agents, hand-crafting them is time consuming.  This has lead researchers to explore automatic curriculum generation. Here we explore automatic curriculum generation in rich,dynamic environments.  Using a setter-solver paradigm we show the importance of considering goal validity, goal feasibility, and goal coverage to construct useful curricula.  We demonstrate the success of our approach in rich but sparsely rewarding 2D and 3D environments, where an agent is tasked to achieve a single goal selected from a set of possible goals that varies between episodes, and identify challenges for future work.  Finally, we demonstrate the value of a novel technique that guides agents towards a desired goal distribution. Altogether, these results represent a substantial step towards applying automatic task curricula to learn complex,  otherwise unlearnable goals,  and to our knowledge are the first to demonstrate automated curriculum generation for goal-conditioned agents in environments where the possible goals vary between episodes.	6	213	2	0	20	6.032863849765258
10	Deep learning, a rebranding of deep neural network research works, has achieved a remarkable success in recent years. With multiple hidden layers, deep learning models aim at computing the hierarchical feature representations of the observational data. Meanwhile, due to its severe disadvantages in data consumption, computational resources, parameter tuning costs and the lack of result explainability, deep learning has also suffered from lots of criticism. In this paper, we will introduce a new representation learning model, namely “Sample-Ensemble Genetic Evolutionary Network” (SEGEN), which can serve as an alternative approach to deep learning models. Instead of building one single deep model, based on a set of sampled sub-instances, SEGEN adopts a genetic-evolutionary learning strategy to build a group of unit models generations by generations. The unit models incorporated in SEGEN can be either traditional machine learning models or the recent deep learning models with a much “narrower” and “shallower” architecture. The learning results of each instance at the final generation will be effectively combined from each unit model via diffusive propagation and ensemble learning strategies. From the computational perspective, SEGEN requires far less data, fewer computational resources and parameter tuning efforts, but has sound theoretic interpretability of the learning process and results. Extensive experiments have been done on several different real-world benchmark datasets, and the experimental results obtained by SEGEN have demonstrated its advantages over the state-of-the-art representation learning models.	6	229	5	0	24	6.152838427947597
10	Meta-learning methods, most notably Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (Finn et al, 2017) or MAML, have achieved great success in adapting to new tasks quickly, after having been trained on similar tasks.The mechanism behind their success, however, is poorly understood.We begin this work with an experimental analysis of MAML, finding that deep models are crucial for its success, even given sets of simple tasks where a linear model would suffice on any individual task.Furthermore, on image-recognition tasks, we find that the early layers of MAML-trained models learn task-invariant features, while later layers are used for adaptation, providing further evidence that these models require greater capacity than is strictly necessary for their individual tasks.Following our findings, we propose a method which enables better use of model capacity at inference time by separating the adaptation aspect of meta-learning into parameters that are only used for adaptation but are not part of the forward model.We find that our approach enables more effective meta-learning in smaller models, which are suitably sized for the individual tasks.	9	173	5	0	22	5.606936416184971
10	"Recent studies on catastrophic forgetting during sequential learning typically focus on fixing the accuracy of the predictions for a previously learned task. In this paper we argue that the outputs of neural networks are subject to rapid changes when learning a new data distribution, and networks that appear to ""forget"" everything still contain useful representation towards previous tasks. We thus propose to enforce the output accuracy to stay the same, we should aim to reduce the effect of catastrophic forgetting on the representation level, as the output layer can be quickly recovered later with a small number of examples. Towards this goal, we propose an experimental setup that measures the amount of representational forgetting, and develop a novel meta-learning algorithm to overcome this issue. The proposed meta-learner produces weight updates of a sequential learning network,  mimicking a multi-task teacher network's representation. We show that our meta-learner can improve its learned representations on new tasks, while maintaining a good representation for old tasks."	7	162	3	0	10	5.728395061728394
10	We investigate neural network training and generalization using the concept of stiffness. We measure how stiff a network is by looking at how a small gradient step on one example affects the loss on another example. In particular, we study how stiffness depends on 1) class membership, 2) distance between data points in the input space, 3) training iteration, and 4) learning rate. We experiment on MNIST, FASHION MNIST, and CIFAR-10 using fully-connected and convolutional neural networks. Our results demonstrate that stiffness is a useful concept for diagnosing and characterizing generalization. We observe that small learning rates reliably lead to higher stiffness at a given epoch as well as at a given training loss. In addition, we measure how stiffness between two data points depends on their mutual input-space distance, and establish the concept of a dynamical critical length that characterizes the distance over which datapoints react similarly to gradient updates. The dynamical critical length decreases with training and the higher the learning rate, the smaller the critical length.	9	169	3	0	36	5.526627218934912
10	In this paper we study the problem of learning the weights of a deep convolutional neural network. We consider a network where convolutions are carried out over non-overlapping patches with a single kernel in each layer. We develop an algorithm for simultaneously learning all the kernels from the training data. Our approach dubbed Deep Tensor Decomposition (DeepTD) is based on a rank-1 tensor decomposition. We theoretically investigate DeepTD under a realizable model for the training data where the inputs are chosen i.i.d. from a Gaussian distribution and the labels are generated according to planted convolutional kernels. We show that DeepTD is data-efficient and provably works as soon as the sample size exceeds the total number of convolutional weights in the network. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepTD and verify our theoretical findings.	11	134	4	0	28	5.5970149253731325
10	Regularization-based continual learning approaches generally prevent catastrophic forgetting by augmenting the training loss with an auxiliary objective. However in most practical optimization scenarios with noisy data and/or gradients, it is possible that stochastic gradient descent can inadvertently change critical parameters.In this paper, we argue for the importance of regularizing optimization trajectories directly. We derive a new co-natural gradient update rule for continual learning whereby the new task gradients are preconditioned with the empirical Fisher information of previously learnt tasks. We show that using the co-natural gradient systematically reduces forgetting in continual learning. Moreover, it helps combat overfitting when learning a new task in a low resource scenario.	6	108	4	0	15	6.4444444444444455
10	In the application of machine learning to remote sensing, labeled data is often scarce or expensive, which impedes the training of powerful models like deep convolutional neural networks. Although unlabeled data is abundant, recent self-supervised learning approaches are ill-suited to the remote sensing domain. In addition, most remote sensing applications currently use only a small subset of the multi-sensor, multi-channel information available, motivating the need for fused multi-sensor representations. We propose a new self-supervised training objective, Contrastive Sensor Fusion, which exploits coterminous data from multiple sources to learn useful representations of every possible combination of those sources. This method uses information common across multiple sensors and bands by training a single model to produce a representation that remains similar when any subset of its input channels is used. Using a dataset of 47 million unlabeled coterminous image triplets, we train an encoder to produce semantically meaningful representations from any possible combination of channels from the input sensors. These representations outperform fully supervised ImageNet weights on a remote sensing classification task and improve as more sensors are fused.	10	177	5	1	17	6.1694915254237275
10	Domain adaptation is an open problem in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Often, agents are asked to perform in environments where data is difficult to obtain. In such settings, agents are trained in similar environments, such as simulators, and are then transferred to the original environment. The gap between visual observations of the source and target environments often causes the agent to fail in the target environment. We present a new RL agent, SADALA (Soft Attention DisentAngled representation Learning Agent). SADALA first learns a compressed state representation. It then jointly learns to ignore distracting features and solve the task presented. SADALA's separation of important and unimportant visual features leads to robust domain transfer. SADALA outperforms both prior disentangled-representation based RL and domain randomization approaches across RL environments (Visual Cartpole and DeepMind Lab).	6	131	6	1	30	6.0381679389312986

Through this work we make two main contributions a) Theability to condition latent representations while generating realistic speech samplesb) The ability to efficiently generate long speech samples by using a novellatent variable transformation module that is trained using policy gradients. Previousmethods are limited in being able to generate only relatively short samplesor are not very efficient at generating long samples. The generated speech samplesare validated through a number of various evaluation measures viz, a WGANcritic loss and through subjective scores on user evaluations against competitivespeech synthesis baselines and detailed ablation analysis of the proposed model.The evaluations demonstrate that the model generates realistic long speech samplesconditioned on accent efficiently.	9	132	11	0	0	5.954545454545454

10	The field of deep learning has been craving for an optimization method that shows outstanding property for both optimization and generalization.  We propose a method for mathematical optimization based on flows along geodesics, that is, the shortest paths between two points, with respect to the Riemannian metric induced by a non-linear function. In our method, the flows refer to Exponentially Decaying Flows (EDF), as they can be designed to converge on the local solutions exponentially. In this paper, we conduct experiments to show its high performance on optimization benchmarks (i.e., convergence properties), as well as its potential for producing good machine learning benchmarks (i.e., generalization properties).	8	106	2	0	12	5.830188679245283
10	Sparse neural networks have been shown to yield computationally efficient networks with improved inference times.  There is a large body of work on training dense networks to yield sparse networks for inference (Molchanov et al., 2017;Zhu & Gupta, 2018; Louizos et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2016).  This limits the size of the largest trainable sparse model to that of the largest trainable dense model. In this paper we introduce a method to train sparse neural networks with a fixed parameter count and a fixed computational cost throughout training, without sacrificing accuracy relative to existing dense-to-sparse training methods. Our method updates the topology of the network during training by using parameter magnitudes and infrequent gradient calculations. We show that this approach requires less floating-point operations (FLOPs) to achieve a given level of accuracy compared to prior techniques. We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results with ResNet-50, MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 on the ImageNet-2012 dataset. Finally,  we  provide  some  insights  into  why  allowing  the  topology  to change during the optimization can overcome local minima encountered when the topology remains static.	7	183	10	1	17	5.693989071038251
01	Progress in probabilistic generative models has accelerated, developing richer models with neural architectures, implicit densities, and with scalable algorithms for their Bayesian inference. However, there has been limited progress in models that capture causal relationships, for example, how individual genetic factors cause major human diseases. In this work, we focus on two challenges in particular: How do we build richer causal models, which can capture highly nonlinear relationships and interactions between multiple causes? How do we adjust for latent confounders, which are variables influencing both cause and effect and which prevent learning of causal relationships? To address these challenges, we synthesize ideas from causality and modern probabilistic modeling. For the first, we describe implicit causal models, a class of causal models that leverages neural architectures with an implicit density. For the second, we describe an implicit causal model that adjusts for confounders by sharing strength across examples. In experiments, we scale Bayesian inference on up to a billion genetic measurements. We achieve state of the art accuracy for identifying causal factors: we significantly outperform the second best result by an absolute difference of 15-45.3%.	7	184	0	0	7	5.967391304347826
10	Learning disentangled representations of  data is one of the central themes in unsupervised learning in general and generative modelling in particular.  In this work,  we tackle a slightly more intricate scenario where the observations are generated from a conditional distribution of some known control variate and some latent noise variate.  To this end, we present a hierarchical model and a training method (CZ-GEM) that leverages some of the recent developments in likelihood-based and likelihood-free generative models.  We show that by formulation, CZ-GEM introduces the right inductive biases that ensure the disentanglement of the control from the noise variables, while also keeping the components of the control variate disentangled. This is achieved without compromising on the quality of the generated samples. Our approach is simple, general, and can be applied both in supervised and unsupervised settings.	7	135	4	1	20	5.792592592592592
01	We propose a black-box algorithm called {\it Adversarial Variational Inference and Learning} (AdVIL)  to perform inference and learning on a general Markov random field (MRF). AdVIL employs two variational distributions to approximately infer the latent variables and estimate the partition function of an MRF, respectively. The two variational distributions provide an estimate of the negative log-likelihood of the MRF as a minimax optimization problem, which is solved by stochastic gradient descent. AdVIL is proven convergent under certain conditions. On one hand, compared with contrastive divergence, AdVIL requires a minimal assumption about the model structure and can deal with a broader family of MRFs. On the other hand, compared with existing black-box methods, AdVIL provides a tighter estimate of the log partition function and achieves much better empirical results. 	10	128	4	1	18	5.890625
10	Supervised learning with irregularly sampled time series have been a challenge to Machine Learning methods due to the obstacle of dealing with irregular time intervals. Some papers introduced recently recurrent neural network models that deals with irregularity, but most of them rely on complex mechanisms to achieve a better performance. This work propose a novel method to represent timestamps (hours or dates) as dense vectors using sinusoidal functions, called Time Embeddings. As a data input method it and can be applied to most machine learning models. The method was evaluated with two predictive tasks from MIMIC III, a dataset of irregularly sampled time series of electronic health records. Our tests showed an improvement to LSTM-based and classical machine learning models, specially with very irregular data.	11	125	3	0	18	5.5920000000000005
01	"Expressive efficiency refers to the relation between two architectures A and B, whereby any function realized by B could be replicated by A, but there exists functions realized by A, which cannot be replicated by B unless its size grows significantly larger. For example, it is known that deep networks are exponentially efficient with respect to shallow networks, in the sense that a shallow network must grow exponentially large in order to approximate the functions represented by a deep network of polynomial size. In this work, we extend the study of expressive efficiency to the attribute of network connectivity and in particular to the effect of ""overlaps"" in the convolutional process, i.e., when the stride of the convolution is smaller than its filter size (receptive field).To theoretically analyze this aspect of network's design, we focus on a well-established surrogate for ConvNets called Convolutional Arithmetic Circuits (ConvACs), and then demonstrate empirically that our results hold for standard ConvNets as well. Specifically, our analysis shows that having overlapping local receptive fields, and more broadly denser connectivity, results in an exponential increase in the expressive capacity of neural networks. Moreover, while denser connectivity can increase the expressive capacity, we show that the most common types of modern architectures already exhibit exponential increase in expressivity, without relying on fully-connected layers."	10	217	4	0	19	5.764976958525344
10	Neural networks could misclassify inputs that are slightly different from their training data, which indicates a small margin between their decision boundaries and the training dataset. In this work, we study the binary classification of linearly separable datasets and show that linear classifiers could also have decision boundaries that lie close to their training dataset if cross-entropy loss is used for training. In particular, we show that if the features of the training dataset lie in a low-dimensional affine subspace and the cross-entropy loss is minimized by using a gradient method, the margin between the training points and the decision boundary could be much smaller than the optimal value. This result is contrary to the conclusions of recent related works such as (Soudry et al., 2018), and we identify the reason for this contradiction. In order to improve the margin, we introduce differential training, which is a training paradigm that uses a loss function defined on pairs of points from each class. We show that the decision boundary of a linear classifier trained with differential training indeed achieves the maximum margin. The results reveal the use of cross-entropy loss as one of the hidden culprits of adversarial examples and introduces a new direction to make neural networks robust against them.	6	210	5	0	30	5.342857142857143
01	We investigate the properties of multidimensional probability distributions in the context of latent space prior distributions of implicit generative models. Our work revolves around the phenomena arising while decoding linear interpolations between two random latent vectors -- regions of latent space in close proximity to the origin of the space are oversampled, which restricts the usability of linear interpolations as a tool to analyse the latent space. We show that the distribution mismatch can be eliminated completely by a proper choice of the latent probability distribution or using non-linear interpolations. We prove that there is a trade off between the interpolation being linear, and the latent distribution having even the most basic properties required for stable training, such as finite mean. We use the multidimensional Cauchy distribution as an example of the prior distribution, and also provide a general method of creating non-linear interpolations, that is easily applicable to a large family of commonly used latent distributions.	6	157	4	0	15	5.745222929936308
10	"We propose a method which can visually explain the classification decision of deep neural networks (DNNs). There are many proposed methods in machine learning and computer vision seeking to clarify the decision of machine learning black boxes, specifically DNNs.  All of these methods try to gain insight into why the network ""chose class A"" as an answer. Humans, when searching for explanations, ask two types of questions. The first question is, ""Why did you choose this answer?"" The second question asks, ""Why did you not choose answer B over A?"" The previously proposed methods are either not able to provide the latter directly or efficiently.We introduce a method capable of answering the second question both directly and efficiently. In this work, we limit the inputs to be images. In general, the proposed method generates explanations in the input space of any model capable of efficient evaluation and gradient evaluation. We provide results, showing the superiority of this approach for gaining insight into the inner representation of machine learning models."	4	170	4	0	12	5.311764705882354
10	Most of recent work in cross-lingual word embeddings is severely Anglocentric. The vast majority of lexicon induction evaluation dictionaries are between English and another language, and the English embedding space is selected by default as the hub when learning in a multilingual setting. With this work, however, we challenge these practices. First, we show that the choice of hub language can significantly impact downstream lexicon induction performance. Second, we both expand the current evaluation dictionary collection to include all language pairs using triangulation, and also create new dictionaries for under-represented languages. Evaluating established methods over all these language pairs sheds light into their suitability and presents new challenges for the field. Finally, in our analysis we identify general guidelines for strong cross-lingual embeddings baselines, based on more than just Anglocentric experiments. 	6	131	3	0	21	6.152671755725192
10	We show that by comparing the individual complexities of univariante cause and effect in the Structural Causal Model, one can identify the cause and the effect, without considering their interaction at all. The entropy of each variable is ineffective in measuring the complexity, and we propose to capture it by an autoencoder that operates on the list of sorted samples. Comparing the reconstruction errors of the two autoencoders, one for each variable, is shown to perform well on the accepted benchmarks of the field.In the multivariate case, where one can ensure that the complexities of the cause and effect are balanced, we propose a new method that mimics the disentangled structure of the causal model. We extend the results of~\cite{Zhang:2009:IPC:1795114.1795190} to the multidimensional case, showing that such modeling is only likely in the direction of causality. Furthermore, the learned model is shown theoretically to perform the separation to the causal component and to the residual  (noise) component. Our multidimensional method obtains a significantly higher accuracy than the literature methods.	10	170	0	0	0	5.582352941176469
01	We address the problem of learning structured policies for continuous control. In traditional reinforcement learning, policies of agents are learned by MLPs which take the concatenation of all observations from the environment as input for predicting actions. In this work, we propose NerveNet to explicitly model the structure of an agent, which naturally takes the form of a graph. Specifically, serving as the agent's policy network, NerveNet first propagates information over the structure of the agent and then predict actions for different parts of the agent. In the experiments, we first show that our NerveNet is comparable to state-of-the-art methods on standard MuJoCo environments. We further propose our customized reinforcement learning environments for benchmarking two types of structure transfer learning tasks, i.e., size and disability transfer. We demonstrate that policies learned by NerveNet are significantly better than policies learned by other models and are able to transfer even in a zero-shot setting.	8	152	3	0	16	5.776315789473684
01	Reinforcement learning agents that operate in diverse and complex environments can benefit from the structured decomposition of their behavior. Often, this is addressed in the context of hierarchical reinforcement learning, where the aim is to decompose a policy into lower-level primitives or options, and a higher-level meta-policy that triggers the appropriate behaviors for a given situation. However, the meta-policy must still produce appropriate decisions in all states.In this work, we propose a policy design that decomposes into primitives, similarly to hierarchical reinforcement learning, but without a high-level meta-policy. Instead, each primitive can decide for themselves whether they wish to act in the current state.We use an information-theoretic mechanism for enabling this decentralized decision: each primitive chooses how much information it needs about the current state to make a decision and the primitive that requests the most information about the current state acts in the world. The primitives are regularized to use as little information as possible, which leads to natural competition and specialization. We experimentally demonstrate that this policy architecture improves over both flat and hierarchical policies in terms of generalization. 	8	183	3	0	15	5.9890710382513666
01	We introduce a deep recurrent neural network architecture that approximates visual cortical circuits (Mély et al., 2018). We show that this architecture, which we refer to as the 𝜸-net, learns to solve contour detection tasks with better sample efficiency than state-of-the-art feedforward networks, while also exhibiting a classic perceptual illusion, known as the orientation-tilt illusion. Correcting this illusion significantly reduces \gnetw contour detection accuracy by driving it to prefer low-level edges over high-level object boundary contours. Overall, our study suggests that the orientation-tilt illusion is a byproduct of neural circuits that help biological visual systems achieve robust and efficient contour detection, and that incorporating these circuits in artificial neural networks can improve computer vision.	6	114	4	1	15	6.315789473684211
01	Deep neural networks are known to be annotation-hungry. Numerous efforts have been devoted to reducing the annotation cost when learning with deep networks. Two prominent directions include learning with noisy labels and semi-supervised learning by exploiting unlabeled data. In this work, we propose DivideMix, a novel framework for learning with noisy labels by leveraging semi-supervised learning techniques. In particular, DivideMix models the per-sample loss distribution with a mixture model to dynamically divide the training data into a labeled set with clean samples and an unlabeled set with noisy samples, and trains the model on both the labeled and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner. To avoid confirmation bias, we simultaneously train two diverged networks where each network uses the dataset division from the other network. During the semi-supervised training phase, we improve the MixMatch strategy by performing label co-refinement and label co-guessing on labeled and unlabeled samples, respectively. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

01	Within many machine learning algorithms, a fundamental problem concerns efficient calculation of an unbiased gradient wrt parameters $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ for expectation-based objectives $\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} (\boldsymbol{y})} [f (\boldsymbol{y}) ]$. Most existing methods either ($i$) suffer from high variance, seeking help from (often) complicated variance-reduction techniques; or ($ii$) they only apply to reparameterizable continuous random variables and employ a reparameterization trick. To address these limitations, we propose a General and One-sample (GO) gradient that ($i$) applies to many distributions associated with non-reparameterizable continuous {\em or} discrete random variables, and ($ii$) has the same low-variance as the reparameterization trick. We find that the GO gradient often works well in practice based on only one Monte Carlo sample (although one can of course use more samples if desired). Alongside the GO gradient, we develop a means of propagating the chain rule through distributions, yielding statistical back-propagation, coupling neural networks to common random variables.	5	147	11	0	16	6.700680272108843
10	The nonlocal network is designed for capturing long-range spatial-temporal dependencies in several computer vision tasks. Although having shown excellent performances, it needs an elaborate preparation for both the number and position of the building blocks. In this paper, we propose a new formulation of the nonlocal block and interpret it from the general graph signal processing perspective, where we view it as a fully-connected graph filter approximated by Chebyshev polynomials. The proposed nonlocal block is more efficient and robust, which is a generalized form of existing nonlocal blocks (e.g. nonlocal block, nonlocal stage). Moreover, we give the stable hypothesis and show that the steady-state of the deeper nonlocal structure should meet with it. Based on the stable hypothesis,  a full-order approximation of the nonlocal block is derived for consecutive connections. Experimental results illustrate the clear-cut improvement and practical applicability of the generalized nonlocal block on both image and video classification tasks.	6	151	3	1	0	5.960264900662253
10	Does attention matter and, if so, when and how? Our study on both inductive and transductive learning suggests that datasets have a strong influence on the effects of attention in graph neural networks. Independent of learning setting, task and attention variant, attention mostly degenerate to simple averaging for all three citation networks, whereas they behave strikingly different in the protein-protein interaction networks and molecular graphs: nodes attend to different neighbors per head and get more focused in deeper layers. Consequently, attention distributions become telltale features of the datasets themselves. We further explore the possibility of transferring attention for graph sparsification and show that, when applicable, attention-based sparsification retains enough information to obtain good performance while reducing computational and storage costs. Finally, we point out several possible directions for further study and transfer of attention.	8	134	5	0	20	6.2611940298507465
10	Image-to-image (I2I) translation aims to translate images from one domain to another. To tackle the multi-modal version of I2I translation, where input and output domains have a one-to-many relation, an extra latent input is provided to the generator to specify a particular output. Recent works propose involved training objectives to learn a latent embedding, jointly with the generator, that models the distribution of possible outputs. Alternatively, we study a simple, yet powerful pre-training strategy for multi-modal I2I translation. We first pre-train an encoder, using a proxy task, to encode the style of an image, such as color and texture, into a low-dimensional latent style vector. Then we train a generator to transform an input image along with a style-code to the output domain. Our generator achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks with a training objective that includes just a GAN loss and a reconstruction loss, which simplifies and speeds up the training significantly compared to competing approaches. We further study the contribution of different loss terms to learning the task of multi-modal I2I translation, and finally we show that the learned style embedding is not dependent on the target domain and generalizes well to other domains.	7	196	4	0	13	5.545918367346939
01	Developing agents that can learn to follow natural language instructions has been an emerging research direction. While being accessible and flexible, natural language instructions can sometimes be ambiguous even to humans. To address this, we propose to utilize programs, structured in a formal language, as a precise and expressive way to specify tasks. We then devise a modular framework that learns to perform a task specified by a program – as different circumstances give rise to diverse ways to accomplish the task, our framework can perceive which circumstance it is currently under, and instruct a multitask policy accordingly to fulfill each subtask of the overall task. Experimental results on a 2D Minecraft environment not only demonstrate that the proposed framework learns to reliably accomplish program instructions and achieves zero-shot generalization to more complex instructions but also verify the efficiency of the proposed modulation mechanism for learning the multitask policy. We also conduct an analysis comparing various models which learn from programs and natural language instructions in an end-to-end fashion.	3	169	6	0	20	5.7514792899408285
10	We present an approach for anytime predictions in deep neural networks (DNNs). For each test sample, an anytime predictor produces a coarse result quickly, and then continues to refine it until the test-time computational budget is depleted. Such predictors can address the growing computational problem of DNNs by automatically adjusting to varying test-time budgets. In this work, we study a \emph{general} augmentation to feed-forward networks to form anytime neural networks (ANNs) via auxiliary predictions and losses. Specifically, we point out a blind-spot in recent studies in such ANNs: the importance of high final accuracy. In fact, we show on multiple recognition data-sets and architectures that by having near-optimal final predictions in small anytime models, we can effectively double the speed of large ones to reach corresponding accuracy level. We achieve such speed-up with simple weighting of anytime losses that oscillate during training. We also assemble a sequence of exponentially deepening ANNs, to achieve both theoretically and practically near-optimal anytime results at any budget, at the cost of a constant fraction of additional consumed budget.	10	174	4	0	30	5.770114942528736
01	Although deep convolutional networks have achieved improved performance in many natural language tasks, they have been treated as black boxes because they are difficult to interpret. Especially, little is known about how they represent language in their intermediate layers. In an attempt to understand the representations of deep convolutional networks trained on language tasks, we show that individual units are selectively responsive to specific morphemes, words, and phrases, rather than responding to arbitrary and uninterpretable patterns. In order to quantitatively analyze such intriguing phenomenon, we propose a concept alignment method based on how units respond to replicated text. We conduct analyses with different architectures on multiple datasets for classification and translation tasks and provide new insights into how deep models understand natural language.	10	123	2	0	19	6.1626016260162615
10	It has been noted in existing literature that over-parameterization in ReLU networks generally improves performance. While there could be several factors involved behind this, we prove some desirable theoretical properties at initialization which may be enjoyed by ReLU networks. Specifically, it is known that He initialization in deep ReLU networks asymptotically preserves variance of activations in the forward pass and variance of gradients in the backward pass for infinitely wide networks, thus preserving the flow of information in both directions. Our paper goes beyond these results and shows novel properties that hold under He initialization: i) the norm of hidden activation of each layer is equal to the norm of the input, and, ii) the norm of weight gradient of each layer is equal to the product of norm of the input vector and the error at output layer. These results are derived using the PAC analysis framework, and hold true for finitely sized datasets such that the width of the ReLU network only needs to be larger than a certain finite lower bound. As we show, this lower bound depends on the depth of the network and the number of samples, and by the virtue of being a lower bound, over-parameterized ReLU networks are endowed with these desirable properties. For the aforementioned hidden activation norm property under He initialization, we further extend our theory and show that this property holds for a finite width network even when the number of data samples is infinite. Thus we overcome several limitations of existing papers, and show new properties of deep ReLU networks at initialization.	10	263	4	0	43	5.182509505703422
10	RMSProp and ADAM continue to be extremely popular algorithms for training neural nets but their theoretical convergence properties have remained unclear. Further, recent work has seemed to suggest that these algorithms have worse generalization properties when compared to carefully tuned stochastic gradient descent or its momentum variants. In this work, we make progress towards a deeper understanding of ADAM and RMSProp in two ways. First, we provide proofs that these adaptive gradient algorithms are guaranteed to reach criticality for smooth non-convex objectives, and we give bounds on the running time.Next we design experiments to empirically study the convergence and generalization properties of RMSProp and ADAM against Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient method on a variety of common autoencoder setups and on VGG-9 with CIFAR-10. Through these experiments we demonstrate the interesting sensitivity that ADAM has to its momentum parameter \beta_1. We show that at very high values of the momentum parameter (\beta_1 = 0.99) ADAM outperforms a carefully tuned NAG on most of our experiments, in terms of getting lower training and test losses. On the other hand, NAG can sometimes do better when ADAM's \beta_1 is set to the most commonly used value: \beta_1 = 0.9, indicating the importance of tuning the hyperparameters of ADAM to get better generalization performance.We also report experiments on different autoencoders to demonstrate that NAG has better abilities in terms of reducing the gradient norms, and it also produces iterates which exhibit an increasing trend for the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss function at the iterates. 	16	255	5	0	31	5.541176470588236
10	Generative models are important tools to capture and investigate the properties of complex empirical data. Recent developments such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) use two very similar, but \textit{reverse}, deep convolutional architectures, one to generate and one to extract information from data. Does learning the parameters of both architectures obey the same rules? We exploit the causality principle of independence of mechanisms to quantify how the weights of successive layers adapt to each other. Using the recently introduced Spectral Independence Criterion, we quantify the dependencies between the kernels of successive convolutional layers and show that those are more independent for the generative process than for information extraction, in line with results from the field of causal inference. In addition, our experiments on generation of human faces suggest that more independence between successive layers of generators results in improved performance of these architectures.	15	146	3	0	11	6.1506849315068495
10	Self-supervision, in which a target task is improved without external supervision, has primarily been explored in settings that assume the availability of additional data. However, in many cases, particularly in healthcare, one may not have access to additional data (labeled or otherwise). In such settings, we hypothesize that self-supervision based solely on the structure of the data at-hand can help. We explore a novel self-supervision framework for time-series data, in which multiple auxiliary tasks (e.g., forecasting) are included to improve overall performance on a sequence-level target task without additional training data. We call this approach limited self-supervision, as we limit ourselves to only the data at-hand. We demonstrate the utility of limited self-supervision on three sequence-level classification tasks, two pertaining to real clinical data and one using synthetic data. Within this framework, we introduce novel forms of self-supervision and demonstrate their utility in improving performance on the target task. Our results indicate that limited self-supervision leads to a consistent improvement over a supervised baseline, across a range of domains. In particular, for the task of identifying atrial fibrillation from small amounts of electrocardiogram data, we observe a nearly 13% improvement in the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) relative to the baseline (AUC-ROC=0.55 vs. AUC-ROC=0.62). Limited self-supervision applied to sequential data can aid in learning intermediate representations, making it particularly applicable in settings where data collection is difficult.	13	230	3	1	27	6.1521739130434785
01	A critical component to enabling intelligent reasoning in partially observable environments is memory. Despite this importance, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents have so far used relatively simple memory architectures, with the main methods to overcome partial observability being either a temporal convolution over the past k frames or an LSTM layer. More recent work (Oh et al., 2016) has went beyond these architectures by using memory networks which can allow more sophisticated addressing schemes over the past k frames. But even these architectures are unsatisfactory due to the reason that they are limited to only remembering information from the last k frames. In this paper, we develop a memory system with an adaptable write operator that is customized to the sorts of 3D environments that DRL agents typically interact with. This architecture, called the Neural Map, uses a spatially structured 2D memory image to learn to store arbitrary information about the environment over long time lags. We demonstrate empirically that the Neural Map surpasses previous DRL memories on a set of challenging 2D and 3D maze environments and show that it is capable of generalizing to environments that were not seen during training. 	8	193	3	0	0	5.424870466321243
10	We propose a method for joint image and per-pixel annotation synthesis with GAN. We demonstrate that GAN has good high-level representation of target data that can be easily projected to semantic segmentation masks. This method can be used to create a training dataset for teaching separate semantic segmentation network. Our experiments show that such segmentation network successfully generalizes on real data. Additionally, the method outperforms supervised training when the number of training samples is small, and works on variety of different scenes and classes. The source code of the proposed method will be publicly available. 	6	95	2	0	9	5.705263157894738
10	High-risk domains require reliable confidence estimates from predictive models. Deep latent variable models provide these, but suffer from the rigid variational distributions used for tractable inference, which err on the side of overconfidence.We propose Stochastic Quantized Activation Distributions (SQUAD), which imposes a flexible yet tractable distribution over discretized latent variables.The proposed method is scalable, self-normalizing and sample efficient. We demonstrate that the model fully utilizes the flexible distribution, learns interesting non-linearities, and provides predictive uncertainty of competitive quality.	4	80	7	0	23	6.9875
10	We propose a general method for various image restoration problems, such as denoising, deblurring, super-resolution and inpainting. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Its objective is to maximize a posteriori probability of latent variables, and its constraint is that the image generated by these latent variables must be the same as the degraded image. We use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as our density estimation model. Convincing results are obtained on MNIST dataset.	13	76	0	0	0	5.7631578947368425
10	Deep neural networks can learn meaningful representations of data. However, these representations are hard to interpret. For example, visualizing a latent layer is generally only possible for at most three dimensions. Neural networks are able to learn and benefit from much higher dimensional representations but these are not visually interpretable because nodes have arbitrary ordering within a layer. Here, we utilize the ability of the human observer to identify patterns in structured representations to visualize higher dimensions. To do so, we propose a class of regularizations we call \textit{Graph Spectral Regularizations} that impose graph-structure on latent layers. This is achieved by treating activations as signals on a predefined graph and constraining those activations using graph filters, such as low pass and wavelet-like filters. This framework allows for any kind of graph as well as filter to achieve a wide range of structured regularizations depending on the inference needs of the data. First, we show a synthetic example that the graph-structured layer can reveal topological features of the data. Next, we show that a smoothing regularization can impose semantically consistent ordering of nodes when applied to capsule nets. Further, we show that the graph-structured layer, using wavelet-like spatially localized filters, can form localized receptive fields for improved image and biomedical data interpretation. In other words, the mapping between latent layer, neurons and the output space becomes clear due to the localization of the activations. Finally, we show that when structured as a grid, the representations create coherent images that allow for image-processing techniques such as convolutions.	7	255	6	0	11	5.819607843137255
10	In this work, we address the task of natural image generation guided by a conditioning input. We introduce a new architecture called conditional invertible neural network (cINN). It combines the purely generative INN model with an unconstrained feed-forward network, which efficiently pre-processes the conditioning input into useful features.  All parameters of a cINN are jointly optimized with a stable, maximum likelihood-based training procedure. Even though INNs and other normalizing flow models have received very little attention in the literature in contrast to GANs, we find that cINNs can achieve comparable quality, with some remarkable properties absent in cGANs, e.g.  apparent immunity to mode collapse. We demonstrate these properties for the tasks of MNIST digit generation and image colorization. Furthermore, we take advantage of our bidirectional cINN architecture to explore and manipulate emergent properties of the latent space, such as changing the image style in an intuitive way.	8	147	3	0	0	5.83673469387755
10	We present Tensor-Train RNN (TT-RNN), a novel family of neural sequence architectures for multivariate forecasting in environments with nonlinear dynamics. Long-term forecasting in such systems is highly challenging, since there exist long-term temporal dependencies, higher-order correlations and sensitivity to error propagation. Our proposed tensor recurrent architecture addresses these issues by learning the nonlinear dynamics directly using higher order moments and high-order state transition functions. Furthermore, we decompose the higher-order structure using the tensor-train (TT) decomposition to reduce the number of parameters while preserving the model performance. We theoretically establish the approximation properties of Tensor-Train RNNs for general sequence inputs, and such guarantees are not available for usual RNNs. We also demonstrate significant long-term prediction improvements over general RNN and LSTM architectures on a range of simulated environments with nonlinear dynamics, as well on real-world climate and traffic data.	5	138	4	0	10	6.666666666666668
10	Recent improvements in large-scale language models have driven progress on automatic generation of syntactically and semantically consistent text for many real-world applications. Many of these advances leverage the availability of large corpora. While training on such corpora encourages the model to understand long-range dependencies in text, it can also result in the models internalizing the social biases present in the corpora. This paper aims to quantify and reduce biases exhibited by language models. Given a conditioning context (e.g. a writing prompt) and a language model, we analyze if (and how) the sentiment of the generated text is affected by changes in values of sensitive attributes (e.g. country names, occupations, genders, etc.) in the conditioning context, a.k.a. counterfactual evaluation. We quantify these biases by adapting individual and group fairness metrics from the fair machine learning literature. Extensive evaluation on two different corpora (news articles and Wikipedia) shows that state-of-the-art Transformer-based language models exhibit biases learned from data. We propose embedding-similarity and sentiment-similarity regularization methods that improve both individual and group fairness metrics without sacrificing perplexity and semantic similarity---a positive step toward development and deployment of fairer language models for real-world applications.	9	190	4	0	14	6.3842105263157904
01	Learning policies for complex tasks that require multiple different skills is a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). It is also a requirement for its deployment in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel framework for efficient multi-task reinforcement learning. Our framework trains agents to employ hierarchical policies that decide when to use a previously learned policy and when to learn a new skill. This enables agents to continually acquire new skills during different stages of training. Each learned task corresponds to a human language description. Because agents can only access previously learned skills through these descriptions, the agent can always provide a human-interpretable description of its choices. In order to help the agent learn the complex temporal dependencies necessary for the hierarchical policy, we provide it with a stochastic temporal grammar that modulates when to rely on previously learned skills and when to execute new skills. We validate our approach on Minecraft games designed to explicitly test the ability to reuse previously learned skills while simultaneously learning new skills.	9	170	6	0	25	5.764705882352941
10	Neural network pruning techniques have demonstrated it is possible to remove the majority of weights in a network with surprisingly little degradation to top-1 test set accuracy. However, this measure of performance conceals significant differences in how different classes and images are impacted by pruning. We find that certain individual data points, which we term pruning identified exemplars (PIEs), and classes are systematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Removing PIE images from the test-set greatly improves top-1 accuracy for both sparse and non-sparse models. These hard-to-generalize-to images tend to be of lower image quality, mislabelled, entail abstract representations, require fine-grained classification or depict atypical class examples.	10	108	1	0	21	6.222222222222222
10	While natural language processing systems often focus on a single language, multilingual transfer learning has the potential to improve performance, especially for low-resource languages. We introduce XLDA, cross-lingual data augmentation, a method that replaces a segment of the input text with its translation in another language. XLDA enhances performance of all 14 tested languages of the cross-lingual natural language inference (XNLI) benchmark. With improvements of up to 4.8, training with XLDA achieves state-of-the-art performance for Greek, Turkish, and Urdu. XLDA is in contrast to, and performs markedly better than, a more naive approach that aggregates examples in various languages in a way that each example is solely in one language. On the SQuAD question answering task, we see that XLDA provides a 1.0 performance increase on the English evaluation set. Comprehensive experiments suggest that most languages are effective as cross-lingual augmentors, that XLDA is robust to a wide range of translation quality, and that XLDA is even more effective for randomly initialized models than for pretrained models.	11	167	3	0	11	5.754491017964072
10	Adam-typed optimizers, as a class of adaptive moment estimation methods with the exponential moving average scheme, have been successfully used in many applications of deep learning. Such methods are appealing for capability on large-scale sparse datasets. On top of that, they are computationally efficient and insensitive to the hyper-parameter settings. In this paper, we present a new framework for adapting Adam-typed methods, namely AdamT. Instead of applying a simple exponential weighted average, AdamT also includes the trend information when updating the parameters with the adaptive step size and gradients. The newly added term is expected to efficiently capture the non-horizontal moving patterns on the cost surface, and thus converge more rapidly. We show empirically the importance of the trend component, where AdamT outperforms the conventional Adam method constantly in both convex and non-convex settings.	8	134	4	1	27	5.91044776119403
01	In many machine learning problems, loss functions are weighted sums of several terms. A typical approach to dealing with these is to train multiple separate models with different selections of weights and then either choose the best one according to some criterion or keep multiple models if it is desirable to maintain a diverse set of solutions. This is inefficient both at training and at inference time. We propose a method that allows replacing multiple models trained on one loss function each by a single model trained on a distribution of losses. At test time a model trained this way can be conditioned to generate outputs corresponding to any loss from the training distribution of losses. We demonstrate this approach on three tasks with parametrized losses: beta-VAE, learned image compression, and fast style transfer.	9	134	2	0	22	5.208955223880597

Todetect them, significant research has been done using handwritten signatures ormachine learning based on manual feature extraction. Those approaches are bothtime-consuming, requires significant prior knowledge and the list of features hasto be updated with each newly discovered vulnerability. In this work, we proposea novel algorithm that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the bytelevel of the file, without any handcrafted features. We show, using a data setof 130000 files, that our approach maintains a high detection rate (96%) of PDFmalware and even detects new malicious files, still undetected by most antiviruses.Using automatically generated features from our CNN network, and applying aclustering algorithm, we also obtain high similarity between the antiviruses’ labelsand the resulting clusters.	5	138	3	1	0	5.615942028985506
01	Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a simple and effective deep generative model, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many advanced variants and theoretical investigations. However, recent studies demonstrate that, when equipped with expressive generative distributions (aka. decoders), VAE suffers from learning uninformative latent representations with the observation called KL Varnishing, in which case VAE collapses into an unconditional generative model. In this work, we introduce mutual posterior-divergence regularization, a novel regularization that is able to control the geometry of the latent space to accomplish meaningful representation learning, while achieving comparable or superior capability of density estimation.Experiments on three image benchmark datasets demonstrate that, when equipped with powerful decoders, our model performs well both on density estimation and representation learning.	7	122	3	0	0	6.713114754098362
10	Generative modelling is often cast as minimizing a similarity measure between a data distribution and a model distribution. Recently, a popular choice for the similarity measure has been the Wasserstein metric, which can be expressed in the Kantorovich duality formulation as the optimum difference of the expected values of a potential function under the real data distribution and the model hypothesis. In practice, the potential is approximated with a neural network and is called the discriminator. Duality constraints on the function class of the discriminator are enforced approximately, and the expectations are estimated from samples. This gives at least three sources of errors: the approximated discriminator and constraints, the estimation of the expectation value, and the optimization required to find the optimal potential. In this work, we study how well the methods, that are used in generative adversarial networks to approximate the Wasserstein metric, perform. We consider, in particular, the $c$-transform formulation, which eliminates the need to enforce the constraints explicitly. We demonstrate that the $c$-transform allows for a more accurate estimation of the true Wasserstein metric from samples, but surprisingly, does not	8	183	3	0	19	5.841530054644808
10	This paper considers probability distributions of penultimate activations in deep classiﬁcation networks. We ﬁrst identify a dual relation between the activations and the weights of the ﬁnal fully connected layer: learning the networks with the cross-entropy loss makes their (normalized) penultimate activations follow a von Mises-Fisher distribution for each class, which is parameterized by the weights of the ﬁnal fully-connected layer. Through this analysis, we derive a probability density function of penultimate activations per class. This generative model allows us to synthesize activations of classiﬁcation networks without feeding images forward through them. We also demonstrate through experiments that our generative model of penultimate activations can be applied to real-world applications such as knowledge distillation and class-conditional image generation.	9	118	0	0	0	6.440677966101696
10	As for knowledge-based question answering, a fundamental problem is to relax the assumption of answerable questions from simple questions to compound questions. Traditional approaches firstly detect topic entity mentioned in questions, then traverse the knowledge graph to find relations as a multi-hop path to answers, while we propose a novel approach to leverage simple-question answerers to answer compound questions. Our model consists of two parts: (i) a novel learning-to-decompose agent that learns a policy to decompose a compound question into simple questions and (ii) three independent simple-question answerers that classify the corresponding relations for each simple question. Experiments demonstrate that our model learns complex rules of compositionality as stochastic policy, which benefits simple neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art results on WebQuestions and MetaQA. We analyze the interpretable decomposition process as well as generated partitions.	8	134	4	0	16	6.3134328358208975
01	We leverage recent insights from second-order optimisation for neural networks to construct a Kronecker factored Laplace approximation to the posterior over the weights of a trained network. Our approximation requires no modification of the training procedure, enabling practitioners to estimate the uncertainty of their models currently used in production without having to retrain them. We extensively compare our method to using Dropout and a diagonal Laplace approximation for estimating the uncertainty of a network. We demonstrate that our Kronecker factored method leads to better uncertainty estimates on out-of-distribution data and is more robust to simple adversarial attacks. Our approach only requires calculating two square curvature factor matrices for each layer. Their size is equal to the respective square of the input and output size of the layer, making the method efficient both computationally and in terms of memory usage. We illustrate its scalability by applying it to a state-of-the-art convolutional network architecture.	7	152	4	0	21	5.907894736842105
01	The ability to synthesize realistic patterns of neural activity is crucial for studying neural information processing. Here we used the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to simulate the concerted activity of a population of neurons.We adapted the Wasserstein-GAN variant to facilitate the generation of unconstrained neural population activity patterns while still benefiting from parameter sharing in the temporal domain.We demonstrate that our proposed GAN, which we termed Spike-GAN, generates spike trains that match accurately the first- and second-order statistics of datasets of tens of neurons and also approximates well their higher-order statistics. We applied Spike-GAN to a real dataset recorded from salamander retina and showed that it performs as well as state-of-the-art approaches based on the maximum entropy and the dichotomized Gaussian frameworks. Importantly, Spike-GAN does not require to specify a priori the statistics to be matched by the model, and so constitutes a more flexible method than these alternative approaches.Finally, we show how to exploit a trained Spike-GAN  to construct 'importance maps' to detect the most relevant statistical structures present in a spike train. Spike-GAN provides a powerful, easy-to-use technique for generating realistic spiking neural activity and for describing the most relevant features of the large-scale neural population recordings studied in modern systems neuroscience.	10	208	6	0	19	6.0288461538461515
10	Recently, deep learning has made extraordinary achievements in text classification. However, most of present models, especially convolutional neural network (CNN), do not extract long-range associations, global representations, and hierarchical features well due to their relatively shallow and simple structures. This causes a negative effect on text classification. Moreover, we find that there are many express methods of texts. It is appropriate to design the multi-input model to improve the classification effect. But most of models of text classification only use words or characters and do not use the multi-input model. Inspired by the above points and Densenet (Gao Huang, Zhuang Liu, Laurens Van Der Maaten, and Kilian Q Weinberger. Densely connected convolutional networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 4700–4708, 2017.), we propose a new text classification model, which uses words, characters, and labels as input. The model, which is a deep CNN with a novel attention mechanism, can effectively leverage the input information and solve the above issues of the shallow model. We conduct experiments on six large text classification datasets. Our model achieves the state of the art results on all datasets compared to multiple baseline models.	11	196	5	0	34	5.709183673469387
10	 Interest has been rising lately towards methods representing data in non-Euclidean spaces, e.g. hyperbolic or spherical. These geometries provide specific inductive biases useful for certain real-world data properties, e.g. scale-free or hierarchical graphs are best embedded in a hyperbolic space. However, the very popular class of  graph neural networks is currently limited to model data only via Euclidean node embeddings and associated vector space operations. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing mathematically grounded generalizations of graph convolutional networks (GCN) to (products of) constant curvature spaces. We do this by i) extending the gyro-vector space theory from hyperbolic to spherical spaces, providing a unified and smooth view of the two geometries, ii) leveraging gyro-barycentric coordinates that generalize the classic Euclidean concept of the center of mass. Our class of models gives strict generalizations in the sense that they recover their Euclidean counterparts when the curvature goes to zero from either side. Empirically, our methods outperform different types of classic Euclidean GCNs in the tasks of node classification and minimizing distortion for symbolic data exhibiting non-Euclidean behavior, according to their discrete curvature. 	5	183	5	0	16	6.049180327868853
10	We propose a new type of adversarial attack to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for image classification. Different from most existing attacks that directly perturb input pixels. Our attack focuses on perturbing abstract features, more specifically, features that denote styles, including interpretable styles such as vivid colors and sharp outlines, and uninterpretable ones. It induces model misclassfication by injecting style changes insensitive for humans, through an optimization procedure. We show that state-of-the-art pixel space adversarial attack detection and defense techniques are ineffective in guarding against feature space attacks. 	5	87	0	0	0	6.413793103448278
10	Autonomous agents that must exhibit flexible and broad capabilities will need to be equipped with large repertoires of skills. Defining each skill with a manually-designed reward function limits this repertoire and imposes a manual engineering burden. Self-supervised agents that set their own goals can automate this process, but designing appropriate goal setting objectives can be difficult, and often involves heuristic design decisions. In this paper, we propose a formal exploration objective for goal-reaching policies that maximizes state coverage. We show that this objective is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the goal distribution together with goal reaching performance, where goals correspond to full state observations. To instantiate this principle, we present an algorithm called Skew-Fit for learning a maximum-entropy goal distributions. Skew-Fit enables self-supervised agents to autonomously choose and practice reaching diverse goals. We show that, under certain regularity conditions, our method converges to a uniform distribution over the set of valid states, even when we do not know this set beforehand. Our experiments show that it can learn a variety of manipulation tasks from images, including opening a door with a real robot, entirely from scratch and without any manually-designed reward function.	5	193	6	0	26	5.937823834196893
01	Training deep neural networks requires many training samples, but in practice training labels are expensive to obtain and may be of varying quality, as some may be from trusted expert labelers while others might be from heuristics or other sources of weak supervision such as crowd-sourcing. This creates a fundamental quality- versus-quantity trade-off in the learning process. Do we learn from the small amount of high-quality data or the potentially large amount of weakly-labeled data? We argue that if the learner could somehow know and take the label-quality into account when learning the data representation, we could get the best of both worlds. To this end, we propose “fidelity-weighted learning” (FWL), a semi-supervised student- teacher approach for training deep neural networks using weakly-labeled data. FWL modulates the parameter updates to a student network (trained on the task we care about) on a per-sample basis according to the posterior confidence of its label-quality estimated by a teacher (who has access to the high-quality labels). Both student and teacher are learned from the data. We evaluate FWL on two tasks in information retrieval and natural language processing where we outperform state-of-the-art alternative semi-supervised methods, indicating that our approach makes better use of strong and weak labels, and leads to better task-dependent data representations.	2	211	4	0	15	5.654028436018957
01	Model compression is significant for the wide adoption of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in both user devices possessing limited resources and business clusters requiring quick responses to large-scale service requests. This work aims to learn structurally-sparse Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) by reducing the sizes of basic structures within LSTM units, including input updates, gates, hidden states, cell states and outputs. Independently reducing the sizes of basic structures can result in inconsistent dimensions among them, and consequently, end up with invalid LSTM units. To overcome the problem, we propose Intrinsic Sparse Structures (ISS) in LSTMs. Removing a component of ISS will simultaneously decrease the sizes of all basic structures by one and thereby always maintain the dimension consistency. By learning ISS within LSTM units, the obtained LSTMs remain regular while having much smaller basic structures. Based on group Lasso regularization, our method achieves 10.59x speedup without losing any perplexity of a language modeling of Penn TreeBank dataset. It is also successfully evaluated through a compact model with only 2.69M weights for machine Question Answering of SQuAD dataset. Our approach is successfully extended to non- LSTM RNNs, like Recurrent Highway Networks (RHNs). Our source code is available.	8	195	6	0	0	5.856410256410255
10	Robustness of neural networks has recently been highlighted by the adversarial examples, i.e., inputs added with well-designed  perturbations which are imperceptible to humans but can cause the network to give incorrect outputs. In this paper, we design a new CNN architecture that by itself has good robustness. We introduce a simple but powerful technique, Random Mask, to modify existing CNN structures. We show that CNN with Random Mask achieves state-of-the-art performance against black-box adversarial attacks without applying any adversarial training. We next investigate the adversarial examples which “fool” a CNN with Random Mask. Surprisingly, we find that these adversarial examples often “fool” humans as well. This raises fundamental questions on how to define adversarial examples and robustness properly.	7	118	5	0	36	5.9576271186440675
10	As the complexity of neural network models has grown, it has become increasingly important to optimize their design automatically through metalearning. Methods for discovering hyperparameters, topologies, and learning rate schedules have lead to significant increases in performance. This paper shows that loss functions can be optimized with metalearning as well, and result in similar improvements. The method, Genetic Loss-function Optimization (GLO), discovers loss functions de novo, and optimizes them for a target task. Leveraging techniques from genetic programming, GLO builds loss functions hierarchically from a set of operators and leaf nodes. These functions are repeatedly recombined and mutated to find an optimal structure, and then a covariance-matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) is used to find optimal coefficients. Networks trained with GLO loss functions are found to outperform the standard cross-entropy loss on standard image classification tasks. Training with these new loss functions requires fewer steps, results in lower test error, and allows for smaller datasets to be used. Loss function optimization thus provides a new dimension of metalearning, and constitutes an important step towards AutoML.	11	175	5	0	29	6.1085714285714285
10	Decision forests (DF), in particular random forests and gradient boosting trees, have  demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other methods in many supervised learning scenarios. In particular, DFs dominate other methods in tabular data, that is, when the feature space is unstructured, so that the signal is invariant to permuting feature indices.  However, in structured data lying on a manifold---such as images, text, and speech---neural nets (NN) tend to outperform DFs. We conjecture that at least part of the reason for this is that the input to NN is not simply the feature magnitudes, but also their indices (for example, the convolution operation uses ``feature locality). In contrast, naive DF implementations fail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed DF approach demonstrates that DFs, for each node, implicitly sample a random matrix from some specific distribution.  Here, we build on that to show that one can choose distributions in a manifold aware fashion. For example, for image classification, rather than randomly selecting pixels, one can randomly select contiguous patches. We demonstrate the empirical performance of  data living on three different manifolds: images, time-series, and a torus. In all three cases, our Manifold Forest (Mf) algorithm empirically dominates other state-of-the-art approaches that ignore feature space structure, achieving a lower classification error on all sample sizes. This dominance extends to the MNIST data set as well. Moreover, both training and test time is significantly faster for manifold forests as compared to deep nets. This approach, therefore, has promise to enable DFs and other machine learning methods to close the gap with deep nets on manifold-valued data. 	8	264	6	0	23	5.681818181818183
10	Modern deep neural networks have a large amount of weights, which make them difficult to deploy on computation constrained devices such as mobile phones. One common approach to reduce the model size and computational cost is to use low-rank factorization to approximate a weight matrix. However, performing standard low-rank factorization with a small rank can hurt the model expressiveness and significantly decrease the performance. In this work, we propose to use a mixture of multiple low-rank factorizations to model a large weight matrix, and the mixture coefficients are computed dynamically depending on its input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both language modeling and image classification tasks. Experiments show that our method not only improves the computation efficiency but also maintains (sometimes outperforms) its accuracy compared with the full-rank counterparts.	9	133	4	0	21	5.879699248120301
01	Variational Bayesian neural networks (BNN) perform variational inference over weights, but it is difficult to specify meaningful priors and approximating posteriors in a high-dimensional weight space. We introduce functional variational Bayesian neural networks (fBNNs), which maximize an Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) defined directly on stochastic processes, i.e. distributions over functions. We prove that the KL divergence between stochastic processes is equal to the supremum of marginal KL divergences over all finite sets of inputs. Based on this, we introduce a practical training objective which approximates the functional ELBO using finite measurement sets and the spectral Stein gradient estimator. With fBNNs, we can specify priors which entail rich structure, including Gaussian processes and implicit stochastic processes. Empirically, we find that fBNNs extrapolate well using various structured priors, provide reliable uncertainty estimates, and can scale to large datasets.	5	136	3	0	14	6.294117647058822
10	We introduce a new approach to estimate continuous actions using actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning problems. Policy gradient methods usually predict one continuous action estimate or parameters of a presumed distribution (most commonly Gaussian) for any given state which might not be optimal as it may not capture the complete description of the target distribution. Our approach instead predicts M actions with the policy network (actor) and then uniformly sample one action during training as well as testing at each state. This allows the agent to learn a simple stochastic policy that has an easy to compute expected return. In all experiments, this facilitates better exploration of the state space during training and converges to a better policy. 	7	118	3	0	15	5.5423728813559325
10	Generative adversarial nets (GANs) have been successfully applied to the artificial generation of image data. In terms of text data, much has been done on the artificial generation of natural language from a single corpus. We consider multiple text corpora as the input data, for which there can be two applications of GANs: (1) the creation of consistent cross-corpus word embeddings given different word embeddings per corpus; (2) the generation of robust bag-of-words document embeddings for each corpora. We demonstrate our GAN models on real-world text data sets from different corpora, and show that embeddings from both models lead to improvements in supervised learning problems.	7	105	3	0	10	5.552380952380951
10	"It has widely shown that adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018) is effective in defending adversarial attack empirically. However, the theoretical understanding of the difference between the solution of adversarial training and that of standard training is limited.

Specifically, we show that if the data themselves are ”-strongly linearly-separable”, adversarialtraining with radius smaller than "" converges to the hard margin solution of SVM with a faster rate than standard training. If the data themselves are not ”-strongly linearly-separable”, we show that adversarial training with radius "" is stable to outliers while standard training is not. Moreover, we prove that the classifier returned by adversarial training with a large radius "" has low confidence in each data point. Experiments corroborate our theoretical finding well."	8	146	3	0	24	5.7602739726027385
10	Existing public face image datasets are strongly biased toward Caucasian faces, and other races (e.g., Latino) are significantly underrepresented. The models trained from such datasets suffer from inconsistent classification accuracy, which limits the applicability of face analytic systems to non-White race groups. To mitigate the race bias problem in these datasets, we constructed a novel face image dataset containing 108,501 images which is balanced on race. We define 7 race groups: White, Black, Indian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latino. Images were collected from the YFCC-100M Flickr dataset and labeled with race, gender, and age groups. Evaluations were performed on existing face attribute datasets as well as novel image datasets to measure the generalization performance. We find that the model trained from our dataset is substantially more accurate on novel datasets and the accuracy is consistent across race and gender groups. We also compare several commercial computer vision APIs and report their balanced accuracy across gender, race, and age groups. 	11	162	3	0	20	5.771604938271606
10	Robustness of convolutional neural networks has recently been highlighted by the adversarial examples, i.e., inputs added with well-designed perturbations which are imperceptible to humans but can cause the network to give incorrect outputs. Recent research suggests that the noises in adversarial examples break the textural structure, which eventually leads to wrong predictions by convolutional neural networks. To help a convolutional neural network make predictions relying less on textural information, we propose defective convolutional layers which contain defective neurons whose activations are set to be a constant function. As the defective neurons contain no information and are far different from the standard neurons in its spatial neighborhood, the textural features cannot be accurately extracted and the model has to seek for other features for classification, such as the shape. We first show that predictions made by the defective CNN are less dependent on textural information, but more on shape information, and further find that adversarial examples generated by the defective CNN appear to have semantic shapes. Experimental results demonstrate the defective CNN has higher defense ability than the standard CNN against various types of attack. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art performance against transfer-based attacks without applying any adversarial training.	6	198	4	1	26	6.0656565656565675
10	The understanding of sensor data has been greatly improved by advanced deep learning methods with big data. However, available sensor data in the real world are still limited, which is called the opportunistic sensor problem.  This paper proposes a new variant of neural machine translation seq2seq to deal with continuous signal waves by introducing the window-based (inverse-) representation to adaptively represent partial shapes of waves and the iterative back-translation model for high-dimensional data.  Experimental results are shown for two real-life data: earthquake and activity translation.  The performance improvements of one-dimensional data was about 46 % in test loss and that of high-dimensional data was about 1625 % in perplexity with regard to the original seq2seq.	4	115	5	0	0	5.817391304347826
10	Deep learning's success has led to larger and larger models to handle more and more complex tasks; trained models can contain millions of parameters. These large models are compute- and memory-intensive, which makes it a challenge to deploy them with minimized latency, throughput, and storage requirements. Some model compression methods have been successfully applied on image classification and detection or language models, but there has been very little work compressing generative adversarial networks (GANs) performing complex tasks. In this paper, we show that a standard model compression technique, weight pruning, cannot be applied to GANs using existing methods. We then develop a self-supervised compression technique which uses the trained discriminator to supervise the training of a compressed generator. We show that this framework has a compelling performance to high degrees of sparsity, generalizes well to new tasks and models, and enables meaningful comparisons between different pruning granularities.	3	147	4	0	33	5.9727891156462585
01	Reinforcement learning algorithms can train agents that solve problems in complex, interesting environments. Normally, the complexity of the trained agent is closely related to the complexity of the environment.  This suggests that a highly capable agent requires a complex environment for training.  In this paper, we point out that a competitive multi-agent environment trained with self-play can produce behaviors that are far more complex than the environment itself.  We also point out that such environments come with a natural curriculum, because for any skill level, an environment full of agents of this level will have the right level of difficulty.This work introduces several competitive multi-agent environments where agents compete in a 3D world with simulated physics. The trained agents learn a wide variety of complex and interesting skills, even though the environment themselves are relatively simple. The skills include behaviors such as running, blocking, ducking, tackling, fooling opponents, kicking, and defending using both arms and legs. A highlight of the learned behaviors can be found here: https://goo.gl/eR7fbX	5	168	4	0	0	5.785714285714287
01	  Learning a policy using only observational data is challenging because the distribution of states it induces at execution time may differ from the distribution observed during training. In this work, we propose to train a policy while explicitly penalizing the mismatch between these two distributions over a fixed time horizon. We do this by using a learned model of the environment dynamics which is unrolled for multiple time steps, and training a policy network to minimize a differentiable cost over this rolled-out trajectory. This cost contains two terms: a policy cost which represents the objective the policy seeks to optimize, and an uncertainty cost which represents its divergence from the states it is trained on. We propose to measure this second cost by using the uncertainty of the dynamics model about its own predictions, using recent ideas from uncertainty estimation for deep networks. We evaluate our approach using a large-scale observational dataset of driving behavior recorded from traffic cameras, and show that we are able to learn effective driving policies from purely observational data, with no environment interaction. 	11	178	3	0	18	5.47191011235955
10	Anomaly detection in time series data is an important topic in many domains. However, time series are known to be particular hard to analyze. Based on the recent developments in adversarially learned models, we propose a new approach for anomaly detection in time series data. We build upon the idea to use a combination of a reconstruction error and the output of a Critic network. To this end we propose a cycle-consistent GAN architecture for sequential data and a new way of measuring the reconstruction error. We then show in a detailed evaluation how the different parts of our model contribute to the final anomaly score and demonstrate how the method improves the results on several data sets. We also compare our model to other baseline anomaly detection methods to verify its performance.	8	133	2	0	14	5.007518796992481
10	Biological and artificial agents must learn to act optimally in spite of a limited capacity for processing, storing, and attending to information. We formalize this type of bounded rationality in terms of an information-theoretic constraint on the complexity of policies that agents seek to learn. We present the Capacity-Limited Reinforcement Learning (CLRL) objective which defines an optimal policy subject to an information capacity constraint. This objective is optimized by drawing from methods used in rate distortion theory and information theory, and applied to the reinforcement learning setting. Using this objective we implement a novel Capacity-Limited Actor-Critic (CLAC) algorithm and situate it within a broader family of RL algorithms such as the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) and discuss their similarities and differences. Our experiments show that compared to alternative approaches, CLAC offers improvements in generalization between training and modified test environments. This is achieved in the CLAC model while displaying high sample efficiency and minimal requirements for hyper-parameter tuning.	11	158	4	0	20	6.075949367088607
10	The evaluation of robustness against adversarial manipulations of neural networks-based classifiers is mainly tested with empirical attacks as the methods for the exact computation, even when available, do not scale to large networks. We propose in this paper a new white-box adversarial attack wrt the $l_p$-norms for $p \in \{1,2,\infty\}$ aiming at finding the minimal perturbation necessary to change the class of a given input. It has an intuitive geometric meaning, yields quickly high quality results, minimizes the size of the perturbation (so that it returns the robust accuracy at every threshold with a single run). It performs better or similarly to state-of-the-art attacks which are partially specialized to one $l_p$-norm.	10	111	2	0	25	5.648648648648647
10	The backpropagation algorithm is the most popular algorithm training neural networks nowadays. However, it suffers from the forward locking, backward locking and update locking problems, especially when a neural network is so large that its layers are distributed across multiple devices. Existing solutions either can only handle one locking problem or lead to severe accuracy loss or memory inefficiency. Moreover, none of them consider the straggler problem among devices. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Layer-wise Staleness} and a novel efficient training algorithm, \textbf{Diversely Stale Parameters} (DSP), which can address all these challenges without loss of accuracy nor memory issue. We also analyze the convergence of DSP with two popular gradient-based methods and prove that both of them are guaranteed to converge to critical points for non-convex problems. Finally, extensive experimental results on training deep convolutional neural networks demonstrate that our proposed DSP algorithm can achieve significant training speedup with stronger robustness and better generalization than compared methods.	10	157	3	0	18	6.1528662420382165
10	Temporal Difference Learning with function approximation is known to be unstable. Previous work like \citet{sutton2009fast} and \citet{sutton2009convergent} has presented alternative objectives that are stable to minimize. However, in practice, TD-learning with neural networks requires various tricks like using a target network that updates slowly \citep{mnih2015human}. In this work we propose a constraint on the TD update that minimizes change to the target values. This constraint can be applied to the gradients of any TD objective, and can be easily applied to nonlinear function approximation. We validate this update by applying our technique to deep Q-learning, and training without a target network. We also show that adding this constraint on Baird's counterexample keeps Q-learning from diverging.	5	115	3	0	19	6.060869565217391
10	One of the fundamental tasks in understanding genomics is the problem of predicting Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs). With more than hundreds of Transcription Factors (TFs) as labels, genomic-sequence based TFBS prediction is a challenging multi-label classification task. There are two major biological mechanisms for TF binding: (1) sequence-specific binding patterns on genomes known as “motifs” and (2) interactions among TFs known as co-binding effects. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture, the Prototype Matching Network (PMN) to mimic the TF binding mechanisms. Our PMN model automatically extracts prototypes (“motif”-like features) for each TF through a novel prototype-matching loss. Borrowing ideas from few-shot matching models, we use the notion of support set of prototypes and an LSTM to learn how TFs interact and bind to genomic sequences. On a reference TFBS dataset with 2.1 million genomic sequences, PMN significantly outperforms baselines and validates our design choices empirically. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning architecture that introduces prototype learning and considers TF-TF interactions for large scale TFBS prediction. Not only is the proposed architecture accurate, but it also models the underlying biology.	9	186	6	0	20	5.924731182795699
10	"In this work we consider the problem of learning a classifier from noisy labels when a few clean labeled examples are given. The structure of clean and noisy data is modeled by a graph per class and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are used to predict class relevance of noisy examples. For each class, the GCN is treated as a binary classifier learning to discriminate clean from noisy examples using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function, and then the GCN-inferred ""clean"" probability is exploited as a relevance measure. Each noisy example is weighted by its relevance when learning a classifier for the end task. We evaluate our method on an extended version of a few-shot learning problem, where the few clean examples of novel classes are supplemented with additional noisy data. Experimental results show that our GCN-based cleaning process significantly improves the classification accuracy over not cleaning the noisy data and standard few-shot classification where only few clean examples are used. The proposed GCN-based method outperforms the transductive approach (Douze et al., 2018) that is using the same additional data without labels."	12	181	0	0	0	5.425414364640883
01	We propose Dynamically Pruned Message Passing Networks (DPMPN) for large-scale knowledge graph reasoning. In contrast to existing models, embedding-based or path-based, we learn an input-dependent subgraph to explicitly model a sequential reasoning process. Each subgraph is dynamically constructed, expanding itself selectively under a flow-style attention mechanism. In this way, we can not only construct graphical explanations to interpret prediction, but also prune message passing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to scale with the size of graphs. We take the inspiration from the consciousness prior proposed by Bengio to design a two-GNN framework to encode global input-invariant graph-structured representation and learn local input-dependent one coordinated by an attention module. Experiments show the reasoning capability in our model that is providing a clear graphical explanation as well as predicting results accurately, outperforming most state-of-the-art methods in knowledge base completion tasks.	10	138	3	1	18	6.369565217391305
10	Machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to poisoning attacks: An adversary can inject malicious points in the training dataset to influence the learning process and degrade the algorithm's performance. Optimal poisoning attacks have already been proposed to evaluate worst-case scenarios, modelling attacks as a bi-level optimization problem. Solving these problems is computationally demanding and has limited applicability for some models such as deep networks. In this paper we introduce a novel generative model to craft systematic poisoning attacks against machine learning classifiers generating adversarial training examples, i.e. samples that look like genuine data points but that degrade the classifier's accuracy when used for training. We propose a Generative Adversarial Net with three components: generator, discriminator, and the target classifier. This approach allows us to model naturally the detectability constrains that can be expected in realistic attacks and to identify the regions of the underlying data distribution that can be more vulnerable to data poisoning. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our attack to compromise machine learning classifiers, including deep networks.	6	170	3	0	24	6.2176470588235295
10	"Learning to imitate expert actions given demonstrations containing image observations is a difficult problem in robotic control. The key challenge is generalizing behavior to out-of-distribution states that differ from those in the demonstrations. State-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms perform well in environments with low-dimensional observations, but typically involve adversarial optimization procedures, which can be difficult to use with high-dimensional image observations. We propose a remarkably simple alternative based on off-policy soft Q-learning, which we call soft Q imitation learning (SQIL, pronounced ""skill""), that rewards the agent for matching demonstrated actions in demonstrated states. The key idea is initially filling the agent's experience replay buffer with demonstrations, where rewards are set to a positive constant, and setting rewards to zero in all additional experiences. We derive SQIL from first principles as a method for performing approximate inference under the MaxCausalEnt model of expert behavior. The approximate inference objective trades off between a pure behavioral cloning loss and a regularization term that incorporates information about state transitions via the soft Bellman error. Our experiments show that SQIL matches the state of the art in low-dimensional environments, and significantly outperforms prior work in playing video games from high-dimensional images."	10	195	2	0	28	6.343589743589742
10	This research paper describes a simplistic architecture named as AANN: Absolute Artificial Neural Network, which can be used to create highly interpretable representations of the input data. These representations are generated by penalizing the learning of the network in such a way that those learned representations correspond to the respective labels present in the labelled dataset used for supervised training; thereby, simultaneously giving the network the ability to classify the input data. The network can be used in the reverse direction to generate data that closely resembles the input by feeding in representation vectors as required. This research paper also explores the use of mathematical abs (absolute valued) functions as activation functions which constitutes the core part of this neural network architecture. Finally the results obtained on the MNIST dataset by using this technique are presented and discussed in brief.	5	140	4	0	29	5.735714285714287
10	Unsupervised landmark learning is the task of learning semantic keypoint-likerepresentations without the use of expensive keypoint-level annotations. A popular approach is to factorize an image into a pose and appearance data stream, then to reconstruct the image from the factorized components. The pose representation should capture a set of consistent and tightly localized landmarks in order to facilitate reconstruction of the input image. Ultimately, we wish for our learned landmarks to focus on the foreground object of interest. However, the reconstruction task of the entire image forces the model to allocate landmarks to model the background. This work explores the effects of factorizing the reconstruction task into separate foreground and background reconstructions, conditioning only the foreground reconstruction on the unsupervised landmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed factorization results in landmarks that are focused on the foreground object of interest. Furthermore, the rendered background quality is also improved, as the background rendering pipeline no longer requires the ill-suited landmarks to model its pose and appearance. We demonstrate this improvement in the context of the video-prediction.	11	176	1	0	0	6.090909090909091
10	It is usually hard for a learning system to predict correctly on the rare events, and there is no exception for segmentation algorithms. Therefore, we hope to build an alarm system to set off alarms when the segmentation result is possibly unsatisfactory. One plausible solution is to project the segmentation results into a low dimensional feature space, and then learn classifiers/regressors in the feature space to predict the qualities of segmentation results. In this paper, we form the feature space using shape feature which is a strong prior information shared among different data, so it is capable to predict the qualities of segmentation results given different segmentation algorithms on different datasets. The shape feature of a segmentation result is captured using the value of loss function when the segmentation result is tested using a Variational Auto-Encoder(VAE). The VAE is trained using only the ground truth masks, therefore the bad segmentation results with bad shapes become the rare events for VAE and will result in large loss value. By utilizing this fact, the VAE is able to detect all kinds of shapes that are out of the distribution of normal shapes in ground truth (GT). Finally, we learn the representation in the one-dimensional feature space to predict the qualities of segmentation results. We evaluate our alarm system on several recent segmentation algorithms for the medical segmentation task. The segmentation algorithms perform differently on different datasets, but our system consistently provides reliable prediction on the qualities of segmentation results.	10	247	3	0	12	5.497975708502024
10	This work explores the visual explanation for deep metric learning and its applications. As an important problem for learning representation, metric learning has attracted much attention recently, while the interpretation of such model is not as well studied as classification. To this end, we propose an intuitive idea to show where contributes the most to the overall similarity of two input images by decomposing the final activation. Instead of only providing the overall activation map of each image, we propose to generate point-to-point activation intensity between two images so that the relationship between different regions is uncovered. We show that the proposed framework can be directly deployed to a large range of metric learning applications and provides valuable information for understanding the model. Furthermore, our experiments show its effectiveness on two potential applications, i.e. cross-view pattern discovery and interactive retrieval. 	6	140	2	1	0	5.9
01	Adversarial examples raise questions about whether neural network models are sensitive to the same visual features as humans. In this paper, we first detect adversarial examples or otherwise corrupted images based on a class-conditional reconstruction of the input. To specifically attack our detection mechanism, we propose the Reconstructive Attack which seeks both to cause a misclassification and a low reconstruction error. This reconstructive attack produces undetected adversarial examples but with much smaller success rate. Among all these attacks, we find that CapsNets always perform better than convolutional networks. Then, we diagnose the adversarial examples for CapsNets and find that the success of the reconstructive attack is highly related to the visual similarity between the source and target class. Additionally, the resulting perturbations can cause the input image to appear visually more like the target class and hence become non-adversarial. This suggests that CapsNets use features that are more aligned with human perception and have the potential to address the central issue raised by adversarial examples.	9	165	2	0	0	5.903030303030302
10	Deep networks have achieved impressive results across a variety of important tasks. However, a known weakness is a failure to perform well when evaluated on data which differ from the training distribution, even if these differences are very small, as is the case with adversarial examples.  We propose \emph{Fortified Networks}, a simple transformation of existing networks, which “fortifies” the hidden layers in a deep network by identifying when the hidden states are off of the data manifold, and maps these hidden states back to parts of the data manifold where the network performs well. Our principal contribution is to show that fortifying these hidden states improves the robustness of deep networks and our experiments (i) demonstrate improved robustness to standard adversarial attacks in both black-box and white-box threat models; (ii) suggest that our improvements are not primarily due to the problem of deceptively good results due to degraded quality in the gradient signal (the gradient masking problem) and (iii) show the advantage of doing this fortification in the hidden layers instead of the input space.  We demonstrate improvements in adversarial robustness on three datasets (MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10), across several attack parameters, both white-box and black-box settings, and the most widely studied attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner).  We show that these improvements are achieved across a wide variety of hyperparameters.  	15	219	4	0	18	5.657534246575342
01	Bayesian learning of model parameters in neural networks is important in scenarios where estimates with well-calibrated uncertainty are important. In this paper, we propose Bayesian quantized networks (BQNs), quantized neural networks (QNNs) for which we learn a posterior distribution over their discrete parameters. We provide a set of efficient algorithms for learning and prediction in BQNs without the need to sample from their parameters or activations, which not only allows for differentiable learning in quantized models but also reduces the variance in gradients estimation. We evaluate BQNs on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and KMNIST classification datasets compared against bootstrap ensemble of QNNs (E-QNN). We demonstrate BQNs achieve both lower predictive errors and better-calibrated uncertainties than E-QNN (with less than 20% of the negative log-likelihood).	7	122	2	0	16	6.139344262295082
10	Recent work has shown that contextualized word representations derived from neural machine translation (NMT) are a viable alternative to such from simple word predictions tasks. This is because the internal understanding that needs to be built in order to be able to translate from one language to another is much more comprehensive. Unfortunately, computational and memory limitations as of present prevent NMT models from using large word vocabularies, and thus alternatives such as subword units (BPE and morphological segmentations) and characters have been used. Here we study the impact of using different kinds of units on the quality of the resulting representations when used to model syntax, semantics, and morphology.  We found that while representations derived from subwords are slightly better for modeling syntax, character-based representations are superior for modeling morphology and are also more robust to noisy input.	13	139	6	0	26	5.748201438848921
10	Learning at small or large scales of data is addressed by two strong but divided frontiers: few-shot learning and standard supervised learning. Few-shot learning focuses on sample efficiency at small scale, while supervised learning focuses on accuracy at large scale. Ideally they could be reconciled for effective learning at any number of data points (shot) and number of classes (way). To span the full spectrum of shot and way, we frame the variadic learning regime of learning from any number of inputs. We approach variadic learning by meta-learning a novel multi-modal clustering model that connects bayesian nonparametrics and deep metric learning. Our bayesian nonparametric deep embedding (BANDE) method is optimized end-to-end with a single objective, and adaptively adjusts capacity to learn from variable amounts of supervision. We show that multi-modality is critical for learning complex classes such as Omniglot alphabets and carrying out unsupervised clustering. We explore variadic learning by measuring generalization across shot and way between meta-train and meta-test, show the first results for scaling from few-way, few-shot tasks to 1692-way Omniglot classification and 5k-shot CIFAR-10 classification, and find that nonparametric methods generalize better than parametric methods. On the standard few-shot learning benchmarks of Omniglot and mini-ImageNet, BANDE equals or improves on the state-of-the-art for semi-supervised classification.	7	208	5	0	16	6.0625
01	Deep neural networks (DNNs) generalize remarkably well without explicit regularization even in the strongly over-parametrized regime  where classical learning theory would instead predict that they would severely overfit.  While many proposals for some kind of implicit regularization have been made to rationalise this success, there is no consensus for the fundamental reason why DNNs do not strongly overfit.  In this paper, we provide a new explanation. By applying a very general probability-complexity bound recently derived from  algorithmic information theory (AIT), we argue that the parameter-function map of many DNNs should be exponentially biased towards simple functions. We then provide clear evidence for this strong simplicity bias in a model DNN for Boolean functions, as well as in much larger fully connected and convolutional networks trained on CIFAR10 and MNIST.As the target functions in many real problems are expected to be highly structured, this intrinsic simplicity bias helps explain why deep networks generalize well on real world problems.This picture also facilitates a novel PAC-Bayes approach where the prior is taken over the DNN input-output function space, rather than  the more conventional prior over parameter space.  If we assume that the training algorithm samples parameters close to uniformly within the zero-error region then the PAC-Bayes theorem can be used to guarantee good expected generalization for target functions producing high-likelihood training sets.  By exploiting recently discovered connections between DNNs and Gaussian processes to estimate the marginal likelihood,  we produce relatively tight generalization PAC-Bayes error bounds which correlate well with the true error on realistic datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10 and for architectures including convolutional and fully connected networks.	12	268	6	0	25	5.925373134328357
10	Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used for classifying graph nodes in the semi-supervised setting.Previous works have shown that GCNs are vulnerable to the perturbation on adjacency and feature matrices of existing nodes. However, it is unrealistic to change the connections of  existing nodes in many applications, such as existing users in social networks. In this paper, we investigate methods attacking GCNs by adding fake nodes. A greedy algorithm is proposed to generate adjacency and feature matrices of fake nodes, aiming to minimize the classification accuracy on the existing ones. In additional, we introduce a discriminator to classify fake nodes from real nodes, and propose a Greedy-GAN algorithm to simultaneously update the discriminator and the attacker, to make fake nodes indistinguishable to the real ones.  Our non-targeted attack decreases the accuracy of GCN down to 0.10, and our targeted attack reaches a success rate of 0.99 for attacking the whole datasets, and 0.94 on average for attacking a single node.	8	162	3	0	10	5.4938271604938285
10	Sign gradient descent has become popular in machine learning due to its favorable communication cost in distributed optimization and its good performance in neural network training. However, we currently do not have a good understanding of which geometrical properties of the objective function determine the relative speed of sign gradient descent compared to standard gradient descent. In this work, we frame sign gradient descent as steepest descent with respect to the maximum norm. We review the steepest descent framework and the related concept of smoothness with respect to arbitrary norms.By studying the smoothness constant resulting from the $L^\infty$-geometry, we isolate properties of the objective which favor sign gradient descent relative to gradient descent. In short, we find two requirements on its Hessian: (i) some degree of ``diagonal dominance'' and (ii) the maximal eigenvalue being much larger than the average eigenvalue. We also clarify the meaning of a certain separable smoothness assumption used in previous analyses of sign gradient descent.Experiments verify the developed theory.	6	165	4	0	12	5.763636363636364
10	Hyperparameter optimization is both a practical issue and an interesting theoretical problem in training of deep architectures. Despite many recent advances the most commonly used methods almost universally involve training multiple and decoupled copies of the model, in effect sampling the hyperparameter space. We show that at a negligible additional computational cost, results can be improved by sampling \emph{nonlocal paths} instead of points in hyperparameter space. To this end we interpret hyperparameters as controlling the level of correlated noise in training, which can be mapped to an effective temperature. The usually independent instances of the model are coupled and allowed to exchange their hyperparameters throughout the training using the well established parallel tempering technique of statistical physics. Each simulation corresponds then to a unique path, or history, in the joint hyperparameter/model-parameter space. We provide empirical tests of our method, in particular for dropout and learning rate optimization. We observed faster training and improved resistance to overfitting and showed a systematic decrease in the absolute validation error, improving over benchmark results.	12	170	3	1	21	6.135294117647059
10	In this paper, we propose a neural network framework called neuron hierarchical network (NHN), that evolves beyond the hierarchy in layers, and concentrates on the hierarchy of neurons. We observe mass redundancy in the weights of both handcrafted and randomly searched architectures. Inspired by the development of human brains, we prune low-sensitivity neurons in the model and add new neurons to the graph, and the relation between individual neurons are emphasized and the existence of layers weakened. We propose a process to discover the best base model by random architecture search, and discover the best locations and connections of the added neurons by evolutionary search. Experiment results show that the NHN achieves higher test accuracy on Cifar-10 than state-of-the-art handcrafted and randomly searched architectures, while requiring much fewer parameters and less searching time.	3	133	3	0	30	5.74436090225564
01	We relate the minimax game of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to finding the saddle points of the Lagrangian function for a convex optimization problem, where the discriminator outputs and the distribution of generator outputs play the roles of primal variables and dual variables, respectively. This formulation shows the connection between the standard GAN training process and the primal-dual subgradient methods for convex optimization. The inherent connection does not only provide a theoretical convergence proof for training GANs in the function space, but also inspires a novel objective function for training. The modified objective function forces the distribution of generator outputs to be updated along the direction according to the primal-dual subgradient methods. A toy example shows that the proposed method is able to resolve mode collapse, which in this case cannot be avoided by the standard GAN or Wasserstein GAN. Experiments on both Gaussian mixture synthetic data and real-world image datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on generating diverse samples.	13	162	4	0	16	5.833333333333332
10	There are two major paradigms of white-box adversarial attacks that attempt to impose input perturbations.  The first paradigm, called the fix-perturbation attack, crafts adversarial samples within a given perturbation level.  The second paradigm, called the zero-confidence attack, finds the smallest perturbation needed to cause misclassification, also known as the margin of an input feature.  While the former paradigm is well-resolved, the latter is not.  Existing zero-confidence attacks either introduce significant approximation errors, or are too time-consuming.  We therefore propose MarginAttack, a zero-confidence attack framework that is able to compute the margin with improved accuracy and efficiency.  Our experiments show that MarginAttack is able to compute a smaller margin than the state-of-the-art zero-confidence attacks, and matches the state-of-the-art fix-perturbation attacks.  In addition, it runs significantly faster than the Carlini-Wagner attack, currently the most accurate zero-confidence attack algorithm.	7	136	2	0	11	6.595588235294117
01	It is widely believed that the success of deep convolutional networks is based on progressively discarding uninformative variability about the input with respect to the problem at hand. This is supported empirically by the difficulty of recovering images from their hidden representations, in most commonly used network architectures. In this paper we show via a one-to-one mapping that this loss of information is not a necessary condition to learn representations that generalize well on complicated problems, such as ImageNet. Via a cascade of homeomorphic layers, we build the $i$-RevNet, a network that can be fully inverted up to the final projection onto the classes, i.e. no information is discarded. Building an invertible architecture is difficult, for one, because the local inversion is ill-conditioned, we overcome this by providing an explicit inverse. An analysis of i-RevNet’s learned representations suggests an alternative explanation for the success of deep networks by a progressive contraction and linear separation with depth. To shed light on the nature of the model learned by the $i$-RevNet we reconstruct linear interpolations between natural image representations.	4	177	0	0	0	5.7344632768361565
10	State-of-the-art Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods learn transferable features by minimizing the feature distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains. Different from these methods which do not model the feature distributions explicitly, in this paper, we explore explicit feature distribution modeling for UDA. In particular, we propose Distribution Matching Prototypical Network (DMPN) to model the deep features from each domain as Gaussian mixture distributions. With explicit feature distribution modeling, we can easily measure the discrepancy between the two domains. In DMPN, we propose two new domain discrepancy losses with probabilistic interpretations. The first one minimizes the distances between the corresponding Gaussian component means of the source and target data. The second one minimizes the pseudo negative log likelihood of generating the target features from source feature distribution. To learn both discriminative and domain invariant features, DMPN is trained by minimizing the classification loss on the labeled source data and the domain discrepancy losses together. Extensive experiments are conducted over two UDA tasks. Our approach yields a large margin in the Digits Image transfer task over state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, DMPN obtains a mean accuracy of 81.4% on VisDA 2017 dataset. The hyper-parameter sensitivity analysis shows that our approach is robust w.r.t hyper-parameter changes.	8	204	3	0	33	6.200980392156862
01	The ability of algorithms to evolve or learn (compositional) communication protocols has traditionally been studied in the language evolution literature through the use of emergent communication tasks. Here we scale up this research by using contemporary deep learning methods and by training reinforcement-learning neural network agents on referential communication games. We extend previous work, in which agents were trained in symbolic environments, by developing agents which are able to learn from raw pixel data, a more challenging and realistic input representation. We find that the degree of structure found in the input data affects the nature of the emerged protocols, and thereby corroborate the hypothesis that structured compositional language is most likely to emerge when agents perceive the world as being structured.  	12	122	5	0	16	5.852459016393442
10	This paper presents a novel deep learning architecture for classifying structured objects in ultrafine-grained datasets, where classes may not be clearly distinguishable by their appearance but rather by their context. We model sequences of images as linear-chain CRFs, and jointly learn the parameters from both local-visual features and neighboring class information. The visual features are learned by convolutional layers, whereas class-structure information is reparametrized by factorizing the CRF pairwise potential matrix. This forms a context-based semantic similarity space, learned alongside the visual similarities, and dramatically increases the learning capacity of contextual information. This new parametrization, however, forms a highly nonlinear objective function which is challenging to optimize. To overcome this, we develop a novel surrogate likelihood which allows for a local likelihood approximation of the original CRF with integrated batch-normalization. This model overcomes the difficulties of existing CRF methods to learn the contextual relationships thoroughly when there is a large number of classes and the data is sparse. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated on a huge dataset that contains images of retail-store product displays, and shows significantly improved results compared to linear CRF parametrization, unnormalized likelihood optimization, and RNN modeling.	12	193	3	0	26	6.362694300518135
01	Classical models describe primary visual cortex (V1) as a filter bank of orientation-selective linear-nonlinear (LN) or energy models, but these models fail to predict neural responses to natural stimuli accurately. Recent work shows that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained to predict V1 activity more accurately, but it remains unclear which features are extracted by V1 neurons beyond orientation selectivity and phase invariance. Here we work towards systematically studying V1 computations by categorizing neurons into groups that perform similar computations. We present a framework for identifying common features independent of individual neurons' orientation selectivity by using a rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network, which automatically extracts every feature at multiple different orientations. We fit this rotation-equivariant CNN to responses of a population of 6000 neurons to natural images recorded in mouse primary visual cortex using two-photon imaging. We show that our rotation-equivariant network outperforms a regular CNN with the same number of feature maps and reveals a number of common features, which are shared by many V1 neurons and are pooled sparsely to predict neural activity. Our findings are a first step towards a powerful new tool to study the nonlinear functional organization of visual cortex.	10	195	6	0	17	5.994871794871795
01	We study the behavior of weight-tied multilayer vanilla autoencoders under the assumption of random weights. Via an exact characterization in the limit of large dimensions, our analysis reveals interesting phase transition phenomena when the depth becomes large. This, in particular, provides quantitative answers and insights to three questions that were yet fully understood in the literature. Firstly, we provide a precise answer on how the random deep weight-tied autoencoder model performs “approximate inference” as posed by Scellier et al. (2018), and its connection to reversibility considered by several theoretical studies. Secondly, we show that deep autoencoders display a higher degree of sensitivity to perturbations in the parameters, distinct from the shallow counterparts. Thirdly, we obtain insights on pitfalls in training initialization practice, and demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to train a deep autoencoder, even with the tanh activation and a depth as large as 200 layers, without resorting to techniques such as layer-wise pre-training or batch normalization. Our analysis is not specific to any depths or any Lipschitz activations, and our analytical techniques may have broader applicability.	14	178	3	0	32	5.943820224719101
10	We propose a general framework to construct unsupervised models capable of learning distributed representations of discrete structures such as graphs based on R-Convolution kernels and distributed semantics research. Our framework combines the insights and observations of Deep Graph Kernels and Graph2Vec towards a unified methodology for performing similarity learning on graphs of arbitrary size. This is exemplified by our own instance G2DR which extends Graph2Vec from labelled graphs towards unlabelled graphs and tackles issues of diagonal dominance through pruning of the subgraph vocabulary composing graphs. These changes produce new state of the art results in the downstream application of G2DR embeddings in graph classification tasks over datasets with small labelled graphs in binary classification to multi-class classification on large unlabelled graphs using an off-the-shelf support vector machine. 	9	127	3	1	21	6.228346456692913
10	This paper analyzes how generalization works in meta-learning. Our core contribution is an information-theoretic generalization bound for meta-learning, which identifies the expressivity of the task-specific learner as the key factor that makes generalization to new datasets difficult. Taking inspiration from our bound, we present Discrete InfoMax Codes (DIMCO), a novel meta-learning model that trains a stochastic encoder to output discrete codes. Experiments show that DIMCO requires less memory and less time for similar performance to previous metric learning methods and that our method generalizes particularly well in a challenging small-data setting.	5	91	3	0	15	6.274725274725275
01	One of the long-standing challenges in Artificial Intelligence for learning goal-directed behavior is to build a single agent which can solve multiple tasks. Recent progress in multi-task learning for goal-directed sequential problems has been in the form of distillation based learning wherein a student network learns from multiple task-specific expert networks by mimicking the task-specific policies of the expert networks. While such approaches offer a promising solution to the multi-task learning problem, they require supervision from large expert networks which require extensive data and computation time for training.In this work, we propose an efficient multi-task learning framework which solves multiple goal-directed tasks in an on-line setup without the need for expert supervision. Our work uses active learning principles to achieve multi-task learning by sampling the harder tasks more than the easier ones. We propose three distinct models under our active sampling framework. An adaptive method with extremely competitive multi-tasking performance. A UCB-based meta-learner which casts the problem of picking the next task to train on as a multi-armed bandit problem. A meta-learning method that casts the next-task picking problem as a full Reinforcement Learning problem and uses actor-critic methods for optimizing the multi-tasking performance directly. We demonstrate results in the Atari 2600 domain on seven multi-tasking instances: three 6-task instances, one 8-task instance, two 12-task instances and one 21-task instance.	6	221	1	0	20	6.0361990950226225
10	Face completion is a challenging conditional image synthesis task. This paper proposes controllable and interpretable high-resolution and fast face completion by learning generative adversarial networks (GANs) progressively from low resolution to high resolution. We present structure-aware and frequency-oriented attentive GANs. The proposed structure-aware component leverages off-the-shelf facial landmark detectors and proposes a simple yet effective  method of integrating the detected landmarks in generative learning. It facilitates facial expression transfer together with facial attributes control, and helps regularize the structural consistency in progressive training. The proposed  frequency-oriented attentive module (FOAM) encourages GANs to attend to only finer details in the coarse-to-fine progressive training, thus enabling progressive attention to face structures. The learned FOAMs show a strong pattern of switching its attention from low-frequency to high-frequency signals. In experiments, the proposed method is tested on the CelebA-HQ benchmark. Experiment results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art face completion methods. The proposed method is also fast with mean inference time of 0.54 seconds for images at 1024x1024 resolution (using a Titan Xp GPU).	12	170	5	0	11	6.647058823529411
01	The impressive performance of neural networks on natural language processing tasks attributes to their ability to model complicated word and phrase compositions. To explain how the model handles semantic compositions, we study hierarchical explanation of neural network predictions. We identify non-additivity and context independent importance attributions within hierarchies as two desirable properties for highlighting word and phrase compositions. We show some prior efforts on hierarchical explanations, e.g. contextual decomposition, do not satisfy the desired properties mathematically, leading to inconsistent explanation quality in different models. In this paper, we start by proposing a formal and general way to quantify the importance of each word and phrase. Following the formulation, we propose Sampling and Contextual Decomposition (SCD) algorithm and Sampling and Occlusion (SOC) algorithm. Human and metrics evaluation on both LSTM models and BERT Transformer models on multiple datasets show that our algorithms outperform prior hierarchical explanation algorithms. Our algorithms help to visualize semantic composition captured by models, extract classification rules and improve human trust of models.	11	165	2	0	16	6.418181818181817
10	When applying machine learning to sensitive data one has to balance between accuracy, information leakage, and computational-complexity. Recent studies have shown that Homomorphic Encryption (HE) can be used for protecting against information leakage while applying neural networks. However, this comes with the cost of limiting the kind of neural networks that can be used (and hence the accuracy) and with latency of the order of several minutes even for relatively simple networks. In this study we improve on previous results both in the kind of networks that can be applied and in terms of the latency. Most of the improvement is achieved by novel ways to represent the data to make better use of the capabilities of the encryption scheme.	5	120	4	0	22	5.208333333333333
10	Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative to current artificial neural networks to enable low-power event-driven neuromorphic hardware. However, training SNNs remains a challenge primarily because of the complex non-differentiable neuronal behavior arising from their spike-based computation. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to train spiking autoencoders on regenerative learning tasks. A sigmoid approximation is used in place of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron's threshold based activation during backpropagation to enable differentiability. The loss is computed on the membrane potential of the output layer, which is then backpropagated through the network at each time step. These spiking autoencoders learn meaningful spatio-temporal representations of the data, across two modalities - audio and visual. We demonstrate audio to image synthesis in a spike-based environment by sharing these spatio-temporal representations between the two modalities. These models achieve very low reconstruction loss, comparable to ANNs, on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, and while converting TI-46 digits audio samples to MNIST images. 	6	157	5	0	0	6.388535031847134
10	Although Adam is a very popular algorithm for optimizing the weights of neural networks, it has been recently shown that it can diverge even in simple convex optimization examples. Therefore, several variants of Adam have been proposed to circumvent this convergence issue. In this work, we study the algorithm for smooth nonconvex optimization under a boundedness assumption on the adaptive learning rate. The bound on the adaptive step size depends on the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of the objective function and provides safe theoretical adaptive step sizes. Under this boundedness assumption, we show a novel first order convergence rate result in both deterministic and stochastic contexts. Furthermore, we establish convergence rates of the function value sequence using the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property.	13	121	2	0	0	5.768595041322314
10	Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a common method for transferring the ``knowledge'' learned by one machine learning model (the teacher) into another model (the student), where typically, the teacher has a greater capacity (e.g., more parameters or higher bit-widths). To our knowledge, existing methods overlook the fact that although the student absorbs extra knowledge from the teacher, both models share the same input data -- and this data is the only medium by which the teacher's knowledge can be demonstrated. Due to the difference in model capacities, the student may not benefit fully from the same data points on which the teacher is trained. On the other hand, a human teacher may demonstrate a piece of knowledge with individualized examples adapted to a particular student, for instance, in terms of her cultural background and interests. Inspired by this behavior, we design data augmentation agents with distinct roles to facilitate knowledge distillation. Our data augmentation agents generate distinct training data for the teacher and student, respectively. We focus specifically on KD when the teacher network has greater precision (bit-width) than the student network.We find empirically that specially tailored data points enable the teacher's knowledge to be demonstrated more effectively to the student. We compare our approach with existing KD methods on training popular neural architectures and demonstrate that role-wise data augmentation improves the effectiveness of KD over strong prior approaches. The code for reproducing our results will be made publicly available.	6	240	2	1	24	5.658333333333332
10	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a very powerful framework for generative modeling. However, they are often hard to train, and learning of GANs often becomes unstable. Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) is a promising framework to deal with the instability problem as it has a good convergence property. One drawback of the WGAN is that it evaluates the Wasserstein distance in the dual domain, which requires some approximation, so that it may fail to optimize the true Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we propose evaluating the exact empirical optimal transport cost efficiently in the primal domain and performing gradient descent with respect to its derivative to train the generator network. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show that our method is significantly stable to converge, and achieves the lowest Wasserstein distance among the WGAN variants at the cost of some sharpness of generated images. Experiments on the 8-Gaussian toy dataset show that better gradients for the generator are obtained in our method. In addition, the proposed method enables more flexible generative modeling than WGAN.	9	171	4	0	17	5.497076023391813
01	Recurrent neural networks have achieved excellent performance in many applications. However, on portable devices with limited resources, the models are often too large to deploy. For applications on the server with large scale concurrent requests, the latency during inference can also be very critical for costly computing resources. In this work, we address these problems by quantizing the network, both weights and activations, into multiple binary codes {-1,+1}. We formulate the quantization as an optimization problem. Under the key observation that once the quantization coefficients are fixed the binary codes can be derived efficiently by binary search tree, alternating minimization is then applied.  We test the quantization for two well-known RNNs, i.e., long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), on the language models. Compared with the full-precision counter part, by 2-bit quantization we can achieve ~16x memory saving and  ~6x real inference acceleration on CPUs, with only a reasonable loss in the accuracy. By 3-bit quantization, we can achieve almost no loss in the accuracy or even surpass the original model, with ~10.5x memory saving and ~3x real inference acceleration. Both results beat the exiting quantization works with large margins.  We extend our alternating quantization to image classification tasks. In both RNNs and feedforward neural networks, the method also achieves  excellent performance.	7	215	3	0	17	5.730232558139536
01	Standard variational lower bounds used to train latent variable models produce biased estimates of most quantities of interest. We introduce an unbiased estimator of the log marginal likelihood and its gradients for latent variable models based on randomized truncation of infinite series. If parameterized by an encoder-decoder architecture, the parameters of the encoder can be optimized to minimize its variance of this estimator. We show that models trained using our estimator give better test-set likelihoods than a standard importance-sampling based approach for the same average computational cost. This estimator also allows use of latent variable models for tasks where unbiased estimators, rather than marginal likelihood lower bounds, are preferred, such as minimizing reverse KL divergences and estimating score functions.	11	119	0	0	22	6.025210084033612
10	One can substitute each neuron in any neural network with a kernel machine and obtain a counterpart powered by kernel machines. The new network inherits the expressive power and architecture of the original but works in a more intuitive way since each node enjoys the simple interpretation as a hyperplane (in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space). Further, using the kernel multilayer perceptron as an example, we prove that in classification, an optimal representation that minimizes the risk of the network can be characterized for each hidden layer. This result removes the need of backpropagation in learning the model and can be generalized to any feedforward kernel network. Moreover, unlike backpropagation, which turns models into black boxes, the optimal hidden representation enjoys an intuitive geometric interpretation, making the dynamics of learning in a deep kernel network simple to understand. Empirical results are provided to validate our theory.	6	146	3	0	24	5.6095890410958935

Even though the missing completely at random setting may seem naive, it is actually how knowledge graph embedding methods are typically benchmarked in the literature. Our results provide, to certain extent, an explanation for why knowledge graph embedding methods work (as much as classical learning theory results provide explanations for classical learning from i.i.d. data).	9	81	2	0	18	6.0123456790123475
01	Training neural networks with verifiable robustness guarantees is challenging. Several existing approaches utilize linear relaxation based neural network output bounds under perturbation, but they can slow down training by a factor of hundreds depending on the underlying network architectures. Meanwhile, interval bound propagation (IBP) based training is efficient and significantly outperforms linear relaxation based methods on many tasks, yet it may suffer from stability issues since the bounds are much looser especially at the beginning of training. In this paper, we propose a new certified adversarial training method, CROWN-IBP, by combining the fast IBP bounds in a forward bounding pass and a tight linear relaxation based bound, CROWN, in a backward bounding pass. CROWN-IBP is computationally efficient and consistently outperforms IBP baselines on training verifiably robust neural networks. We conduct large scale experiments on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, and outperform all previous linear relaxation and bound propagation based certified defenses in L_inf robustness.Notably, we achieve 7.02% verified test error on MNIST at epsilon=0.3, and 66.94% on CIFAR-10 with epsilon=8/255.	10	170	3	1	18	6.0588235294117645
10	Recent neural network and language models have begun to rely on softmax distributions with an extremely large number of categories. In this context calculating the softmax normalizing constant is prohibitively expensive. This has spurred a growing literature of efficiently computable but biased estimates of the softmax. In this paper we present the first two unbiased algorithms for maximizing the softmax likelihood whose work per iteration is independent of the number of classes and datapoints (and does not require extra work at the end of each epoch). We compare our unbiased methods' empirical performance to the state-of-the-art on seven real world datasets, where they comprehensively outperform all competitors.	4	107	3	0	22	5.757009345794393
10	Despite the impressive performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) on numerous learning  tasks, they still exhibit uncouth behaviours. One puzzling behaviour is the subtle sensitive reaction of DNNs to various noise attacks. Such a nuisance has strengthened the line of research around developing and training noise-robust networks. In this work, we propose a new training regularizer that aims to minimize the probabilistic expected training loss of a DNN subject to a generic Gaussian input. We provide an efficient and simple approach to approximate such a regularizer for arbitrarily deep networks. This is done by leveraging the analytic expression of the output mean of a shallow neural network, avoiding the need for memory and computation expensive data augmentation. We conduct extensive experiments on LeNet and AlexNet on various datasets including MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed regularizer. In particular, we show that networks that are trained with the proposed regularizer benefit from a boost in robustness against Gaussian noise to an equivalent amount of performing 3-21 folds of noisy data augmentation. Moreover, we empirically show on several architectures and datasets that improving robustness against Gaussian noise, by using the new regularizer, can improve the overall robustness against 6 other types of attacks by two orders of magnitude.	7	211	3	1	17	5.691943127962087
01	Achieving faster execution with shorter compilation time can foster further diversity and innovation in neural networks. However, the current paradigm of executing neural networks either relies on hand-optimized libraries, traditional compilation heuristics, or very recently genetic algorithms and other stochastic methods. These methods suffer from frequent costly hardware measurements rendering them not only too time consuming but also suboptimal. As such, we devise a solution that can learn to quickly adapt to a previously unseen design space for code optimization, both accelerating the search and improving the output performance. This solution dubbed Chameleon leverages reinforcement learning whose solution takes fewer steps to converge, and develops an adaptive sampling algorithm that not only focuses on the costly samples (real hardware measurements) on representative points but also uses a domain-knowledge inspired logic to improve the samples itself. Experimentation with real hardware shows that Chameleon provides 4.45x speed up in optimization time over AutoTVM, while also improving inference time of the modern deep networks by 5.6%.	10	163	8	0	12	6.116564417177916
10	Modern learning models are characterized by large hyperparameter spaces. In order to adequately explore these large spaces, we must evaluate a large number of configurations, typically orders of magnitude more configurations than available parallel workers.   Given the growing costs of model training, we would ideally like to perform this search in roughly the same wall-clock time needed to train a single model. In this work, we tackle this challenge by introducing ASHA, a simple and robust hyperparameter tuning algorithm with solid theoretical underpinnings that exploits parallelism and aggressive early-stopping.  Our extensive empirical results show that ASHA outperforms state-of-the-art hyperparameter tuning methods; scales linearly with the number of workers in distributed settings; converges to a high quality configuration in half the time taken by Vizier, Google's internal hyperparameter tuning service) in an experiment with 500 workers; and beats the published result for a near state-of-the-art LSTM architecture in under $2\times$ the time to train a single model.	4	156	2	0	0	5.9551282051282035
01	Deep neural networks are surprisingly efficient at solving practical tasks,but the theory behind this phenomenon is only starting to catch up withthe practice. Numerous works show that depth is the key to this efficiency.A certain class of deep convolutional networks – namely those that correspondto the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor decomposition – has beenproven to have exponentially higher expressive power than shallow networks.I.e. a shallow network of exponential width is required to realizethe same score function as computed by the deep architecture. In this paper,we prove the expressive power theorem (an exponential lower bound onthe width of the equivalent shallow network) for a class of recurrent neuralnetworks – ones that correspond to the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition.This means that even processing an image patch by patch with an RNNcan be exponentially more efficient than a (shallow) convolutional networkwith one hidden layer. Using theoretical results on the relation betweenthe tensor decompositions we compare expressive powers of the HT- andTT-Networks. We also implement the recurrent TT-Networks and providenumerical evidence of their expressivity.	6	186	4	0	12	5.456989247311828
01	We propose procedures for evaluating and strengthening contextual embedding alignment and show that they are useful in analyzing and improving multilingual BERT. In particular, after our proposed alignment procedure, BERT exhibits significantly improved zero-shot performance on XNLI compared to the base model, remarkably matching pseudo-fully-supervised translate-train models for Bulgarian and Greek. Further, to measure the degree of alignment, we introduce a contextual version of word retrieval and show that it correlates well with downstream zero-shot transfer. Using this word retrieval task, we also analyze BERT and find that it exhibits systematic deficiencies, e.g. worse alignment for open-class parts-of-speech and word pairs written in different scripts, that are corrected by the alignment procedure. These results support contextual alignment as a useful concept for understanding large multilingual pre-trained models.	6	127	6	0	28	6.3858267716535435
10	We propose a model that learns to perform zero-shot classification using a meta-learner that is trained to produce a correction to the output of a previously trained learner. The model consists of two modules: a task module that supplies an initial prediction, and a correction module that updates the initial prediction. The task module is the learner and the correction module is the meta-learner. The correction module is trained in an episodic approach whereby many different task modules are trained on various subsets of the total training data, with the rest being used as unseen data for the correction module. The correction module takes as input a representation of the task module's training data so that the predicted correction is a function of the task module's training data.  The correction module is trained to update the task module's prediction to be closer to the target value. This approach leads to state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot classification on natural language class descriptions on the CUB and NAB datasets. 	6	166	4	0	22	5.301204819277109
10	Acceleration for reinforcement learning methods is an important and challenging theme. We introduce the Anderson acceleration technique into the value iteration, developing an accelerated value iteration algorithm that we call Anderson Accelerated Value Iteration (A2VI). We further apply our method to the Deep Q-learning algorithm, resulting in the Deep Anderson Accelerated Q-learning (DA2Q) algorithm. Our approach can be viewed as an approximation of the policy evaluation by interpolating on historical data. A2VI is more efficient than the modified policy iteration, which is a classical approximate method for policy evaluation. We give a theoretical analysis of our algorithm and conduct experiments on both toy problems and Atari games. Both the theoretical and empirical results show the effectiveness of our algorithm.	6	119	1	0	0	5.983193277310924
10	Inspired by the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in image domains, we introduce a novel hierarchical architecture for learning characteristic topological features from a single arbitrary input graph via GANs. The hierarchical architecture consisting of multiple GANs preserves both local and global topological features, and automatically partitions the input graph into representative stages for feature learning. The stages facilitate reconstruction and can be used as indicators of the importance of the associated topological structures. Experiments show that our method produces subgraphs retaining a wide range of topological features, even in early reconstruction stages. This paper contains original research on combining the use of GANs and graph topological analysis.	5	109	4	0	14	6.293577981651376
10	Graph neural networks have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to naturally encode relational input data and their ability to operate on large graphs by using a sparse representation of graph adjacency matrices. As we look to scale up these models using custom hardware, a natural assumption would be that we need hardware tailored to sparse operations and/or dynamic control flow. In this work, we question this assumption by scaling up sparse graph neural networks using a platform targeted at dense computation on fixed-size data. Drawing inspiration from optimization of numerical algorithms on sparse matrices, we develop techniques that enable training the sparse graph neural network model from Allamanis et al. (2018) in 13 minutes using a 512-core TPUv2 Pod, whereas the original training takes almost a day.	10	132	0	1	33	5.416666666666668
10	 State-of-the-art deep learning methods for outlier detection make the assumption that anomalies will appear far away from inlier data in the latent space produced by distribution mapping deep networks. However, this assumption fails in practice, because the divergence penalty adopted for this purpose encourages mapping outliers into the same high-probability regions as inliers. To overcome this shortcoming,  we introduce a novel deep learning outlier detection method, called Outlier Preserving Distribution Mapping Autoencoder (OP-DMA), which succeeds to map outliers to low probability regions in the latent space of an autoencoder. For this we leverage the insight that outliers are likely to have a higher reconstruction error than inliers. We thus achieve outlier-preserving distribution mapping through weighting the reconstruction error of individual points by the value of a multivariate Gaussian probability density function evaluated at those points. This weighting implies that outliers will result overall penalty if they are mapped to low-probability regions. We show that if the  global minimum of our newly proposed loss function is achieved,  then our OP-DMA  maps inliers to regions with a Mahalanobis distance less than delta, and outliers to regions past this delta, delta being the inverse Chi Squared CDF evaluated at (1-alpha) with alpha the percentage of outliers in the dataset. Our experiments confirm that OP-DMA  consistently outperforms  the state-of-art  methods on a rich variety of outlier detection benchmark datasets.	9	225	5	0	17	5.88
10	The worst-case training principle that minimizes the maximal adversarial loss, also known as adversarial training (AT), has shown to be a state-of-the-art approach for enhancing adversarial robustness against norm-ball bounded input perturbations. Nonetheless, min-max optimization beyond the purpose of AT has not been rigorously explored in the research of adversarial attack and defense. In particular, given a set of risk sources (domains), minimizing the maximal loss induced from the domain set can be reformulated as a general min-max problem that is different from AT. Examples of this general formulation include attacking model ensembles, devising universal perturbation under multiple inputs or data transformations, and generalized AT over different types of attack models. We show that these problems can be solved under a unified and theoretically principled min-max optimization framework.  We also show that the self-adjusted domain weights learned from our method provides a means to explain the difficulty level of attack and defense over multiple domains. Extensive experiments show that our approach leads to substantial performance improvement over the conventional averaging strategy.	10	171	3	0	10	6.052631578947367
10	It has been common to argue or imply that a regularizer can be used to alter a statistical property of a hidden layer's representation and thus improve generalization or performance of deep networks. For instance, dropout has been known to improve performance by reducing co-adaptation, and representational sparsity has been argued as a good characteristic because many data-generation processes have only a small number of factors that are independent. In this work, we analytically and empirically investigate the popular characteristics of learned representations, including correlation, sparsity, dead unit, rank, and mutual information, and disprove many of the \textit{conventional wisdom}. We first show that infinitely many Identical Output Networks (IONs) can be constructed for any deep network with a linear layer, where any invertible affine transformation can be applied to alter the layer's representation characteristics. The existence of ION proves that the correlation characteristics of representation can be either low or high for a well-performing network. Extensions to ReLU layers are provided, too. Then, we consider sparsity, dead unit, and rank to show that only loose relationships exist among the three characteristics. It is shown that a higher sparsity or additional dead units do not imply a better or worse performance when the rank of representation is fixed. We also develop a rank regularizer and show that neither representation sparsity nor lower rank is helpful for improving performance even when the data-generation process has only a small number of independent factors. Mutual information $I(\z_l;\x)$ and $I(\z_l;\y)$ are investigated as well, and we show that regularizers can affect $I(\z_l;\x)$ and thus indirectly influence the performance. Finally, we explain how a rich set of regularizers can be used as a powerful tool for performance tuning. 	10	282	4	0	0	5.716312056737587
10	A number of techniques for interpretability have been presented for deep learningin computer vision, typically with the goal of understanding what it is that the networkshave actually learned underneath a given classification decision. However,when it comes to deep video architectures, interpretability is still in its infancy andwe do not yet have a clear concept of how we should decode spatiotemporal features.In this paper, we present a study comparing how 3D convolutional networksand convolutional LSTM networks respectively learn features across temporallydependent frames. This is the first comparison of two video models that bothconvolve to learn spatial features but that have principally different methods ofmodeling time. Additionally, we extend the concept of meaningful perturbationintroduced by Fong & Vedaldi (2017) to the temporal dimension to search for themost meaningful part of a sequence for a classification decision.	13	145	6	1	26	5.5793103448275865
01	Transformer has become ubiquitous in natural language processing (e.g., machine translation, question answering); however, it requires enormous amount of computations to achieve high performance, which makes it not suitable for mobile applications that are tightly constrained by the hardware resources and battery. In this paper, we present an efficient mobile NLP architecture, Lite Transformer to facilitate deploying mobile NLP applications on edge devices. The key primitive is the Long-Short Range Attention (LSRA), where one group of heads specializes in the local context modeling (by convolution) while another group specializes in the long-distance relationship modeling (by attention). Such specialization brings consistent improvement over the vanilla transformer on three well-established language tasks: machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling. Under constrained resources (500M/100M MACs), Lite Transformer outperforms transformer on WMT'14 English-French by 1.2/1.7 BLEU, respectively. Lite Transformer reduces the computation of transformer base model by 2.5x with 0.3 BLEU score degradation. Combining with pruning and quantization, we further compressed the model size of Lite Transformer by 18.2x. For language modeling, Lite Transformer achieves 1.8 lower perplexity than the transformer at around 500M MACs. Notably, Lite Transformer outperforms the AutoML-based Evolved Transformer by 0.5 higher BLEU for the mobile NLP setting without the costly architecture search that requires more than 250 GPU years. Code has been made available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/lite-transformer.	6	217	2	0	0	6.557603686635945
01	We present a simple and effective algorithm designed to address the covariate shift problem in imitation learning. It operates by training an ensemble of policies on the expert demonstration data, and using the variance of their predictions as a cost which is minimized with RL together with a supervised behavioral cloning cost. Unlike adversarial imitation methods, it uses a fixed reward function which is easy to optimize. We prove a regret bound for the algorithm which is linear in the time horizon multiplied by a coefficient which we show to be low for certain problems in which behavioral cloning fails. We evaluate our algorithm empirically across multiple pixel-based Atari environments and continuous control tasks, and show that it matches or significantly outperforms behavioral cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning.	3	129	3	0	11	5.573643410852712
10	Online healthcare services can provide the general public with ubiquitous access to medical knowledge and reduce the information access cost for both individuals and societies. To promote these benefits, it is desired to effectively expand the scale of high-quality yet novel relational medical entity pairs that embody rich medical knowledge in a structured form. To fulfill this goal, we introduce a generative model called Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE), which can discover meaningful and novel relational medical entity pairs without the requirement of additional external knowledge. Rather than discriminatively identifying the relationship between two given medical entities in a free-text corpus, we directly model and understand medical relationships from diversely expressed medical entity pairs. The proposed model introduces the generative modeling capacity of variational autoencoder to entity pairs, and has the ability to discover new relational medical entity pairs solely based on the existing entity pairs. Beside entity pairs, relationship-enhanced entity representations are obtained as another appealing benefit of the proposed method. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real-world medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating relational medical entity pairs that are meaningful and novel.	7	189	4	0	30	6.349206349206349
01	State-of-the-art models are now trained with billions of parameters, reaching hardware limits in terms of memory consumption. This has created a recent demand for memory-efficient optimizers. To this end, we investigate the limits and performance tradeoffs of memory-efficient adaptively preconditioned gradient methods. We propose \emph{extreme tensoring} for high-dimensional stochastic optimization, showing that an optimizer needs very little memory to benefit from adaptive preconditioning. Our technique applies to arbitrary models (not necessarily with tensor-shaped parameters), and is accompanied by regret and convergence guarantees, which shed light on the tradeoffs between preconditioner quality and expressivity. On a large-scale NLP model, we reduce the optimizer memory overhead by three orders of magnitude, without degrading performance.	5	112	2	0	0	6.642857142857142
01	We provide a framework for incorporating robustness -- to perturbations in the transition dynamics which we refer to as model misspecification -- into continuous control Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. We specifically focus on incorporating robustness into a state-of-the-art continuous control RL algorithm called Maximum a-posteriori Policy Optimization (MPO). We achieve this by learning a policy that optimizes for a worst case, entropy-regularized, expected return objective and derive a corresponding robust entropy-regularized Bellman contraction operator. In addition, we introduce a less conservative, soft-robust, entropy-regularized objective with a corresponding Bellman operator. We show that both, robust and soft-robust policies, outperform their non-robust counterparts in nine Mujoco domains with environment perturbations. In addition, we show improved robust performance on a challenging, simulated, dexterous robotic hand. Finally, we present multiple investigative experiments that provide a deeper insight into the robustness framework; including an adaptation to another continuous control RL algorithm.

10	It has been shown that instead of learning actual object features, deep networks tend to exploit non-robust (spurious) discriminative features that are shared between training and test sets. Therefore, while they achieve state of the art performance on such test sets, they achieve poor generalization on out of distribution (OOD) samples where the IID (independent, identical distribution) assumption breaks and the distribution of non-robust features shifts. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this happens because maximum likelihood training (without appropriate regularization) leads the model to depend on all the correlations (including spurious ones) present between inputs and targets in the dataset. We then show evidence that the information bottleneck (IB) principle can address this problem. To do so, we propose a regularization approach based on IB called Entropy Penalty, that reduces the model's dependence on spurious features-- features corresponding to such spurious correlations. This allows deep networks trained with Entropy Penalty to generalize well even under distribution shift of spurious features. As a controlled test-bed for evaluating our claim, we train deep networks with Entropy Penalty on a colored MNIST (C-MNIST) dataset and show that it is able to generalize well on vanilla MNIST, MNIST-M and SVHN datasets in addition to an OOD version of C-MNIST itself. The baseline regularization methods we compare against fail to generalize on this test-bed.	8	222	4	1	27	5.797297297297297
10	Transfer reinforcement learning (RL) aims at improving learning efficiency of an agent by exploiting knowledge from other source agents trained on relevant tasks. However, it remains challenging to transfer knowledge between different environmental dynamics without having access to the source environments. In this work, we explore a new challenge in transfer RL, where only a set of source policies collected under unknown diverse dynamics is available for learning a target task efficiently. To address this problem, the proposed approach, MULTI-source POLicy AggRegation (MULTIPOLAR), comprises two key techniques. We learn to aggregate the actions provided by the source policies adaptively to maximize the target task performance. Meanwhile, we learn an auxiliary network that predicts residuals around the aggregated actions, which ensures the target policy's expressiveness even when some of the source policies perform poorly. We demonstrated the effectiveness of MULTIPOLAR through an extensive experimental evaluation across six simulated environments ranging from classic control problems to challenging robotics simulations, under both continuous and discrete action spaces.	12	164	4	1	29	6.243902439024391
01	Deep reinforcement learning is successful in decision making for sophisticated games, such as Atari, Go, etc. However, real-world decision making often requires reasoning with partial information extracted from complex visual observations. This paper presents  Discriminative Particle Filter Reinforcement Learning (DPFRL), a new reinforcement learning framework for complex partial observations. DPFRL encodes a differentiable particle filter in the neural network policy for explicit reasoning with partial observations over time. The particle filter maintains a belief using learned discriminative update, which is trained end-to-end for decision making. We show that using the discriminative update instead of standard generative models results in significantly improved performance, especially for tasks with complex visual observations, because they circumvent the difficulty of modeling complex observations that are irrelevant to decision making.In addition, to extract features from the particle belief, we propose a new type of belief feature based on the moment generating function. DPFRL outperforms state-of-the-art POMDP RL models in Flickering Atari Games, an existing POMDP RL benchmark, and in Natural Flickering Atari Games, a new, more challenging POMDP RL benchmark introduced in this paper.  Further,  DPFRL performs well for visual navigation with real-world data in the Habitat environment.	9	193	3	0	18	6.3160621761658025
01	Music relies heavily on repetition to build structure and meaning.  Self-reference occurs on multiple timescales, from motifs to phrases to reusing of entire sections of music, such as in pieces with ABA structure.  The Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), a sequence model based on self-attention, has achieved compelling results in many generation tasks that require maintaining long-range coherence. This suggests that self-attention might also be well-suited to modeling music. In musical composition and performance, however, relative timing is critically important.  Existing approaches for representing relative positional information in the Transformer modulate attention based on pairwise distance (Shaw et al., 2018).  This is impractical for long sequences such as musical compositions since their memory complexity is quadratic in the sequence length.  We propose an algorithm that reduces the intermediate memory requirements to linear in the sequence length. This enables us to demonstrate that a Transformer with our modified relative attention mechanism can generate minute-long (thousands of steps) compositions with compelling structure, generate continuations that coherently elaborate on a given motif, and in a seq2seq setup generate accompaniments conditioned on melodies.   We evaluate the Transformer with our relative attention mechanism on two datasets, JSB Chorales and Piano-e-competition, and obtain state-of-the-art results on the latter.	7	202	1	0	15	6.232673267326732
10	Recently popularized graph neural networks achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on a number of standard benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning, improving significantly over existing approaches. These architectures alternate between a propagation layer that aggregates the hidden states of the local neighborhood and a fully-connected layer. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that a linear model, that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, is still able to achieve a performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models. This significantly reduces the number of parameters, which is critical for semi-supervised learning where number of labeled examples are small. This in turn allows a room for designing more innovative propagation layers. Based on this insight, we propose a novel graph neural network that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, and replaces the propagation layers with attention mechanisms that respect the structure of the graph. The attention mechanism allows us to learn a dynamic and adaptive local summary of the neighborhood to achieve more accurate predictions. In a number of experiments on benchmark citation networks datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing methods. By examining the attention weights among neighbors, we show that our model provides some interesting insights on how neighbors influence each other.	7	198	3	0	22	6.161616161616162
10	Federated learning has a variety of applications in multiple domains by utilizing private training data stored on different devices. However, the aggregation process in federated learning is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks so that the global model may behave abnormally under attacks. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel aggregation algorithm with residual-based reweighting to defend federated learning. Our aggregation algorithm combines repeated median regression with the reweighting scheme in iteratively reweighted least squares. Our experiments show that our aggression algorithm outperforms other alternative algorithms in the presence of label-flipping, backdoor, and Gaussian noise attacks. We also provide theoretical guarantees for our aggregation algorithm.	6	105	2	0	13	6.514285714285713

10	We propose a novel approach to compute a stable and generalizing metric (LNSM) with convolutional neural networks (CNN) to compare field data from a variety of numerical simulation sources. Our method employs a Siamese network architecture that is motivated by the mathematical properties of a metric and is known to work well for finding similarities of other data modalities. We leverage a controllable data generation setup with partial differential equation (PDE) solvers to create increasingly different outputs from a reference simulation. In addition, the data generation allows for adjusting the difficulty of the resulting learning task. A central component of our learned metric is a specialized loss function, that introduces knowledge about the correlation between single data samples into the training process. To demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing simple metrics for vector spaces and other learned, image based metrics we evaluate the different methods on a large range of test data. Additionally, we analyze generalization benefits of using the proposed correlation loss and the impact of an adjustable training data difficulty.	6	173	6	0	15	5.7630057803468215
10	Understanding the implicit bias of optimization algorithms is important in order to improve generalization of neural networks. One approach to try to exploit such understanding would be to then make the bias explicit in the loss function.  Conversely, an interesting approach to gain more insights into the implicit bias could be to study how different loss functions  are being implicitly minimized when training the network. In this work, we concentrate our study on the inductive bias occurring when minimizing the cross-entropy loss with different batch sizes and learning rates.  We investigate how three loss functions are being implicitly minimized during training. These three loss functions are the Hinge loss with different margins, the cross-entropy loss with different temperatures and a newly introduced Gcdf loss with different standard deviations. This  Gcdf loss establishes a connection between a sharpness measure for the 0−1 loss and margin based loss functions. We find that a common behavior is emerging for all the loss functions considered.	12	161	4	0	17	5.583850931677018
01	Despite the growing interest in continual learning, most of its contemporary works have been studied in a rather restricted setting where tasks are clearly distinguishable, and task boundaries are known during training. However, if our goal is to develop an algorithm that learns as humans do, this setting is far from realistic, and it is essential to develop a methodology that works in a task-free manner. Meanwhile, among several branches of continual learning, expansion-based methods have the advantage of eliminating catastrophic forgetting by allocating new resources to learn new data. In this work, we propose an expansion-based approach for task-free continual learning. Our model, named Continual Neural Dirichlet Process Mixture (CN-DPM), consists of a set of neural network experts that are in charge of a subset of the data. CN-DPM expands the number of experts in a principled way under the Bayesian nonparametric framework. With extensive experiments, we show that our model successfully performs task-free continual learning for both discriminative and generative tasks such as image classification and image generation.	10	170	3	1	34	5.7
10	The goal of imitation learning (IL) is to enable a learner to imitate an expert’s behavior given the expert’s demonstrations. Recently, generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) has successfully achieved it even on complex continuous control tasks. However, GAIL requires a huge number of interactions with environment during training. We believe that IL algorithm could be more applicable to the real-world environments if the number of interactions could be reduced. To this end, we propose a model free, off-policy IL algorithm for continuous control. The keys of our algorithm are two folds: 1) adopting deterministic policy that allows us to derive a novel type of policy gradient which we call deterministic policy imitation gradient (DPIG), 2) introducing a function which we call state screening function (SSF) to avoid noisy policy updates with states that are not typical of those appeared on the expert’s demonstrations. Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve the goal of IL with at least tens of times less interactions than GAIL on a variety of continuous control tasks.	5	172	1	0	27	5.447674418604653
01	A growing number of learning methods are actually differentiable games whose players optimise multiple, interdependent objectives in parallel – from GANs and intrinsic curiosity to multi-agent RL. Opponent shaping is a powerful approach to improve learning dynamics in these games, accounting for player influence on others’ updates. Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA) is a recent algorithm that exploits this response and leads to cooperation in settings like the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. Although experimentally successful, we show that LOLA agents can exhibit ‘arrogant’ behaviour directly at odds with convergence. In fact, remarkably few algorithms have theoretical guarantees applying across all (n-player, non-convex) games. In this paper we present Stable Opponent Shaping (SOS), a new method that interpolates between LOLA and a stable variant named LookAhead. We prove that LookAhead converges locally to equilibria and avoids strict saddles in all differentiable games. SOS inherits these essential guarantees, while also shaping the learning of opponents and consistently either matching or outperforming LOLA experimentally.	6	160	5	0	25	6.225

We use extractive summarizationto coarsely identify salient information and a neural abstractive model to generatethe article. For the abstractive model, we introduce a decoder-only architecturethat can scalably attend to very long sequences, much longer than typical encoder-decoder architectures used in sequence transduction. We show that this model cangenerate fluent, coherent multi-sentence paragraphs and even whole Wikipediaarticles. When given reference documents, we show it can extract relevant factualinformation as reflected in perplexity, ROUGE scores and human evaluations.	6	101	7	0	10	6.138613861386138
10	We uncover a connection between two seemingly unrelated empirical phenomena: mode connectivity and sparsity. On the one hand, there is growing catalog of situations where, across multiple runs, SGD learns weights that fall into minima that are connected (mode connectivity). A striking example is described by Nagarajan & Kolter (2019). They observe that test error on MNIST does not change along the linear path connecting the end points of two independent SGD runs, starting from the same random initialization. On the other hand, there is the lottery ticket hypothesis of Frankle & Carbin (2019), where dense, randomly initialized networks have sparse subnetworks capable of training in isolation to full accuracy.However, neither phenomenon scales beyond small vision networks. We start by proposing a technique to find sparse subnetworks after initialization. We observe that these subnetworks match the accuracy of the full network only when two SGD runs for the same subnetwork are connected by linear paths with the no change in test error. Our findings connect the existence of sparse subnetworks that train to high accuracy with the dynamics of optimization via mode connectivity. In doing so, we identify analogues of the phenomena uncovered by Nagarajan & Kolter and Frankle & Carbin in ImageNet-scale architectures at state-of-the-art sparsity levels.	6	209	4	0	31	5.535885167464116
10	An unintended consequence of feature sharing is the model fitting to correlated tasks within the dataset, termed negative transfer.  In this paper, we revisit the problem of negative transfer in multitask setting and find that its corrosive effects are applicable to a wide range of linear and non-linear models, including neural networks. We first study the effects of negative transfer in a principled way and show that previously proposed counter-measures are insufficient, particularly for trainable features. We propose an adversarial training approach to mitigate the effects of negative transfer by viewing the problem in a domain adaptation setting. Finally, empirical results on attribute prediction multi-task on AWA and CUB datasets further validate the need for correcting negative sharing in an end-to-end manner.	6	122	2	0	18	5.770491803278687
10	Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be a powerful paradigm for deriving complex behaviors from simple reward signals in a wide range of environments. When applying RL to continuous control agents in simulated physics environments, the body is usually considered to be part of the environment. However, during evolution the physical body of biological organisms and their controlling brains are co-evolved, thus exploring a much larger space of actuator/controller configurations. Put differently, the intelligence does not reside only in the agent's mind, but also in the design of their body. We propose a method for uncovering strong agents, consisting of a good combination of a body and policy, based on combining RL with an evolutionary procedure. Given the resulting agent, we also propose an approach for identifying the body changes that contributed the most to the agent performance. We use the Shapley value from cooperative game theory to find the fair contribution of individual components, taking into account synergies between components. We evaluate our methods in an environment similar to the the recently proposed Robo-Sumo task, where agents in a 3D environment with simulated physics compete in tipping over their opponent or pushing them out of the arena. Our results show that the proposed methods are indeed capable of generating strong agents, significantly outperforming baselines that focus on optimizing the agent policy alone.

10	A large fraction of computational science involves simulating the dynamics of particles that interact via pairwise or many-body interactions. These simulations, called Molecular Dynamics (MD), span a vast range of subjects from physics and materials science to biochemistry and drug discovery. Most MD software involves significant use of handwritten derivatives and code reuse across C++, FORTRAN, and CUDA. This is reminiscent of the state of machine learning before automatic differentiation became popular. In this work we bring the substantial advances in software that have taken place in machine learning to MD with JAX, M.D. (JAX MD). JAX MD is an end-to-end differentiable MD package written entirely in Python that can be just-in-time compiled to CPU, GPU, or TPU. JAX MD allows researchers to iterate extremely quickly and lets researchers easily incorporate machine learning models into their workflows. Finally, since all of the simulation code is written in Python, researchers can have unprecedented flexibility in setting up experiments without having to edit any low-level C++ or CUDA code. In addition to making existing workloads easier, JAX MD allows researchers to take derivatives through whole-simulations as well as seamlessly incorporate neural networks into simulations. This paper explores the architecture of JAX MD and its capabilities through several vignettes. Code is available at github.com/jaxmd/jax-md along with an interactive Colab notebook.	11	217	4	1	17	5.815668202764977
10	The sophisticated structure of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) allows foroutstanding performance, but at the cost of intensive computation. As significantredundancies inevitably present in such a structure, many works have been proposedto prune the convolutional filters for computation cost reduction. Althoughextremely effective, most works are based only on quantitative characteristics ofthe convolutional filters, and highly overlook the qualitative interpretation of individualfilter’s specific functionality. In this work, we interpreted the functionalityand redundancy of the convolutional filters from different perspectives, and proposeda functionality-oriented filter pruning method. With extensive experimentresults, we proved the convolutional filters’ qualitative significance regardless ofmagnitude, demonstrated significant neural network redundancy due to repetitivefilter functions, and analyzed the filter functionality defection under inappropriateretraining process. Such an interpretable pruning approach not only offers outstandingcomputation cost optimization over previous filter pruning methods, butalso interprets filter pruning process.	4	148	0	0	0	6.986486486486488
10	First-order methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are currently the standard algorithm for training deep neural networks. Second-order methods, despite their better convergence rate, are rarely used in practice due to the pro- hibitive computational cost in calculating the second-order information. In this paper, we propose a novel Gram-Gauss-Newton (GGN) algorithm to train deep neural networks for regression problems with square loss. Our method draws inspiration from the connection between neural network optimization and kernel regression of neural tangent kernel (NTK). Different from typical second-order methods that have heavy computational cost in each iteration, GGN only has minor overhead compared to first-order methods such as SGD. We also give theoretical results to show that for sufficiently wide neural networks, the convergence rate of GGN is quadratic. Furthermore, we provide convergence guarantee for mini-batch GGN algorithm, which is, to our knowledge, the first convergence result for the mini-batch version of a second-order method on overparameterized neural net- works. Preliminary experiments on regression tasks demonstrate that for training standard networks, our GGN algorithm converges much faster and achieves better performance than SGD.	9	181	4	0	24	6.121546961325968
01	Learning in environments with large state and action spaces, and sparse rewards, can hinder a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent’s learning through trial-and-error. For instance, following natural language instructions on the Web (such as booking a flight ticket) leads to RL settings where input vocabulary and number of actionable elements on a page can grow very large. Even though recent approaches improve the success rate on relatively simple environments with the help of human demonstrations to guide the exploration, they still fail in environments where the set of possible instructions can reach millions. We approach the aforementioned problems from a different perspective and propose guided RL approaches that can generate unbounded amount of experience for an agent to learn from. Instead of learning from a complicated instruction with a large vocabulary, we decompose it into multiple sub-instructions and schedule a curriculum in which an agent is tasked with a gradually increasing subset of these relatively easier sub-instructions. In addition, when the expert demonstrations are not available, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that generates new instruction following tasks and trains the agent more effectively. We train DQN, deep reinforcement learning agent, with Q-value function approximated with a novel QWeb neural network architecture on these smaller, synthetic instructions. We evaluate the ability of our agent to generalize to new instructions onWorld of Bits benchmark, on forms with up to 100 elements, supporting 14 million possible instructions. The QWeb agent outperforms the baseline without using any human demonstration achieving 100% success rate on several difficult environments.	5	253	5	0	17	5.853754940711463
01	We present a new neural text to speech (TTS) method that is able to transform text to speech in voices that are sampled in the wild. Unlike other systems, our solution is able to deal with unconstrained voice samples and without requiring aligned phonemes or linguistic features. The network architecture is simpler than those in the existing literature and is based on a novel shifting buffer working memory. The same buffer is used for estimating the attention, computing the output audio, and for updating the buffer itself. The input sentence is encoded using a context-free lookup table that contains one entry per character or phoneme. The speakers are similarly represented by a short vector that can also be fitted to new identities, even with only a few samples. Variability in the generated speech is achieved by priming the buffer prior to generating the audio. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate convincing capabilities, making TTS accessible to a wider range of applications. In order to promote reproducibility, we release our source code and models.	9	173	4	0	0	5.2601156069364166
01	Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is a hard problem due to degeneracies in the optimization landscape, a problem also known as vanishing/exploding gradients. Short of designing new RNN architectures, previous methods for dealing with this problem usually boil down to orthogonalization of the recurrent dynamics, either at initialization or during the entire training period. The basic motivation behind these methods is that orthogonal transformations are isometries of the Euclidean space, hence they preserve (Euclidean) norms and effectively deal with vanishing/exploding gradients. However, this ignores the crucial effects of non-linearity and noise. In the presence of a non-linearity, orthogonal transformations no longer preserve norms, suggesting that alternative transformations might be better suited to non-linear networks. Moreover, in the presence of noise, norm preservation itself ceases to be the ideal objective. A more sensible objective is maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the propagated signal instead. Previous work has shown that in the linear case, recurrent networks that maximize the SNR display strongly non-normal, sequential dynamics and orthogonal networks are highly suboptimal by this measure. Motivated by this finding, here we investigate the potential of non-normal RNNs, i.e. RNNs with a non-normal recurrent connectivity matrix, in sequential processing tasks. Our experimental results show that non-normal RNNs outperform their orthogonal counterparts in a diverse range of benchmarks. We also find evidence for increased non-normality and hidden chain-like feedforward motifs in trained RNNs initialized with orthogonal recurrent connectivity matrices. 	10	235	3	1	17	6.293617021276598
10	"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning is a popular method to exploit temporal abstractions in order to tackle the curse of dimensionality. The options framework is one such hierarchical framework that models the notion of skills or options. However, learning a collection of task-agnostic transferable skills is a challenging task. Option discovery typically entails using heuristics, the majority of which revolve around discovering bottleneck states. In this work, we adopt a method complementary to the idea of discovering bottlenecks. Instead, we attempt to discover ``landmark"" sub-goals which are prototypical states of well connected regions. These sub-goals are points from which densely connected set of states are easily accessible. We propose a new model called Successor options that leverages Successor Representations to achieve the same. We also design a novel pseudo-reward for learning the intra-option policies. Additionally, we describe an Incremental Successor options model that iteratively builds options and explores in environments where exploration through primitive actions is inadequate to form the Successor Representations. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a collection of grid worlds and on complex high dimensional environments like Deepmind-Lab."	10	182	1	0	11	6.137362637362638
10	Large-scale publicly available datasets play a fundamental role in training deep learning models. However, large-scaledatasets are difficult to collect in problems that involve processing of sensitive information.Collaborative learning techniques provide a privacy-preserving solution in such cases, by enablingtraining over a number of private datasets that are not shared by their owners.Existing collaborative learningtechniques, combined with differential privacy, are shown to be resilient against a passiveadversary which tries to infer the training data only from the model parameters. However, recently, it hasbeen shown that the existing collaborative learning techniques are vulnerable to an active adversary that runs a GANattack during the learning phase. In this work, we propose a novel key-based collaborative learning technique that isresilient against such GAN attacks. For this purpose, we present a collaborative learning formulation in which class scores are protected by class-specific keys, and therefore, prevents a GAN attack. We also show thatvery high dimensional class-specific keys can be utilized to improve robustness against attacks, without increasing the model complexity. Our experimental results on two popular datasets, MNIST and AT&T Olivetti Faces, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniqueagainst the GAN attack. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first collaborative learningformulation that effectively tackles an active adversary, and, unlike model corruption or differential privacy formulations,our approach does not inherently feature a trade-off between model accuracy and data privacy.	9	240	3	0	0	6.016666666666668
10	We propose a method to learn stochastic activation functions for use in probabilistic neural networks.First, we develop a framework to embed stochastic activation functions based on Gaussian processes in probabilistic neural networks.Second, we analytically derive expressions for the propagation of means and covariances in such a network, thus allowing for an efficient implementation and training without the need for sampling.Third, we show how to apply variational Bayesian inference to regularize and efficiently train this model.The resulting model can deal with uncertain inputs and implicitly provides an estimate of the confidence of its predictions.Like a conventional neural network it can scale to datasets of arbitrary size and be extended with convolutional and recurrent connections, if desired.	3	120	1	0	21	5.808333333333334
01	In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model, called E2Efold, for RNA secondary structure prediction which can effectively take into account the inherent constraints in the problem. The key idea of E2Efold is to directly predict the RNA base-pairing matrix, and use an unrolled algorithm for constrained programming as the template for deep architectures to enforce constraints. With comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of E2Efold: it predicts significantly better structures compared to previous SOTA (especially for pseudoknotted structures), while being as efficient as the fastest algorithms in terms of inference time.	8	98	4	1	19	6.061224489795919
10	The contributions of this paper are two-fold. We define a new filtration called the cover filtration built from a single cover based on a generalized Steinhaus distance, which is a generalization of Jaccard distance. We then develop a language and theory for stable paths within this filtration, inspired by ideas of persistent homology. This framework can be used to develop several new learning representations in applications where an obvious metric may not be defined but a cover is readily available. We demonstrate the utility of our framework as applied to recommendation systems and explainable machine learning.We demonstrate a new perspective for modeling recommendation system data sets that does not require manufacturing a bespoke metric. As a direct application, we find that the stable paths identified by our framework in a movies data set represent a sequence of movies constituting a gentle transition and ordering from one genre to another.For explainable machine learning, we apply the Mapper for model induction, providing explanations in the form of paths between subpopulations. Our framework provides an alternative way of building a filtration from a single mapper that is then used to explore stable paths. As a direct illustration, we build a mapper from a supervised machine learning model trained on the FashionMNIST data set. We show that the stable paths in the cover filtration provide improved explanations of relationships between subpopulations of images.	8	231	6	0	16	5.463203463203462
10	We identify a phenomenon, which we refer to as *multi-model forgetting*, that occurs when sequentially training multiple deep networks with partially-shared parameters; the performance of previously-trained models degrades as one optimizes a subsequent one, due to the overwriting of shared parameters. To overcome this, we introduce a statistically-justified weight plasticity loss that regularizes the learning of a model's shared parameters according to their importance for the previous models, and demonstrate its effectiveness when training two models sequentially and for neural architecture search. Adding weight plasticity in neural architecture search preserves the best models to the end of the search and yields improved results in both natural language processing and computer vision tasks.	3	112	5	0	16	6.178571428571429
10	In many learning situations, resources at inference time are significantly more constrained than resources at training time. This paper studies a general paradigm, called Differentiable ARchitecture Compression (DARC), that combines model compression and architecture search to learn models that are resource-efficient at inference time. Given a resource-intensive base architecture, DARC utilizes the training data to learn which sub-components can be replaced by cheaper alternatives. The high-level technique can be applied to any neural architecture, and we report experiments on state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for image classification. For a WideResNet with 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10, we improve single-sample inference speed by 2.28X and memory footprint by 5.64X, with no accuracy loss. For a ResNet with 79.15% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, we improve batch inference speed by 1.29X and memory footprint by 3.57X with 1% accuracy loss. We also give theoretical Rademacher complexity bounds in simplified cases, showing how DARC avoids over-fitting despite over-parameterization.	3	152	0	0	0	6.25
10	Despite their success, generative adversarial networks (GANs) cannot easily generate structured objects like molecules or game maps. The issue is that such objects must satisfy structural requirements (e.g., molecules must be chemically valid, game maps must guarantee reachability of the end goal) that are difficult to capture with examples alone.  As a remedy, we     propose constrained adversarial networks (CANs), which embed the constraints into the model during training by penalizing the generator whenever it outputs invalid structures. As in unconstrained GANs, new objects can be sampled straightforwardly from the generator, but in addition they satisfy the constraints with high probability.  Our approach handles arbitrary logical constraints and leverages knowledge compilation techniques to efficiently evaluate the expected disagreement between the     model and the constraints.  This setup is further extended to hybrid logical-neural constraints for capturing complex requirements like graph reachability.  An extensive empirical analysis on constrained images, molecules, and video game levels shows that CANs efficiently generate valid structures that are both high-quality and novel.	9	164	3	0	15	6.2926829268292686
01	Localizing a specific protein in a human cell is essential for understanding cellular functions and biological processes of underlying diseases. A promising, low-cost,and time-efficient biotechnology for localizing proteins is high-throughput fluorescence microscopy imaging (HTI). This imaging technique stains the protein of interest in a cell with fluorescent antibodies and subsequently takes a microscopic image.  Together with images of other stained proteins or cell organelles and the annotation by the Human Protein Atlas project, these images provide a rich source of information on the protein location which can be utilized by computational methods.  It is yet unclear how precise such methods are and whether they can compete with human experts.   We here focus on deep learning image analysis methods and, in particular, on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)since they showed overwhelming success across different imaging tasks. We pro-pose a novel CNN architecture “GapNet-PL” that has been designed to tackle the characteristics of HTI data and uses global averages of filters at different abstraction levels.   We present the largest comparison of CNN architectures including GapNet-PL for protein localization in HTI images of human cells.  GapNet-PL outperforms all other competing methods and reaches close to perfect localization in all 13 tasks with an average AUC of 98% and F1 score of 78%.  On a separate test set the performance of GapNet-PL was compared with three human experts and 25 scholars. GapNet-PL achieved an accuracy of 91%, significantly (p-value 1.1e−6) outperforming the best human expert with an accuracy of 72%.	7	245	5	0	0	5.726530612244897
10	Pooling operations have shown to be effective on various tasks in computer vision and natural language processing. One challenge of performing pooling operations on graph data is the lack of locality that is not well-defined on graphs. Previous studies used global ranking methods to sample some of the important nodes, but most of them are not able to incorporate graph topology information in computing ranking scores. In this work, we propose the topology-aware pooling (TAP) layer that uses attention operators to generate ranking scores for each node by attending each node to its neighboring nodes. The ranking scores are generated locally while the selection is performed globally, which enables the pooling operation to consider topology information. To encourage better graph connectivity in the sampled graph, we propose to add a graph connectivity term to the computation of ranking scores in the TAP layer. Based on our TAP layer, we develop a network on graph data, known as the topology-aware pooling network. Experimental results on graph classification tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve consistently better performance than previous models.	5	178	0	0	0	5.550561797752808
10	Network quantization is a model compression and acceleration technique that has become essential to neural network deployment. Most quantization methods per- form fine-tuning on a pretrained network, but this sometimes results in a large loss in accuracy compared to the original network. We introduce a new technique to train quantization-friendly networks, which can be directly converted to an accurate quantized network without the need for additional fine-tuning. Our technique allows quantizing the weights and activations of all network layers down to 4 bits, achieving high efficiency and facilitating deployment in practical settings. Com- pared to other fully quantized networks operating at 4 bits, we show substantial improvements in accuracy, for example 66.68% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet using ResNet-18, compared to the previous state-of-the-art accuracy of 61.52% Louizos et al. (2019) and a full precision reference accuracy of 69.76%. We performed a thorough set of experiments to test the efficacy of our method and also conducted ablation studies on different aspects of the method and techniques to improve training stability and accuracy. Our codebase and trained models are available on GitHub.	5	180	2	1	26	5.766666666666668
10	We address the problem of reconstructing a matrix from a subset of its entries. Current methods, branded as geometric matrix completion, augment classical rank regularization techniques by incorporating geometric information into the solution. This information is usually provided as graphs encoding relations between rows/columns.In this work we propose a simple spectral approach for solving the matrix completion problem, via the framework of functional maps. We introduce the zoomout loss, a multiresolution spectral geometric loss inspired by recent advances in shape correspondence, whose minimization leads to state-of-the-art results on various recommender systems datasets. Surprisingly, for some datasets we were able to achieve comparable results even without incorporating geometric information. This puts into question both the quality of such information and current methods' ability to use it in a meaningful and efficient way.	9	132	4	1	15	6.151515151515151
10	We introduce a neural network that represents sentences by composing their words according to induced binary parse trees. We use Tree-LSTM as our composition function, applied along a tree structure found by a fully differentiable natural language chart parser. Our model simultaneously optimises both the composition function and the parser, thus eliminating the need for externally-provided parse trees which are normally required for Tree-LSTM. It can therefore be seen as a tree-based RNN that is unsupervised with respect to the parse trees. As it is fully differentiable, our model is easily trained with an off-the-shelf gradient descent method and backpropagation. We demonstrate that it achieves better performance compared to various supervised Tree-LSTM architectures on a textual entailment task and a reverse dictionary task. Finally, we show how performance can be improved with an attention mechanism which fully exploits the parse chart, by attending over all possible subspans of the sentence.	9	150	5	0	13	5.74
01	The goal of program synthesis is to automatically generate programs in a particular language from corresponding specifications, e.g. input-output behavior.Many current approaches achieve impressive results after training on randomly generated I/O examples in limited domain-specific languages (DSLs), as with string transformations in RobustFill.However, we empirically discover that applying test input generation techniques for languages with control flow and rich input space causes deep networks to generalize poorly to certain data distributions;to correct this, we propose a new methodology for controlling and evaluating the bias of synthetic data distributions over both programs and specifications.We demonstrate, using the Karel DSL and a small Calculator DSL, that training deep networks on these distributions leads to improved cross-distribution generalization performance. 	6	120	0	0	0	6.425
10	One of the main challenges of deep learning methods is the choice of an appropriate training strategy. In particular, additional steps, such as unsupervised pre-training, have been shown to greatly improve the performances of deep structures. In this article, we propose an extra training step, called post-training, which only optimizes the last layer of the network. We show that this procedure can be analyzed in the context of kernel theory, with the first layers computing an embedding of the data and the last layer a statistical model to solve the task based on this embedding. This step makes sure that the embedding, or representation, of the data is used in the best possible way for the considered task. This idea is then tested on multiple architectures with various data sets, showing that it consistently provides a boost in performance.	4	139	0	0	19	5.129496402877698
10	Deep convolutional  neural networks are known to specialize in distilling compact and robust prior from a large amount of data. We are interested in applying deep networks in the absence of training dataset. In this paper, we introduce deep audio prior (DAP)  which leverages the structure of a network and the temporal information in a single audio file. Specifically, we demonstrate that a randomly-initialized neural network can be used with carefully designed audio prior to tackle challenging audio problems such as universal blind source separation, interactive audio editing, audio texture synthesis, and audio co-separation.To understand the robustness of the deep audio prior, we construct a benchmark dataset Universal-150 for universal sound source separation with a diverse set of sources. We show superior audio results than previous work on both qualitatively and quantitative evaluations. We also perform thorough ablation study to validate our design choices.	3	145	4	1	12	5.724137931034483
10	State-of-the-art quantization methods can compress deep neural networks down to 4 bits without losing accuracy. However, when it comes to 2 bits, the performance drop is still noticeable. One problem in these methods is that they assign equal bit rate to quantize weights and activations in all layers, which is not reasonable in the case of high rate compression (such as 2-bit quantization), as some of layers in deep neural networks are sensitive to quantization and performing coarse quantization on these layers can hurt the accuracy. In this paper, we address an important problem of how to optimize the bit allocation of weights and activations for deep CNNs compression. We first explore the additivity of output error caused by quantization and find that additivity property holds for deep neural networks which are continuously differentiable in the layers. Based on this observation, we formulate the optimal bit allocation problem of weights and activations in a joint framework and propose a very efficient method to solve the optimization problem via Lagrangian Formulation. Our method obtains excellent results on deep neural networks. It can compress deep CNN ResNet-50 down to 2 bits with only 0.7% accuracy loss. To the best our knowledge, this is the first paper that reports 2-bit results on deep CNNs without hurting the accuracy.	11	215	0	1	0	5.2883720930232565
10	Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) has been a default module in  modern deep networks  due to its effectiveness for accelerating training deep neural networks.  It is widely accepted that the great success of BatchNorm is owing to reduction of internal covariate shift (ICS), but recently it is demonstrated that the link between them is fairly weak. The intrinsic reason behind effectiveness of BatchNorm is still unrevealed that limits it to be made better use. In light of this,  we propose a new normalization approach,  referred to as Pre-Operation Normalization (POP-Norm), which is theoretically ensured to speed up the training convergence. Not surprisingly, POP-Norm and BatchNorm are largely the same. Hence the similarities  can help us to theoretically interpret the root of BatchNorm's effectiveness. There are still some significant distinctions between the two approaches. Just the distinctions make POP-Norm achieve faster convergence rate and better performance than BatchNorm, which are validated in extensive experiments on benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2012.	9	158	3	0	0	5.886075949367089
10	This paper proposes a new model for the rating prediction task in recommender systems which significantly outperforms previous state-of-the art models on a time-split Netflix data set. Our model is based on deep autoencoder with 6 layers and is trained end-to-end without any layer-wise pre-training. We empirically demonstrate that: a) deep autoencoder models generalize much better than the shallow ones, b) non-linear activation functions with negative parts are crucial for training deep models, and c) heavy use of regularization techniques such as dropout is necessary to prevent over-fitting. We also propose a new training algorithm based on iterative output re-feeding to overcome natural sparseness of collaborate filtering. The new algorithm significantly speeds up training and improves model performance. Our code is publicly available.	6	123	4	0	18	5.9105691056910565
10	The machine learning and computer vision community is witnessing an unprecedented rate of new tasks being proposed and addressed, thanks to the power of deep convolutional networks to find complex mappings from X to Y. The advent of each task often accompanies the release of a large-scale human-labeled dataset, for supervised training of the deep network. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to manually label sufficient amount of training data. Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that can leverage off-the-shelf labeled dataset to learn useful knowledge for the target task. While previous works mostly focus on transfer learning from a single source, we study multi-source transfer across domains and tasks (MS-DTT), in a semi-supervised setting. We propose GradMix, a model-agnostic method applicable to any model trained with gradient-based learning rule. GradMix transfers knowledge via gradient descent, by weighting and mixing the gradients from all sources during training. Our method follows a meta-learning objective, by assigning layer-wise weights to the source gradients, such that the combined gradient follows the direction that can minimize the loss for a small set of samples from the target dataset. In addition, we propose to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each mini-batch based on its importance to the target task, and a pseudo-labeling method to leverage the unlabeled samples in the target domain. We perform experiments on two MS-DTT tasks: digit recognition and action recognition, and demonstrate the advantageous performance of the proposed method against multiple baselines.	7	243	3	0	16	5.732510288065844
10	Time is an important feature in many applications involving events that occur synchronously and/or asynchronously. To effectively consume time information, recent studies have focused on designing new architectures. In this paper, we take an orthogonal but complementary approach by providing a model-agnostic vector representation for time, called Time2Vec, that can be easily imported into many existing and future architectures and improve their performances. We show on a range of models and problems that replacing the notion of time with its Time2Vec representation improves the performance of the final model.	7	89	0	0	0	5.9325842696629225
10	Convolution neural networks typically consist of many convolutional layers followed by several fully-connected layers.  While convolutional layers map between high-order activation tensors, the fully-connected layers operate on flattened activation vectors.  Despite its success, this approach has notable drawbacks. Flattening discards the multi-dimensional structure of the activations, and the fully-connected layers require a large number of parameters. We present two new techniques to address these problems.  First, we introduce tensor contraction layers which can replace the ordinary fully-connected layers in a neural network. Second, we introduce tensor regression layers, which express the output of a neural network as a low-rank multi-linear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to the softmax layer.  Both the contraction and regression weights are learned end-to-end by backpropagation. By imposing low rank on both, we use significantly fewer parameters.  Experiments on the ImageNet dataset show that applied to the popular VGG and ResNet architectures, our methods significantly reduce the number of parameters in the fully connected layers (about 65% space savings) while negligibly impacting accuracy.	5	168	4	0	31	6.291666666666668
10	Unsupervised knowledge transfer has a great potential to improve the generalizability of deep models to novel domains. Yet the current literature assumes that the label distribution is domain-invariant and only aligns the covariate or vice versa. In this paper, we explore the task of Generalized Domain Adaptation (GDA): How to transfer knowledge across different domains in the presence of both covariate and label shift? We propose a covariate and label distribution CO-ALignment (COAL) model to tackle this problem. Our model leverages prototype-based conditional alignment and label distribution estimation to diminish the covariate and label shifts, respectively. We demonstrate experimentally that when both types of shift exist in the data, COAL leads to state-of-the-art performance on several cross-domain benchmarks.	9	118	3	0	22	6.016949152542372
10	Learning latent representations of nodes in graphs is an important and ubiquitous task with widespread applications such as link prediction, node classification, and graph visualization. Previous methods on graph representation learning mainly focus on static graphs, however, many real-world graphs are dynamic and evolve over time. In this paper, we present Dynamic Self-Attention Network (DySAT), a novel neural architecture that operates on dynamic graphs and learns node representations that capture both structural properties and temporal evolutionary patterns. Specifically, DySAT computes node representations by jointly employing self-attention layers along two dimensions: structural neighborhood and temporal dynamics. We conduct link prediction experiments on two classes of graphs: communication networks and bipartite rating networks. Our experimental results show that DySAT has a significant performance gain over several different state-of-the-art graph embedding baselines.	7	129	5	0	31	6.689922480620155
01	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly thought to recognise objects by learning increasingly complex representations of object shapes. Some recent studies suggest a more important role of image textures. We here put these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based representation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation instead when trained on 'Stylized-ImageNet', a stylized version of ImageNet. This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our well-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560 psychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of unexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and previously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions, highlighting advantages of a shape-based representation.	13	171	7	0	32	6.380116959064328
10	Despite a lot of theoretical efforts, very little is known about mechanisms of implicit regularization by which the low complexity contributes to generalization in deep learning. In particular, causality between the generalization performance, implicit regularization and nonlinearity of activation functions is one of the basic mysteries of deep neural networks (DNNs). In this work, we introduce a novel technique for DNNs called random walk analysis and reveal a mechanism of the implicit regularization caused by nonlinearity of ReLU activation. Surprisingly, our theoretical results suggest that the learned DNNs interpolate almost linearly between data points, which leads to the low complexity solutions in the over-parameterized regime. As a result, we prove that stochastic gradient descent can learn a class of continuously differentiable functions with generalization bounds of the order of $O(n^{-2})$ ($n$: the number of samples). Furthermore, our analysis is independent of the kernel methods, including neural tangent kernels.	8	148	4	0	0	6.04054054054054
10	Representation learning in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms focuses on extracting useful features for choosing good actions. Expressive representations are essential for learning well-performed policies. In this paper, we study the relationship between the state representation assigned by the state extractor and the performance of the RL agent. We observe that representations assigned by the better state extractor are more scattered than which assigned by the worse one. Moreover, RL agents achieving high performances always have high rank matrices which are composed by their representations. Based on our observations, we formally define expressiveness of the state extractor as the rank of the matrix composed by representations. Therefore, we propose to promote expressiveness so as to improve algorithm performances, and we call it Expressiveness Promoted DRL. We apply our method on both policy gradient and value-based algorithms, and experimental results on 55 Atari games show the superiority of our proposed method.	5	149	0	0	0	5.959731543624161
10	Deep generative modeling using flows has gained popularity owing to the tractable exact log-likelihood estimation with efficient training and synthesis process. However, flow models suffer from the challenge of having high dimensional latent space, same in dimension as the input space. An effective solution to the above challenge as proposed by Dinh et al. (2016) is a multi-scale architecture, which is based on iterative early factorization of a part of the total dimensions at regular intervals. Prior works on generative flows involving a multi-scale architecture perform the dimension factorization based on a static masking. We propose a novel multi-scale architecture that performs data dependent factorization to decide which dimensions should pass through more flow layers. To facilitate the same, we introduce a heuristic based on the contribution of each dimension to the total log-likelihood which encodes the importance of the dimensions. Our proposed heuristic is readily obtained as part of the flow training process, enabling versatile implementation of our likelihood contribution based multi-scale architecture for generic flow models. We present such an implementation for the original flow introduced in Dinh et al. (2016), and demonstrate improvements in log-likelihood score and sampling quality on standard image benchmarks. We also conduct ablation studies to compare proposed method with other options for dimension factorization.	8	211	5	0	15	5.909952606635071
10	Long training times of deep neural networks are a bottleneck in machine learning research. The major impediment to fast training is the quadratic growth of both memory and compute requirements of dense and convolutional layers with respect to their information bandwidth. Recently, training `a priori' sparse networks has been proposed as a method for allowing layers to retain high information bandwidth, while keeping memory and compute low. However, the choice of which sparse topology should be used in these networks is unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical foundation for the choice of intra-layer topology. First, we derive a new sparse neural network initialization scheme that allows us to explore the space of very deep sparse networks. Next, we evaluate several topologies and show that seemingly similar topologies can often have a large difference in attainable accuracy. To explain these differences, we develop a data-free heuristic that can evaluate a topology independently from the dataset the network will be trained on. We then derive a set of requirements that make a good topology, and arrive at a single topology that satisfies all of them. 	10	185	4	0	22	5.345945945945947
01	Previous work showed empirically that large neural networks can be significantly reduced in size while preserving their accuracy. Model compression became a central research topic, as it is crucial for deployment of neural networks on devices with limited computational and memory resources. The majority of the compression methods are based on heuristics and offer no worst-case guarantees on the trade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error for an arbitrarily new sample.We propose the first efficient, data-independent neural pruning algorithm with a provable trade-off between its compression rate and the approximation error for any future test sample. Our method is based on the coreset framework, which finds a small weighted subset of points that provably approximates the original inputs. Specifically, we approximate the output of a layer of neurons by a coreset of neurons in the previous layer and discard the rest. We apply this framework in a layer-by-layer fashion from the top to the bottom. Unlike previous works, our coreset is data independent, meaning that it provably guarantees the accuracy of the function for any input $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$, including an adversarial one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on popular network architectures. In particular, our coresets yield 90% compression of the LeNet-300-100 architecture on MNIST while improving the accuracy.	5	213	3	1	27	5.671361502347418
10	Various machine learning tasks can benefit from access to external information of different modalities, such as text and images. Recent work has focused on learning architectures with large memories capable of storing this knowledge. We propose augmenting Transformer neural networks with KNN-based Information Fetching (KIF) modules. Each KIF module learns a read operation to access fixed external knowledge. We apply these modules to generative dialogue modeling, a challenging task where information must be flexibly retrieved and incorporated to maintain the topic and flow of conversation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by identifying relevant knowledge from Wikipedia, images, and human-written dialogue utterances, and show that leveraging this retrieved information improves model performance, measured by automatic and human evaluation.	6	119	4	0	12	6.277310924369748
10	Olfaction has been and still is an area which is challenging to the research community. Like other senses of the body, there has been a push to replicate the sense of smell to aid in identifying odorous compounds in the form of an electronic nose. At IBM, our team (Cogniscent) has designed a modular sensor board platform based on the artificial olfaction concept we called EVA (Electronic Volatile Analyzer). EVA is an IoT electronic nose device that aims to reproduce olfaction in living begins by integrating an array of partially specific and uniquely selective smell recognition sensors which are directly exposed to the target chemical analyte or the environment. We are exploring a new technique called temperature-controlled oscillation, which gives us virtual array of sensors to represent our signals/ fingerprint. In our study, we run experiments on identifying different types of beers using EVA. In order to successfully carry this classification task, the entire process starting from preparation of samples, having a consistent protocol of data collection in place all the way to providing the data to be analyzed and input to a machine learning model is very important. On this paper, we will discuss the process of sniffing volatile organic compounds from liquid beer samples and successfully classifying different brands of beers as a pilot test. We researched on different machine learning models in order to get the best classification accuracy for our Beer samples. The best classification accuracy is achieved by using a multi-level perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) model, classification of three different brands of beers after splitting one-week data to a training and testing set yielded an accuracy of 97.334. While using separate weeks of data for training and testing set the model yielded an accuracy of 67.812, this is because of drift playing a role in the overall classification process. Using Random forest, the classification accuracy achieved by the model is 0.923. And Decision Tree achieved 0.911. 	10	323	10	0	23	5.352941176470588
10	Robust Reinforcement Learning aims to find the optimal policy with some degree of robustness to environmental dynamics. Existing learning algorithms usually enable the robustness though disturbing the current state or simulated environmental parameters in a heuristic way, which lack quantified robustness to the system dynamics (i.e.  transition probability).  To overcome this issue, we leverage Wasserstein distance to measure the disturbance to the reference transition probability. With Wasserstein distance, we are able to connect transition probability disturbance to the state disturbance, and reduces an infinite-dimensional optimization problem to a finite-dimensional risk-aware problem. Through the derived risk-aware optimal Bellman equation,  we first show the existence of optimal robust policies,  provide  a  sensitivity  analysis  for  the  perturbations,  and  then  design  a novel robust learning algorithm—WassersteinRobustAdvantageActor-Critic algorithm (WRA2C). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified in theCart-Pole environment.	6	135	0	0	0	6.82962962962963
10	Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) is an effective model for continual learning, where each gradient update for the current task is formulated as a quadratic program problem with inequality constraints that alleviate catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks. However, practical use of GEM is impeded by several limitations: (1) the data examples stored in the episodic memory may not be representative of past tasks; (2)  the inequality constraints appear to be rather restrictive for competing or conflicting tasks; (3) the inequality constraints can only avoid catastrophic forgetting but can not assure positive backward transfer. To address these issues, in this paper we aim at improving the original GEM model via three handy techniques without extra computational cost. Experiments on MNIST Permutations and incremental CIFAR100 datasets demonstrate that our techniques enhance the performance of GEM remarkably. On CIFAR100 the average accuracy is improved from 66.48% to 68.76%, along with the backward (knowledge) transfer growing from 1.38% to 4.03%.	7	155	0	1	0	5.825806451612903
10	Neural networks are known to be sensitive to adversarial perturbations. To investigate this undesired behavior we consider the problem of computing the distance to the decision boundary (DtDB) from a given sample for a deep NN classifier. In this work we present an iterative procedure where in each step we solve a convex quadratic programming (QP) task. Solving the single initial QP already results in a lower bound on the DtDB and can be used as a robustness certificate of the classifier around a given sample. In contrast to currently known approaches our method also provides upper bounds used as a measure of quality for the certificate. We show that our approach provides better or competitive results in comparison with a wide range of existing techniques.	9	126	0	0	0	5.087301587301587
01	We propose in this paper a new approach to train the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) with a mixture of generators to overcome the mode collapsing problem. The main intuition is to employ multiple generators, instead of using a single one as in the original GAN. The idea is simple, yet proven to be extremely effective at covering diverse data modes, easily overcoming the mode collapsing problem and delivering state-of-the-art results. A minimax formulation was able to establish among a classifier, a discriminator, and a set of generators in a similar spirit with GAN. Generators create samples that are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data, whilst the discriminator determines whether samples are true data or generated by generators, and the classifier specifies which generator a sample comes from. The distinguishing feature is that internal samples are created from multiple generators, and then one of them will be randomly selected as final output similar to the mechanism of a probabilistic mixture model. We term our method Mixture Generative Adversarial Nets (MGAN). We develop theoretical analysis to prove that, at the equilibrium, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between the mixture of generators’ distributions and the empirical data distribution is minimal, whilst the JSD among generators’ distributions is maximal, hence effectively avoiding the mode collapsing problem. By utilizing parameter sharing, our proposed model adds minimal computational cost to the standard GAN, and thus can also efficiently scale to large-scale datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic 2D data and natural image databases (CIFAR-10, STL-10 and ImageNet) to demonstrate the superior performance of our MGAN in achieving state-of-the-art Inception scores over latest baselines, generating diverse and appealing recognizable objects at different resolutions, and specializing in capturing different types of objects by the generators.	8	292	10	0	19	5.794520547945205
01	This paper establishes rates of universal approximation for the shallow neural tangent kernel (NTK): network weights are only allowed microscopic changes from random initialization, which entails that activations are mostly unchanged, and the network is nearly equivalent to its linearization. Concretely, the paper has two main contributions: a generic scheme to approximate functions with the NTK by sampling from transport mappings between the initial weights and their desired values, and the construction of transport mappings via Fourier transforms. Regarding the first contribution, the proof scheme provides another perspective on how the NTK regime arises from rescaling: redundancy in the weights due to resampling allows individual weights to be scaled down. Regarding the second contribution, the most notable transport mapping asserts that roughly $1 / \delta^{10d}$ nodes are sufficient to approximate continuous functions, where $\delta$ depends on the continuity properties of the target function. By contrast, nearly the same proof yields a bound of $1 / \delta^{2d}$ for shallow ReLU networks; this gap suggests a tantalizing direction for future work, separating shallow ReLU networks and their linearization.	8	176	4	0	14	5.982954545454546
01	Masked language modeling (MLM) pre-training methods such as BERT corrupt the input by replacing some tokens with [MASK] and then train a model to reconstruct the original tokens. While they produce good results when transferred to downstream NLP tasks, they generally require large amounts of compute to be effective. As an alternative, we propose a more sample-efficient pre-training task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the input, our approach corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our approach substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size, data, and compute. The gains are particularly strong for small models; for example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark. Our approach also works well at scale, where it performs comparably to RoBERTa and XLNet while using less than 1/4 of their compute and outperforms them when using the same amount of compute.	9	246	2	1	17	5.3373983739837385
10	Motivated by the study of generalization in biological intelligence, we examine reinforcement learning (RL) in settings where there are information-theoretic constraints placed on the learner's ability to represent a behavioral policy. We first show that the problem of optimizing expected utility within capacity-limited learning agents maps naturally to the mathematical field of rate-distortion (RD) theory. Applying the RD framework to the RL setting, we develop a new online RL algorithm, Capacity-Limited Actor-Critic, that learns a policy that optimizes a tradeoff between utility maximization and information processing costs. Using this algorithm in a 2D gridworld environment, we demonstrate two novel empirical results. First, at high information rates (high channel capacity), the algorithm achieves faster learning and discovers better policies compared to the standard tabular actor-critic algorithm. Second, we demonstrate that agents with capacity-limited policy representations avoid 'overfitting' and exhibit superior transfer to modified environments, compared to policies learned by agents with unlimited information processing resources. Our work provides a principled framework for the development of computationally rational RL agents.	6	168	4	0	22	6.49404761904762
10	Weight-sharing plays a significant role in the success of many deep neural networks, by increasing memory efficiency and incorporating useful inductive priors about the problem into the network. But understanding how weight-sharing can be used effectively in general is a topic that has not been studied extensively. Chen et al. (2015) proposed HashedNets, which augments a multi-layer perceptron with a hash table, as a method for neural network compression. We generalize this method into a framework (ArbNets) that allows for efficient arbitrary weight-sharing, and use it to study the role of weight-sharing in neural networks. We show that common neural networks can be expressed as ArbNets with different hash functions. We also present two novel hash functions, the Dirichlet hash and the Neighborhood hash, and use them to demonstrate experimentally that balanced and deterministic weight-sharing helps with the performance of a neural network.	7	143	11	0	23	5.664335664335664
10	Estimating the predictive uncertainty of a Bayesian learning model is critical in various decision-making problems, e.g., reinforcement learning, detecting adversarial attack, self-driving car. As the model posterior is almost always intractable, most efforts were made on finding an accurate approximation the true posterior. Even though a decent estimation of the model posterior is obtained, another approximation is required to compute the predictive distribution over the desired output. A common accurate solution is to use Monte Carlo (MC) integration. However, it needs to maintain a large number of samples, evaluate the model repeatedly and average multiple model outputs. In many real-world cases, this is computationally prohibitive. In this work, assuming that the exact posterior or a decent approximation is obtained, we propose a generic framework to approximate the output probability distribution induced by model posterior with a parameterized model and in an amortized fashion. The aim is to approximate the true uncertainty of a specific Bayesian model, meanwhile alleviating the heavy workload of MC integration at testing time. The proposed method is universally applicable to Bayesian classification models that allow for posterior sampling. Theoretically, we show that the idea of amortization incurs no additional costs on approximation performance. Empirical results validate the strong practical performance of our approach.	12	207	0	1	0	6.019323671497585
01	To act and plan in complex environments, we posit that agents should have a mental simulator of the world with three characteristics: (a) it should build an abstract state representing the condition of the world; (b) it should form a belief which represents uncertainty on the world; (c) it should go beyond simple step-by-step simulation, and exhibit temporal abstraction. Motivated by the absence of a model satisfying all these requirements, we propose TD-VAE, a generative sequence model that learns representations containing explicit beliefs about states several steps into the future, and that can be rolled out directly without single-step transitions. TD-VAE is trained on pairs of temporally separated time points, using an analogue of temporal difference learning used in reinforcement learning.	4	121	4	0	21	5.669421487603308
10	Human conversations naturally evolve around related entities and connected concepts, while may also shift from topic to topic. This paper presents ConceptFlow, which leverages commonsense knowledge graphs to explicitly model such conversation flows for better conversation response generation. ConceptFlow grounds the conversation inputs to the latent concept space and represents the potential conversation flow as a concept flow along the commonsense relations. The concept is guided by a graph attention mechanism that models the possibility of the conversation evolving towards different concepts. The conversation response is then decoded using the encodings of both utterance texts and concept flows, integrating the learned conversation structure in the concept space. Our experiments on Reddit conversations demonstrate the advantage of ConceptFlow over previous commonsense aware dialog models and fine-tuned GPT-2 models, while using much fewer parameters but with explicit modeling of conversation structures.	5	139	5	1	18	6.345323741007192
01	Depthwise separable convolutions reduce the number of parameters and computation used in convolutional operations while increasing representational efficiency.They have been shown to be successful in image classification models, both in obtaining better models than previously possible for a given parameter count (the Xception architecture) and considerably reducing the number of parameters required to perform at a given level (the MobileNets family of architectures). Recently, convolutional sequence-to-sequence networks have been applied to machine translation tasks with good results. In this work, we study how depthwise separable convolutions can be applied to neural machine translation. We introduce a new architecture inspired by Xception and ByteNet, called SliceNet, which enables a significant reduction of the parameter count and amount of computation needed to obtain results like ByteNet, and, with a similar parameter count, achieves better results.In addition to showing that depthwise separable convolutions perform well for machine translation, we investigate the architectural changes that they enable: we observe that thanks to depthwise separability, we can increase the length of convolution windows, removing the need for filter dilation. We also introduce a new super-separable convolution operation that further reduces the number of parameters and computational cost of the models.	7	197	2	0	12	6.177664974619289
10	 Discrete latent-variable models, while applicable in a variety of settings, can often be difficult to learn. Sampling discrete latent variables can result in high-variance gradient estimators for two primary reasons: 1) branching on the samples within the model, and 2) the lack of a pathwise derivative for the samples. While current state-of-the-art methods employ control-variate schemes for the former and continuous-relaxation methods for the latter, their utility is limited by the complexities of implementing and training effective control-variate schemes and the necessity of evaluating (potentially exponentially) many branch paths in the model. Here, we revisit the Reweighted Wake Sleep (RWS; Bornschein and Bengio, 2015) algorithm, and through extensive evaluations, show that it circumvents both these issues, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in learning discrete latent-variable models. Moreover, we observe that, unlike the Importance-weighted Autoencoder, RWS learns better models and inference networks with increasing numbers of particles, and that its benefits extend to continuous latent-variable models as well. Our results suggest that RWS is a competitive, often preferable, alternative for learning deep generative models.	3	172	4	0	15	6.337209302325581
10	Learning rules for neural networks necessarily include some form of regularization. Most regularization techniques are conceptualized and implemented in the space of parameters. However, it is also possible to regularize in the space of functions. Here, we propose to measure networks in an $L^2$ Hilbert space, and test a learning rule that regularizes the distance a network can travel through $L^2$-space each update.  This approach is inspired by the slow movement of gradient descent through parameter space as well as by the natural gradient, which can be derived from a regularization term upon functional change. The resulting learning rule, which we call Hilbert-constrained gradient descent (HCGD), is thus closely related to the natural gradient but regularizes a different and more calculable metric over the space of functions. Experiments show that the HCGD is efficient and leads to considerably better generalization. 	8	140	5	0	33	5.664285714285715
10	Factorization Machines (FMs) is an important supervised learning approach due to its unique ability to capture feature interactions when dealing with high-dimensional sparse data. However, FMs assume each sample is independently observed and hence incapable of exploiting the interactions among samples. On the contrary, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has become increasingly popular due to its strength at capturing the dependencies among samples. But unfortunately, it cannot efficiently handle high-dimensional sparse data, which is quite common in modern machine learning tasks.  In this work, to leverage their complementary advantages and yet overcome their issues,  we proposed a novel approach, namely Deep Relational Factorization Machines,  which can capture both the feature interaction and the sample interaction. In particular, we disclosed the relationship between the feature interaction and the graph, which opens a brand new avenue to deal with high-dimensional features. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with experiments on several real-world datasets.	4	153	0	0	0	6.189542483660131
10	We revisit the bias-variance tradeoff for neural networks in light of modern empirical findings. The traditional bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning suggests that as model complexity grows, variance increases. Classical bounds in statistical learning theory point to the number of parameters in a model as a measure of model complexity, which means the tradeoff would indicate that variance increases with the size of neural networks. However, we empirically find that variance due to training set sampling is roughly constant (with both width and depth) in practice. Variance caused by the non-convexity of the loss landscape is different. We find that it decreases with width and increases with depth, in our setting. We provide theoretical analysis, in a simplified setting inspired by linear models, that is consistent with our empirical findings for width. We view bias-variance as a useful lens to study generalization through and encourage further theoretical explanation from this perspective.	10	151	4	0	19	5.6821192052980125
10	Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most widely used recurrent structures in sequence modeling. Its goal is to use gates to control the information flow (e.g., whether to skip some information/transformation or not) in the recurrent computations, although its practical implementation based on soft gates only partially achieves this goal and is easy to overfit. In this paper, we propose a new way for LSTM training, which pushes the values of the gates towards 0 or 1. By doing so, we can (1) better control the information flow: the gates are mostly open or closed, instead of in a middle state; and (2) avoid overfitting to certain extent: the gates operate at their flat regions, which is shown to correspond to better generalization ability. However, learning towards discrete values of the gates is generally difficult. To tackle this challenge, we leverage the recently developed Gumbel-Softmax trick from the field of variational methods, and make the model trainable with standard backpropagation. Experimental results on language modeling and machine translation show that (1) the values of the gates generated by our method are more reasonable and intuitively interpretable, and (2) our proposed method generalizes better and achieves better accuracy on test sets in all tasks. Moreover, the learnt models are not sensitive to low-precision approximation and low-rank approximation of the gate parameters due to the flat loss surface.	7	228	5	0	20	5.38157894736842
10	The tremendous success of deep generative models on generating continuous datalike image and audio has been achieved; however, few deep graph generative modelshave been proposed to generate discrete data such as graphs. The recently proposedapproaches are typically unconditioned generative models which have nocontrol over modes of the graphs being generated. Differently, in this paper, weare interested in a new problem named Deep Graph Translation: given an inputgraph, the goal is to infer a target graph by learning their underlying translationmapping. Graph translation could be highly desirable in many applications suchas disaster management and rare event forecasting, where the rare and abnormalgraph patterns (e.g., traffic congestions and terrorism events) will be inferred priorto their occurrence even without historical data on the abnormal patterns for thisspecific graph (e.g., a road network or human contact network). To this end, wepropose a novel Graph-Translation-Generative Adversarial Networks (GT-GAN)which translates one mode of the input graphs to its target mode. GT-GAN consistsof a graph translator where we propose new graph convolution and deconvolutionlayers to learn the global and local translation mapping. A new conditionalgraph discriminator has also been proposed to classify target graphs by conditioningon input graphs. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-worlddatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed GT-GAN.	3	225	0	0	0	5.742222222222222
10	Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is an extremely useful component of modern neural network architectures, enabling optimization using higher learning rates and achieving faster convergence. In this paper, we use mean-field theory to analytically quantify the impact of BatchNorm on the geometry of the loss landscape for multi-layer networks consisting of fully-connected and convolutional layers. We show that it has a flattening effect on the loss landscape, as quantified by the maximum eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix. These findings are then used to justify the use of larger learning rates for networks that use BatchNorm, and we provide quantitative characterization of the maximal allowable learning rate to ensure convergence. Experiments support our theoretically predicted maximum learning rate, and furthermore suggest that networks with smaller values of the BatchNorm parameter achieve lower loss after the same number of epochs of training.	5	139	5	0	0	5.956834532374103
01	We give a simple, fast algorithm for hyperparameter optimization inspired by techniques from the analysis of Boolean functions.  We focus on the high-dimensional regime where the canonical example is training a neural network with a large number of hyperparameters. The algorithm --- an iterative application of compressed sensing techniques for orthogonal polynomials --- requires only uniform sampling of the hyperparameters and is thus easily parallelizable. Experiments for training deep neural networks on Cifar-10 show that compared to state-of-the-art tools (e.g., Hyperband and Spearmint), our algorithm finds significantly improved solutions, in some cases better than what is attainable by hand-tuning.  In terms of overall running time (i.e., time required to sample various settings of hyperparameters plus additional computation time), we are at least an order of magnitude faster than Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization.  We also outperform Random Search $8\times$.   Our method is inspired by provably-efficient algorithms for learning decision trees using the discrete Fourier transform.  We obtain improved sample-complexty bounds for learning decision trees while matching state-of-the-art bounds on running time (polynomial and quasipolynomial, respectively). 	5	174	4	0	11	6.32183908045977

Meanwhile, neural networksutilizing symmetry invariant layers have been shown to be able to optimize theirtraining objective in a data-efficient way. In this spirit, we present an architecturewhich allows to produce valid Euclidean distance matrices, which by construction are already invariant under rotation and translation of the described object.Motivated by the goal to generate molecular structures in Cartesian space, we usethis architecture to construct a Wasserstein GAN utilizing a permutation invariant critic network. This makes it possible to generate molecular structures in aone-shot fashion by producing Euclidean distance matrices which have a three-dimensional embedding.	5	116	4	0	27	6.181034482758621
10	With innovations in architecture design, deeper and wider neural network models deliver improved performance on a diverse variety of tasks. But the increased memory footprint of these models presents a challenge during training, when all intermediate layer activations need to be stored for back-propagation. Limited GPU memory forces practitioners to make sub-optimal choices: either train inefficiently with smaller batches of examples; or limit the architecture to have lower depth and width, and fewer layers at higher spatial resolutions. This work introduces an approximation strategy that significantly reduces a network's memory footprint during training, but has negligible effect on training performance and computational expense. During the forward pass, we replace activations with lower-precision approximations immediately after they have been used by subsequent layers, thus freeing up memory. The approximate activations are then used during the backward pass. This approach limits the accumulation of errors across the forward and backward pass---because the forward computation across the network still happens at full precision, and the approximation has a limited effect when computing gradients to a layer's input. Experiments, on CIFAR and ImageNet, show that using our approach with 8- and even 4-bit fixed-point approximations of 32-bit floating-point activations has only a minor effect on training and validation performance, while affording significant savings in memory usage.	8	212	4	0	18	6.099056603773584
10	This paper considers a new variant of AMSGrad called Optimistic-AMSGrad. AMSGrad is a popular adaptive gradient based optimization algorithm that is widely used in training deep neural networks. The new variant assumes that mini-batch gradients in consecutive iterations have some underlying structure, which makes the gradients sequentially predictable. By exploiting the predictability and some ideas from Optimistic Online learning, the proposed algorithm can accelerate the convergence and also enjoys a tighter regret bound. We evaluate Optimistic-AMSGrad and AMSGrad in terms of various performance measures (i.e., training loss, testing loss, and classification accuracy on training/testing data), which demonstrate that Optimistic-AMSGrad improves AMSGrad.	5	101	0	0	0	6.574257425742574
01	Neural network quantization has become an important research area due to its great impact on deployment of large models on resource constrained devices. In order to train networks that can be effectively discretized without loss of performance, we introduce a differentiable quantization procedure. Differentiability can be achieved by transforming continuous distributions over the weights and activations of the network to categorical distributions over the quantization grid. These are subsequently relaxed to continuous surrogates that can allow for efficient gradient-based optimization. We further show that stochastic rounding can be seen as a special case of the proposed approach and that under this formulation the quantization grid itself can also be optimized with gradient descent. We experimentally validate the performance of our method on MNIST, CIFAR 10 and Imagenet classification.	6	128	4	0	14	6.03125
10	Work on the problem of contextualized word representation—the development of reusable neural network components for sentence understanding—has recently seen a  surge of progress centered on the unsupervised pretraining task of language modeling with methods like ELMo (Peters et al., 2018). This paper contributes the first large-scale systematic study comparing different pretraining tasks in this context, both as complements to language modeling and as potential alternatives. The primary results of the study support the use of language modeling as a pretraining task and set a new state of the art among comparable models using multitask learning with language models. However, a closer look at these results reveals worryingly strong baselines and strikingly varied results across target tasks, suggesting that the widely-used paradigm of pretraining and freezing sentence encoders may not be an ideal platform for further work.	9	136	3	0	28	5.867647058823527
01	"We study the generalization properties of deep convolutional neural networks for image denoising in the presence of varying noise levels. We provide extensive empirical evidence that current state-of-the-art architectures systematically overfit to the noise levels in the training set, performing very poorly at new noise levels. We show that strong generalization can be achieved through a simple architectural modification: removing all additive constants. The resulting ""bias-free"" networks attain state-of-the-art performance over a broad range of noise levels, even when trained over a limited range. They are also locally linear, which enables direct analysis with linear-algebraic tools.  We show that the denoising map can be visualized locally as a filter that adapts to both image structure and noise level. In addition, our analysis reveals that deep networks implicitly perform a projection onto an adaptively-selected low-dimensional subspace, with dimensionality inversely proportional to noise level, that captures features of natural images.

01	Sequence-to-sequence models are commonly trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). However, standard MLE training considers a word-level objective, predicting the next word given the previous ground-truth partial sentence. This procedure focuses on modeling local syntactic patterns, and may fail to capture long-range semantic structure. We present a novel solution to alleviate these issues. Our approach imposes global sequence-level guidance via new supervision based on optimal transport, enabling the overall characterization and preservation of semantic features. We further show that this method can be understood as a Wasserstein gradient flow trying to match our model to the ground truth sequence distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the utility of the proposed approach, showing consistent improvements over a wide variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and image captioning.	6	131	4	0	0	6.374045801526719
01	Point clouds, as a form of Lagrangian representation, allow for powerful and flexible applications in a large number of computational disciplines. We propose a novel deep-learning method to learn stable and temporally coherent feature spaces for points clouds that change over time. We identify a set of inherent problems with these approaches: without knowledge of the time dimension, the inferred solutions can exhibit strong flickering, and easy solutions to suppress this flickering can result in undesirable local minima that manifest themselves as halo structures. We propose a novel temporal loss function that takes into account higher time derivatives of the point positions, and encourages mingling, i.e., to prevent the aforementioned halos. We combine these techniques in a super-resolution method with a truncation approach to flexibly adapt the size of the generated positions. We show that our method works for large, deforming point sets from different sources to demonstrate the flexibility of our approach.	12	153	6	0	12	5.6993464052287575
10	The goal of the paper is to propose an algorithm for learning the most generalizable solution from given training data. It is shown that Bayesian approach leads to a solution that dependent on statistics of training data and not on particularsamples. The solution is stable under perturbations of training data because it is defined by an integral contribution of multiple maxima of the likelihood and not by a single global maximum. Specifically, the Bayesian probability distributionof parameters (weights) of a probabilistic model given by a neural network is estimated via recurrent variational approximations. Derived recurrent update rules correspond to SGD-type rules for finding a minimum of an effective loss that is an average of an original negative log-likelihood over the Gaussian distributions of weights, which makes it a function of means and variances. The effective loss is convex for large variances and non-convex in the limit of small variances. Among stationary solutions of the update rules there are trivial solutions with zero variances at local minima of the original loss and a single non-trivial solution with finite variances that is a critical point at the end of convexity of the effective lossin the mean-variance space. At the critical point both first- and second-order gradients of the effective loss w.r.t. means are zero. The empirical study confirms that the critical point represents the most generalizable solution. While the location ofthe critical point in the weight space depends on specifics of the used probabilistic model some properties at the critical point are universal and model independent.	13	258	4	0	16	5.387596899224807
10	Convolutional neural network (CNN) for time series data implicitly assumes that the data are uniformly sampled, whereas many event-based and multi-modal data are nonuniform or have heterogeneous sampling rates. Directly applying regularCNN to nonuniform time series is ungrounded, because it is unable to recognize and extract common patterns from the nonuniform input signals. Converting the nonuniform time series to uniform ones by interpolation preserves the pattern extraction capability of CNN, but the interpolation kernels are often preset and may be unsuitable for the data or tasks. In this paper, we propose the ContinuousCNN (CCNN), which estimates the inherent continuous inputs by interpolation, and performs continuous convolution on the continuous input. The interpolation and convolution kernels are learned in an end-to-end manner, and are able to learn useful patterns despite the nonuniform sampling rate. Besides, CCNN is a strict generalization to CNN. Results of several experiments verify that CCNN achieves abetter performance on nonuniform data, and learns meaningful continuous kernels	7	159	0	0	0	6.0
10	"Owing to the susceptibility of deep learning systems to adversarial attacks, there has been a great deal of work in developing (both empirically and certifiably) robust classifiers, but the vast majority has defended against single types of attacks. Recent work has looked at defending against multiple attacks, specifically on the MNIST dataset, yet this approach used a relatively complex architecture, claiming that standard adversarial training can not apply because it ""overfits"" to a particular norm. In this work, we show that it is indeed possible to adversarially train a robust model against a union of norm-bounded attacks, by using a natural generalization of the standard PGD-based procedure for adversarial training to multiple threat models. With this approach, we are able to train standard architectures which are robust against l_inf, l_2, and l_1 attacks, outperforming past approaches on the MNIST dataset and providing the first CIFAR10 network trained to be simultaneously robust against (l_inf, l_2, l_1) threat models, which achieves adversarial accuracy rates of (47.6%, 64.3%, 53.4%) for (l_inf, l_2, l_1) perturbations with epsilon radius = (0.03,0.5,12)."	9	176	5	1	28	5.721590909090909
10	We introduce Deep Reasoning Networks (DRNets), an end-to-end framework that combines deep learning with reasoning for solving pattern de-mixing problems, typically in an unsupervised or weakly-supervised setting.  DRNets exploit problem structure and prior knowledge by tightly combining logic and constraint reasoning with stochastic-gradient-based neural network optimization.  We illustrate the power of DRNets on de-mixing overlapping hand-written Sudokus (Multi-MNIST-Sudoku) and on a substantially more complex task in scientific discovery that concerns inferring crystal structures of materials from X-ray diffraction data (Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping). DRNets significantly outperform the state of the art and experts' capabilities on Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping, recovering more precise and physically meaningful crystal structures. On Multi-MNIST-Sudoku, DRNets perfectly recovered the mixed Sudokus' digits, with 100% digit accuracy, outperforming the supervised state-of-the-art MNIST de-mixing models.	10	121	2	0	27	7.43801652892562
10	Bayesian optimization is an effective tool to optimize black-box functions and popular for hyper-parameter tuning in machine learning. Traditional Bayesian optimization methods are based on Gaussian process (GP), relying on a GP-based surrogate model for sampling points of  the function of interest.  In this work, we consider transferring knowledge from related problems to target problem by learning an initial surrogate model for warm-starting Bayesian optimization. We propose a neural network-based surrogate model to estimate the function mean value in GP.  Then we design a novel weighted Reptile algorithm with sampling strategy to learn an initial surrogate model from meta train set. The initial surrogate model is learned to be able to well adapt to new tasks. Extensive experiments show that this warm-starting technique enables us to find better minimizer or hyper-parameters than traditional GP and previous warm-starting methods.	8	138	5	0	0	5.833333333333332
10	Profiling cellular phenotypes from microscopic imaging can provide meaningful biological information resulting from various factors affecting the cells. One motivating application is drug development: morphological cell features can be captured from images, from which similarities between different drugs applied at different dosages can be quantified. The general approach is to find a function mapping the images to an embedding space of manageable dimensionality whose geometry captures relevant features of the input images. An important known issue for such methods is separating relevant biological signal from nuisance variation. For example, the embedding vectors tend to be more correlated for cells that were cultured and imaged during the same week than for cells from a different week, despite having identical drug compounds applied in both cases. In this case, the particular batch a set of experiments were conducted in constitutes the domain of the data; an ideal set of image embeddings should contain only the relevant biological information (e.g. drug effects). We develop a general framework for adjusting the image embeddings in order to `forget' domain-specific information while preserving relevant biological information. To do this, we minimize a loss function based on distances between marginal distributions (such as the Wasserstein distance) of embeddings across domains for each replicated treatment. For the dataset presented, the replicated treatment is the negative control. We find that for our transformed embeddings (1) the underlying geometric structure is not only preserved but the embeddings also carry improved biological signal (2) less domain-specific information is present.	6	248	3	0	14	5.935483870967742
10	Although adaptive algorithms have achieved significant success in training deep neural networks with faster training speed, they tend to have poor generalization performance compared to SGD with Momentum(SGDM). One of the state-of-the-art algorithms, PADAM, is proposed to close the generalization gap of adaptive methods while lacking an internal explanation. This work pro- poses a general framework, in which we use an explicit function Φ(·) as an adjustment to the actual step size, and present a more adaptive specific form AdaPlus(Ada+). Based on this framework, we analyze various behaviors brought by different types of Φ(·), such as a constant function in SGDM, a linear function in Adam, a concave function in Padam and a concave function with offset term in AdaPlus. Empirically, we conduct experiments on classic benchmarks both in CNN and RNN architectures and achieve better performance(even than SGDM).	12	139	4	1	32	5.604316546762591
01	In this paper, we present an approach to learn recomposable motor primitives across large-scale and diverse manipulation demonstrations. Current approaches to decomposing demonstrations into primitives often assume manually defined primitives and bypass the difficulty of discovering these primitives. On the other hand, approaches in primitive discovery put restrictive assumptions on the complexity of a primitive, which limit applicability to narrow tasks. Our approach attempts to circumvent these challenges by jointly learning both the underlying motor primitives and recomposing these primitives to form the original demonstration. Through constraints on both the parsimony of primitive decomposition and the simplicity of a given primitive, we are able to learn a diverse set of motor primitives, as well as a coherent latent representation for these primitives. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively, that our learned primitives capture semantically meaningful aspects of a demonstration. This allows us to compose these primitives in a hierarchical reinforcement learning setup to efficiently solve robotic manipulation tasks like reaching and pushing.

10	We present a novel approach for training neural abstract architectures which in- corporates (partial) supervision over the machine’s interpretable components. To cleanly capture the set of neural architectures to which our method applies, we introduce the concept of a differential neural computational machine (∂NCM) and show that several existing architectures (e.g., NTMs, NRAMs) can be instantiated as a ∂NCM and can thus benefit from any amount of additional supervision over their interpretable components. Based on our method, we performed a detailed experimental evaluation with both, the NTM and NRAM architectures, and showed that the approach leads to significantly better convergence and generalization capabilities of the learning phase than when training using only input-output examples.	6	114	5	0	17	6.043859649122808
01	We improve the recently-proposed ``MixMatch semi-supervised learning algorithm by introducing two new techniques: distribution alignment and augmentation anchoring.- Distribution alignment encourages the marginal distribution of predictions on unlabeled data to be close to the marginal distribution of ground-truth labels.- Augmentation anchoring} feeds multiple strongly augmented versions of an input into the model and encourages each output to be close to the prediction for a weakly-augmented version of the same input.To produce strong augmentations, we propose a variant of AutoAugment which learns the augmentation policy while the model is being trained.Our new algorithm, dubbed ReMixMatch, is significantly more data-efficient than prior work, requiring between 5 times and 16 times less data to reach the same accuracy. For example, on CIFAR-10 with 250 labeled examples we reach 93.73% accuracy (compared to MixMatch's accuracy of 93.58% with 4000 examples) and a median accuracy of 84.92% with just four labels per class.	9	152	1	1	28	5.848684210526316
01	Probabilistic modelling is a principled framework to perform model aggregation, which has been a primary mechanism to combat mode collapse in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for GANs, ProbGAN, which iteratively learns a distribution over generators with a carefully crafted prior. Learning is efficiently triggered by a tailored stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with a novel gradient approximation to perform Bayesian inference. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that our treatment is the first probabilistic framework that yields an equilibrium where generator distributions are faithful to the data distribution. Empirical evidence on synthetic high-dimensional multi-modal data and image databases (CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet) demonstrates the superiority of our method over both start-of-the-art multi-generator GANs and other probabilistic treatment for GANs.	7	130	9	0	9	6.438461538461539
10	Naively applying Reinforcement Learning algorithms to continuous control problems -- such as locomotion and robot control -- to maximize task reward often results in policies which rely on high-amplitude, high-frequency control signals, known colloquially as bang-bang control. While such policies can implement the optimal solution, particularly in simulated systems, they are often not desirable for real world systems since bang-bang control can lead to increased wear and tear and energy consumption and tends to excite undesired second-order dynamics. To counteract this issue, multi-objective optimization can be used to simultaneously optimize both the reward and some auxiliary cost that discourages undesired (e.g. high-amplitude) control. In principle, such an approach can yield the sought after, smooth, control policies. It can, however, be hard to find the correct trade-off between cost and return that results in the desired behavior. In this paper we propose a new constraint-based approach which defines a lower bound on the return while minimizing one or more costs (such as control effort). We employ Lagrangian relaxation to learn both (a) the parameters of a control policy that satisfies the desired constraints and (b) the Lagrangian multipliers for the optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate policy optimization which satisfies constraints either in expectation or in a per-step fashion, and we learn a single conditional policy that is able to dynamically change the trade-off between return and cost. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach using a number of continuous control benchmark tasks as well as a realistic, energy-optimized quadruped locomotion task.	9	249	5	0	31	5.807228915662651
10	Detecting communities or the modular structure of real-life networks (e.g. a socialnetwork or a product purchase network) is an important task because the way anetwork functions is often determined by its communities.The traditional approaches to community detection involve modularity-based approaches,which generally speaking, construct partitions based on heuristics thatseek to maximize the ratio of the edges within the partitions to those betweenthem. Node embedding approaches, which represent each node in a graph as areal-valued vector, transform the problem of community detection in a graph tothat of clustering a set of vectors. Existing node embedding approaches are primarilybased on first initiating uniform random walks from each node to constructa context of a node and then seeks to make the vector representation ofthe node close to its context. However, standard node embedding approaches donot directly take into account the community structure of a network while constructingthe context around each node. To alleviate this, we explore two differentthreads of work. First, we investigate the use of biased random walks (specifically,maximum entropy based walks) to obtain more centrality preserving embeddingof nodes, which we hypothesize may lead to more effective clusters in the embeddedspace. Second, we propose a community structure aware node embeddingapproach where we incorporate modularity-based partitioning heuristics intothe objective function of node embedding. We demonstrate that our proposed approachfor community detection outperforms a number of modularity-based baselinesas well as K-means on a standard node-embedded vector space (specifically,node2vec) on a wide range of real-life networks of different sizes and densities.	4	267	3	0	21	5.700374531835205
10	In this research, we present a novel learning scheme called network iterative learning for deep neural networks. Different from traditional optimization algorithms that usually optimize directly on a static objective function, we propose in this work to optimize a dynamic objective function in an iterative fashion capable of adapting its function form when being optimized. The optimization is implemented as a series of intermediate neural net functions that is able to dynamically grow into the targeted neural net objective function. This is done via network morphism so that the network knowledge is fully preserved with each network growth. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network iterative learning scheme is able to significantly alleviate the degradation problem. Its effectiveness is verified on diverse benchmark datasets.	10	124	2	0	0	5.887096774193548
10	We apply canonical forms of gradient complexes (barcodes) to explore neural networks loss surfaces. We present an algorithm for calculations of the objective function's barcodes of minima.  Our experiments confirm two principal observations: (1) the barcodes of minima are located in a small lower part of the range of values of objective function and (2) increase of the neural network's depth brings down the minima's barcodes. This has natural implications for the neural network learning and the ability to generalize. 	7	80	4	0	14	5.525
01	We propose an end-to-end-trainable attention module for convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures built for image classification. The module takes as input the 2D feature vector maps which form the intermediate representations of the input image at different stages in the CNN pipeline, and outputs a 2D matrix of scores for each map. Standard CNN architectures are modified through the incorporation of this module, and trained under the constraint that a convex combination of the intermediate 2D feature vectors, as parametrised by the score matrices, must alone be used for classification. Incentivised to amplify the relevant and suppress the irrelevant or misleading, the scores thus assume the role of attention values. Our experimental observations provide clear evidence to this effect: the learned attention maps neatly highlight the regions of interest while suppressing background clutter. Consequently, the proposed function is able to bootstrap standard CNN architectures for the task of image classification, demonstrating superior generalisation over 6 unseen benchmark datasets. When binarised, our attention maps outperform other CNN-based attention maps, traditional saliency maps, and top object proposals for weakly supervised segmentation as demonstrated on the Object Discovery dataset. We also demonstrate improved robustness against the fast gradient sign method of adversarial attack.	4	200	7	0	23	6.09

We then investigate a series of increasingly complex deep generative models of tokens given tags enabled by end-to-end optimization, comparing the proposed models against supervised and strong CRF SSL baselines on the Ontonotes5 NER dataset. We find that our best proposed model consistently improves performance by $\approx 1\%$ F1 in low- and moderate-resource regimes and easily addresses degenerate model behavior in a more difficult, partially supervised setting.	6	121	6	0	21	5.867768595041323
10	We describe an explainable AI saliency map method for use with deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that is much more efficient than popular gradient methods. It is also quantitatively similar or better in accuracy. Our technique works by measuring information at the end of each network scale. This is then combined into a single saliency map. We describe how saliency measures can be made more efficient by exploiting Saliency Map Order Equivalence.  Finally, we visualize individual scale/layer contributions by using a Layer Ordered Visualization of Information. This provides an interesting comparison of scale information contributions within the network not provided by other saliency map methods.  Our method is generally straight forward and should be applicable to the most commonly used CNNs. (Full source code is available at http://www.anonymous.submission.com).	6	128	4	0	15	5.859375
01	We address the following question: How redundant is the parameterisation of ReLU networks? Specifically, we consider transformations of the weight space which leave the function implemented by the network intact. Two such transformations are known for feed-forward architectures: permutation of neurons within a layer, and positive scaling of all incoming weights of a neuron coupled with inverse scaling of its outgoing weights. In this work, we show for architectures with non-increasing widths that permutation and scaling are in fact the only function-preserving weight transformations. For any eligible architecture we give an explicit construction of a neural network such that any other network that implements the same function can be obtained from the original one by the application of permutations and rescaling. The proof relies on a geometric understanding of boundaries between linear regions of ReLU networks, and we hope the developed mathematical tools are of independent interest.	7	147	4	0	18	5.795918367346939
10	In semi-supervised learning, Bad GAN approach is one of the most attractive method due to the intuitional simplicity and powerful performances. Bad GAN learns a classifier with bad samples distributed on complement of the support of the input data. But Bad GAN needs additional architectures, a generator and a density estimation model, which involves huge computation and memory consumption cost. VAT is another good semi-supervised learning algorithm, whichutilizes unlabeled data to improve the invariance of the classifier with respect to perturbation of inputs.  In this study, we propose a new method by combining the ideas of Bad GAN and VAT. The proposed method generates bad samples of high-quality by use of the adversarial training used in VAT. We give theoretical explanations why the adversarial training is good at both generating bad samples and semi-supervised learning. An advantage of the proposed method is to achieve the competitive performances with much fewer computations. We demonstrate advantages our method by various experiments with well known benchmark image datasets.	6	166	3	0	12	5.614457831325301
10	A plethora of computer vision tasks, such as optical flow and image alignment, can be formulated as non-linear optimization problems. Before the resurgence of deep learning, the dominant family for solving such optimization problems was numerical optimization, e.g, Gauss-Newton (GN). More recently, several attempts were made to formulate learnable GN steps as cascade regression architectures. In this paper, we investigate recent machine learning architectures, such as deep neural networks with residual connections, under the above perspective. To this end, we first demonstrate how residual blocks (when considered as discretization of ODEs) can be viewed as GN steps. Then, we go a step further and propose a new residual block, that is reminiscent of Newton's method in numerical optimization and exhibits faster convergence. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed Newton-ResNet by conducting experiments on image and speech classification and image generation, using 4 datasets. All the experiments demonstrate that Newton-ResNet requires less parameters to achieve the same performance with the original ResNet.	3	160	3	0	22	5.99375
10	Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is used to infer the reward function from the actions of an expert running a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A novel approach using variational inference for learning the reward function is proposed in this research. Using this technique, the intractable posterior distribution of the continuous latent variable (the reward function in this case) is analytically approximated to appear to be as close to the prior belief while trying to reconstruct the future state conditioned on the current state and action. The reward function is derived using a well-known deep generative model known as Conditional Variational Auto-encoder (CVAE) with Wasserstein loss function, thus referred to as Conditional Wasserstein Auto-encoder-IRL (CWAE-IRL), which can be analyzed as a combination of the backward and forward inference. This can then form an efficient alternative to the previous approaches to IRL while having no knowledge of the system dynamics of the agent. Experimental results on standard benchmarks such as objectworld and pendulum show that the proposed algorithm can effectively learn the latent reward function in complex, high-dimensional environments.	10	176	3	0	15	5.806818181818183
01	Recent improvements to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made it possible to generate realistic images in high resolution based on natural language descriptions such as image captions. Furthermore, conditional GANs allow us to control the image generation process through labels or even natural language descriptions. However, fine-grained control of the image layout, i.e. where in the image specific objects should be located, is still difficult to achieve. This is especially true for images that should contain multiple distinct objects at different spatial locations. We introduce a new approach which allows us to control the location of arbitrarily many objects within an image by adding an object pathway to both the generator and the discriminator. Our approach does not need a detailed semantic layout but only bounding boxes and the respective labels of the desired objects are needed. The object pathway focuses solely on the individual objects and is iteratively applied at the locations specified by the bounding boxes. The global pathway focuses on the image background and the general image layout. We perform experiments on the Multi-MNIST, CLEVR, and the more complex MS-COCO data set. Our experiments show that through the use of the object pathway we can control object locations within images and can model complex scenes with multiple objects at various locations. We further show that the object pathway focuses on the individual objects and learns features relevant for these, while the global pathway focuses on global image characteristics and the image background.	7	245	5	0	16	5.538775510204082

10	Recent years have witnessed two seemingly opposite developments of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). On one hand, increasing the density of CNNs by adding cross-layer connections achieve higher accuracy. On the other hand, creating sparsity structures through regularization and pruning methods enjoys lower computational costs. In this paper, we bridge these two by proposing a new network structure with locally dense yet externally sparse connections. This new structure uses dense modules, as basic building blocks and then sparsely connects these modules via a novel algorithm during the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the locally dense yet externally sparse structure could acquire competitive performance on benchmark tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet) while keeping the network structure slim.	11	117	4	0	22	6.188034188034187
10	By maximizing an information theoretic objective, a few recent methods empower the agent to explore the environment and learn useful skills without supervision. However, when considering to use multiple consecutive skills to complete a specific task, the transition from one to another cannot guarantee the success of the process due to the evident gap between skills. In this paper, we propose to learn transitional skills (LTS) in addition to creating diverse primitive skills without a reward function. By introducing an extra latent variable for transitional skills, our LTS method discovers both primitive and transitional skills by minimizing the difference of mutual information and the similarity of skills. By considering various simulated robotic tasks, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of LTS on learning both diverse primitive skills and transitional skills, and show its superiority in smooth transition of skills over the state-of-the-art baseline DIAYN.	6	143	0	0	0	5.839160839160839

Specifically:1) We develop ML-PIP, a general framework for Meta-Learning approximate Probabilistic Inference for Prediction. ML-PIP extends existing probabilistic interpretations of meta-learning to cover a broad class of methods. 2) We introduce \Versa{}, an instance of the framework employing a flexible and versatile amortization network that takes few-shot learning datasets as inputs, with arbitrary numbers of shots, and outputs a distribution over task-specific parameters in a single forward pass. \Versa{} substitutes optimization at test time with forward passes through inference networks, amortizing the cost of inference and relieving the need for second derivatives during training.3) We evaluate \Versa{} on benchmark datasets where the method sets new state-of-the-art results, and can handle arbitrary number of shots, and for classification, arbitrary numbers of classes at train and test time. The power of the approach is then demonstrated through a challenging few-shot ShapeNet view reconstruction task.	5	156	4	0	28	6.115384615384616
10	Convex relaxations are effective for training and certifying neural networks against norm-bounded adversarial attacks, but they leave a large gap between certifiable and empirical (PGD) robustness. In principle, relaxation can provide tight bounds if the convex relaxation solution is feasible for the original non-relaxed problem. Therefore, we propose two regularizers that can be used to train neural networks that yield convex relaxations with tighter bounds. In all of our experiments, the proposed regularizations result in tighter certification bounds than non-regularized baselines. 	6	81	3	0	0	6.296296296296298
10	In human perception and cognition, a fundamental operation that brains perform is interpretation: constructing coherent neural states from noisy, incomplete, and intrinsically ambiguous evidence. The problem of interpretation is well matched to an early and often overlooked architecture, the attractor network---a recurrent neural net that performs constraint satisfaction, imputation of missing features, and clean up of noisy data via energy minimization dynamics. We revisit attractor nets in light of modern deep learning methods and propose a convolutional bipartite architecture with a novel training loss, activation function, and connectivity constraints. We tackle larger problems than have been previously explored with attractor nets and demonstrate their potential for image completion and super-resolution. We argue that this architecture is better motivated than ever-deeper feedforward models and is a viable alternative to more costly sampling-based generative methods on a range of supervised and unsupervised tasks.	4	141	6	1	27	6.340425531914892
10	We consider the problem of improving kernel approximation via feature maps. These maps arise as Monte Carlo approximation to integral representations of kernel functions and scale up kernel methods for larger datasets. We propose to use more efficient numerical integration technique to obtain better estimates of the integrals compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Our approach allows to use information about the integrand to enhance approximation and facilitates fast computations. We derive the convergence behavior and conduct an extensive empirical study that supports our hypothesis.	5	84	4	0	5	6.083333333333332
01	One of the challenges in the study of generative adversarial networks is the instability of its training. In this paper, we propose a novel weight normalization technique called spectral normalization to stabilize the training of the discriminator.Our new normalization technique is computationally light and easy to incorporate into existing implementations. We tested the efficacy of spectral normalization on CIFAR10, STL-10, and ILSVRC2012 dataset, and we experimentally confirmed that spectrally normalized GANs (SN-GANs) is capable of generating images of better or equal quality relative to the previous training stabilization techniques. 	6	90	3	0	19	6.188888888888887
01	Self-attention is a useful mechanism to build generative models for language and images. It determines the importance of context elements by comparing each element to the current time step. In this paper, we show that a very lightweight convolution can perform competitively to the best reported self-attention results. Next, we introduce dynamic convolutions which are simpler and more efficient than self-attention. We predict separate convolution kernels based solely on the current time-step in order to determine the importance of context elements. The number of operations required by this approach scales linearly in the input length, whereas self-attention is quadratic. Experiments on large-scale machine translation, language modeling and abstractive summarization show that dynamic convolutions improve over strong self-attention models. On the WMT'14 English-German test set dynamic convolutions achieve a new state of the art of 29.7 BLEU.	8	136	4	0	10	6.007352941176473
10	Most deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems are not able to learn effectively from off-policy data, especially if they cannot explore online in the environment. This is a critical shortcoming for applying RL to real-world problems where collecting data is expensive, and models must be tested offline before being deployed to interact with the environment -- e.g. systems that learn from human interaction. Thus, we develop a novel class of off-policy batch RL algorithms which use KL-control to penalize divergence from a pre-trained prior model of probable actions. This KL-constraint reduces extrapolation error, enabling effective offline learning, without exploration, from a fixed batch of data. We also use dropout-based uncertainty estimates to lower bound the target Q-values as a more efficient alternative to Double Q-Learning. This Way Off-Policy (WOP) algorithm is tested on both traditional RL tasks from OpenAI Gym, and on the problem of open-domain dialog generation; a challenging reinforcement learning problem with a 20,000 dimensional action space. WOP allows for the extraction of multiple different reward functions post-hoc from collected human interaction data, and can learn effectively from all of these. We test real-world generalization by deploying dialog models live to converse with humans in an open-domain setting, and demonstrate that WOP achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art prior methods in batch deep RL.	11	214	5	1	30	5.8364485981308425
10	With the success of deep neural networks, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) as a way of automatic model design has attracted wide attention. As training every child model from scratch is very time-consuming, recent works leverage weight-sharing to speed up the model evaluation procedure. These approaches greatly reduce computation by maintaining a single copy of weights on the super-net and share the weights among every child model. However, weight-sharing has no theoretical guarantee and its impact has not been well studied before. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive experiments to reveal the impact of weight-sharing: (1) The best-performing models from different runs or even from consecutive epochs within the same run have significant variance; (2) Even with high variance, we can extract valuable information from training the super-net with shared weights; (3) The interference between child models is a main factor that induces high variance; (4) Properly reducing the degree of weight sharing could effectively reduce variance and improve performance.	9	159	6	1	12	5.735849056603772
01	A dynamical neural network consists of a set of interconnected neurons that interact over time continuously. It can exhibit computational properties in the sense that the dynamical system’s evolution and/or limit points in the associated state space can correspond to numerical solutions to certain mathematical optimization or learning problems. Such a computational system is particularly attractive in that it can be mapped to a massively parallel computer architecture for power and throughput efficiency, especially if each neuron can rely solely on local information (i.e., local memory). Deriving gradients from the dynamical network’s various states while conforming to this last constraint, however, is challenging. We show that by combining ideas of top-down feedback and contrastive learning, a dynamical network for solving the l1-minimizing dictionary learning problem can be constructed, and the true gradients for learning are provably computable by individual neurons. Using spiking neurons to construct our dynamical network, we present a learning process, its rigorous mathematical analysis, and numerical results on several dictionary learning problems.	7	165	8	0	0	6.1090909090909085
10	This paper proposes a new approach for step size adaptation in gradient methods. The proposed method called step size optimization (SSO) formulates the step size adaptation as an optimization problem which minimizes the loss function with respect to the step size for the given model parameters and gradients. Then, the step size is optimized based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). SSO does not require the second-order information or any probabilistic models for adapting the step size, so it is efficient and easy to implement. Furthermore, we also introduce stochastic SSO for stochastic learning environments. In the experiments, we integrated SSO to vanilla SGD and Adam, and they outperformed state-of-the-art adaptive gradient methods including RMSProp, Adam, L4-Adam, and AdaBound on extensive benchmark datasets.	3	124	3	0	14	5.806451612903228
01	Graph neural networks have recently achieved great successes in predicting quantum mechanical properties of molecules. These models represent a molecule as a graph using only the distance between atoms (nodes). They do not, however, consider the spatial direction from one atom to another, despite directional information playing a central role in empirical potentials for molecules, e.g. in angular potentials. To alleviate this limitation we propose directional message passing, in which we embed the messages passed between atoms instead of the atoms themselves. Each message is associated with a direction in coordinate space. These directional message embeddings are rotationally equivariant since the associated directions rotate with the molecule. We propose a message passing scheme analogous to belief propagation, which uses the directional information by transforming messages based on the angle between them. Additionally, we use spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics to construct theoretically well-founded, orthogonal representations that achieve better performance than the currently prevalent Gaussian radial basis representations while using fewer than 1/4 of the parameters. We leverage these innovations to construct the directional message passing neural network (DimeNet). DimeNet outperforms previous GNNs on average by 76% on MD17 and by 31% on QM9. Our implementation is available online.	6	199	6	1	12	6.165829145728643
01	Deep learning models for graphs have advanced the state of the art on many tasks. Despite their recent success, little is known about their robustness. We investigate training time attacks on graph neural networks for node classification that perturb the discrete graph structure.  Our core principle is to use meta-gradients to solve the bilevel problem underlying training-time attacks, essentially treating the graph as a hyperparameter to optimize. Our experiments show that small graph perturbations consistently lead to a strong decrease in performance for graph convolutional networks, and even transfer to unsupervised embeddings. Remarkably, the perturbations created by our algorithm can misguide the graph neural networks such that they perform worse than a simple baseline that ignores all relational information. Our attacks do not assume any knowledge about or access to the target classifiers.	9	133	5	0	14	5.8270676691729335
01	Intriguing empirical evidence exists that deep learning can work well with exotic schedules for varying the learning rate. This paper suggests that the phenomenon may be due to Batch Normalization or BN(Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), which is ubiq- uitous and provides benefits in optimization and generalization across all standard architectures. The following new results are shown about BN with weight decay and momentum (in other words, the typical use case which was not considered in earlier theoretical analyses of stand-alone BN (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015; Santurkar et al., 2018; Arora et al., 2018)• Training can be done using SGD with momentum and an exponentially in- creasing learning rate schedule, i.e., learning rate increases by some (1 + α) factor in every epoch for some α > 0. (Precise statement in the paper.) To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a rate schedule has been successfully used, let alone for highly successful architectures. As ex- pected, such training rapidly blows up network weights, but the net stays well-behaved due to normalization.• Mathematical explanation of the success of the above rate schedule: a rigor- ous proof that it is equivalent to the standard setting of BN + SGD + Standard Rate Tuning + Weight Decay + Momentum. This equivalence holds for other normalization layers as well, Group Normalization(Wu & He, 2018), Layer Normalization(Ba et al., 2016), Instance Norm(Ulyanov et al., 2016), etc.• A worked-out toy example illustrating the above linkage of hyper- parameters. Using either weight decay or BN alone reaches global minimum, but convergence fails when both are used.	8	266	4	0	29	5.184210526315789
10	  Pruning is an efficient model compression technique to remove redundancy in the connectivity of deep neural networks (DNNs). A critical problem to represent sparse matrices after pruning is that if fewer bits are used for quantization and pruning rate is enhanced, then the amount of index becomes relatively larger. Moreover, an irregular index form leads to low parallelism for convolutions and matrix multiplications. In this paper, we propose a new network pruning technique that generates a low-rank binary index matrix to compress index data significantly. Specifically, the proposed compression method finds a particular fine-grained pruning mask that can be decomposed into two binary matrices while decompressing index data is performed by simple binary matrix multiplication. We also propose a tile-based factorization technique that not only lowers memory requirements but also enhances compression ratio. Various DNN models (including conv layers and LSTM layers) can be pruned with much fewer indices compared to previous sparse matrix formats while maintaining the same pruning rate.	6	161	5	0	13	5.8198757763975175
10	Recent advances in Deep Learning have led to a significant performance increase on several NLP tasks, however, the models become more and more computationally demanding. Therefore, this paper tackles the domain of computationally efficient algorithms for NLP tasks. In particular, it investigates distributed representations of n-gram statistics of texts. The representations are formed using hyperdimensional computing enabled embedding. These representations then serve as features, which are used as input to standard classifiers. We investigate the applicability of the embedding on one large and three small standard datasets for classification tasks using nine classifiers.  The embedding achieved on par F1 scores while decreasing the time and memory requirements by several times compared to the conventional n-gram statistics, e.g., for one of the classifiers on a small dataset, the memory reduction was 6.18 times; while train and test speed-ups were 4.62 and 3.84 times, respectively. For many classifiers on the large dataset, the memory reduction was about 100 times and train and test speed-ups were over 100 times. More importantly, the usage of distributed representations formed via hyperdimensional computing allows dissecting the strict dependency between the dimensionality of the representation and the parameters of n-gram statistics, thus, opening a room for tradeoffs.	17	200	5	1	16	5.965
10	Adversarial learning has shown its advances in generating natural and diverse descriptions in image captioning. However, the learned reward of existing adversarial methods is vague and ill-defined due to the reward ambiguity problem. In this paper, we propose a refined Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (rAIRL) method to handle the reward ambiguity problem by disentangling reward for each word in a sentence, as well as achieve stable adversarial training by refining the loss function to shift the stationary point towards Nash equilibrium. In addition, we introduce a conditional term in the loss function to mitigate mode collapse and to increase the diversity of the generated descriptions. Our experiments on MS COCO show that our method can learn compact reward for image captioning.	6	121	5	0	11	5.619834710743802
10	Recurrent networks are a widely used class of neural architectures.  They have, however, two shortcomings. First, it is difficult to understand what exactly they learn. Second, they tend to work poorly on sequences requiring long-term memorization, despite having this capacity in principle. We aim to address both shortcomings with a class of recurrent networks that use a stochastic state transition mechanism between cell applications. This mechanism, which we term state-regularization, makes RNNs transition between a finite set of learnable states. We show that state-regularization (a) simplifies the extraction of finite state automata modeling an RNN's state transition dynamics, and (b) forces RNNs to operate more like automata with external memory and less like finite state machines.	3	116	4	0	29	5.862068965517241
01	The field of deep learning is commonly concerned with optimizing predictive models using large pre-acquired datasets of densely sampled datapoints or signals. In this work, we demonstrate that the deep learning paradigm can be extended to incorporate a subsampling scheme that is jointly optimized under a desired minimum sample rate. We present Deep Probabilistic Subsampling (DPS), a widely applicable framework for task-adaptive compressed sensing that enables end-to end optimization of an optimal subset of signal samples with a subsequent model that performs a required task. We demonstrate strong performance on reconstruction and classification tasks of a toy dataset, MNIST, and CIFAR10 under stringent subsampling rates in both the pixel and the spatial frequency domain. Due to the task-agnostic nature of the framework, DPS is directly applicable to all real-world domains that benefit from sample rate reduction.	7	136	0	0	0	5.8088235294117645
01	We present a new approach to assessing the robustness of neural networks based on estimating the proportion of inputs for which a property is violated. Specifically, we estimate the probability of the event that the property is violated under an input model. Our approach critically varies from the formal verification framework in that when the property can be violated, it provides an informative notion of how robust the network is, rather than just the conventional assertion that the network is not verifiable. Furthermore, it provides an ability to scale to larger networks than formal verification approaches. Though the framework still provides a formal guarantee of satisfiability whenever it successfully finds one or more violations, these advantages do come at the cost of only providing a statistical estimate of unsatisfiability whenever no violation is found. Key to the practical success of our approach is an adaptation of multi-level splitting, a Monte Carlo approach for estimating the probability of rare events, to our statistical robustness framework. We demonstrate that our approach is able to emulate formal verification procedures on benchmark problems, while scaling to larger networks and providing reliable additional information in the form of accurate estimates of the violation probability.	8	199	3	0	36	5.648241206030152
10	Model-based reinforcement learning methods typically learn models for high-dimensional state spaces by aiming to reconstruct and predict the original observations. However, drawing inspiration from model-free reinforcement learning, we propose learning a latent dynamics model directly from rewards. In this work, we introduce a model-based planning framework which learns a latent reward prediction model and then plan in the latent state-space. The latent representation is learned exclusively from multi-step reward prediction which we show to be the only necessary information for successful planning.  With this framework, we are able to benefit from the concise model-free representation, while still enjoying the data-efficiency of model-based algorithms.  We demonstrate our framework in multi-pendulum and multi-cheetah environments where several pendulums or cheetahs are shown to the agent but only one of them produces rewards. In these environments, it is important for the agent to construct a concise latent representation to filter out irrelevant observations. We find that our method can successfully learn an accurate latent reward prediction model in the presence of the irrelevant information while existing model-based methods fail. Planning in the learned latent state-space shows strong performance and high sample efficiency over model-free and model-based baselines.	9	193	3	0	16	6.202072538860104
01	A variety of cooperative multi-agent control problems require agents to achieve individual goals while contributing to collective success. This multi-goal multi-agent setting poses difficulties for recent algorithms, which primarily target settings with a single global reward, due to two new challenges: efficient exploration for learning both individual goal attainment and cooperation for others' success, and credit-assignment for interactions between actions and goals of different agents. To address both challenges, we restructure the problem into a novel two-stage curriculum, in which single-agent goal attainment is learned prior to learning multi-agent cooperation, and we derive a new multi-goal multi-agent policy gradient with a credit function for localized credit assignment. We use a function augmentation scheme to bridge value and policy functions across the curriculum. The complete architecture, called CM3, learns significantly faster than direct adaptations of existing algorithms on three challenging multi-goal multi-agent problems: cooperative navigation in difficult formations, negotiating multi-vehicle lane changes in the SUMO traffic simulator, and strategic cooperation in a Checkers environment.	7	163	1	0	23	6.539877300613497
10	This paper introduces a framework for solving combinatorial optimization problems by learning from input-output examples of optimization problems. We introduce a new memory augmented neural model in which the memory is not resettable (i.e the information stored in the memory after processing an input example is kept for the next seen examples). We used deep reinforcement learning to train a memory controller agent to store useful memories. Our model was able to outperform hand-crafted solver on Binary Linear Programming (Binary LP). The proposed model is tested on different Binary LP instances with large number of variables (up to 1000 variables) and constrains (up to 700 constrains).	8	106	3	0	20	5.547169811320754
10	Training generative adversarial networks requires balancing of delicate adversarial dynamics. Even with careful tuning, training may diverge or end up in a bad equilibrium with dropped modes. In this work, we introduce a new form of latent optimisation inspired by the CS-GAN and show that it improves adversarial dynamics by enhancing interactions between the discriminator and the generator. We develop supporting theoretical analysis from the perspectives of differentiable games and stochastic approximation. Our experiments demonstrate that latent optimisation can significantly improve GAN training, obtaining state-of-the-art performance for the ImageNet (128 x 128) dataset. Our model achieves an Inception Score (IS) of 148 and an Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 3.4, an improvement of 17% and 32% in IS and FID respectively, compared with the baseline BigGAN-deep model with the same architecture and number of parameters.	7	135	4	0	18	5.9407407407407415
10	Generative modeling of natural images has been extensively studied in recent years, yielding remarkable progress. Current state-of-the-art methods are either based on maximum likelihood estimation or adversarial training. Both methods have their own drawbacks, which are complementary in nature. The first leads to over-generalization as the maximum likelihood criterion encourages models to cover the support of the training data by heavily penalizing small masses assigned to training data. Simplifying assumptions in such models limits their capacity and makes them spill mass on unrealistic samples. The second leads to mode-dropping since adversarial training encourages high quality samples from the model, but only indirectly enforces diversity among the samples. To overcome these drawbacks we make two contributions. First, we propose a model that extends variational autoencoders by using deterministic invertible transformation layers to map samples from the decoder to the image space. This induces correlations among the pixels given the latent variables, improving over factorial decoders commonly used in variational autoencoders. Second, we propose a unified training approach that leverages coverage and quality based criteria. Our models obtain likelihood scores competitive with state-of-the-art likelihood-based models, while achieving sample quality typical of adversarially trained networks. 	9	192	7	0	13	6.364583333333332
10	This paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach for video features that results in significantly improved performance on downstream tasks (such as video classification, captioning and segmentation) compared to existing methods. Our method extends the BERT model for text sequences to the case of sequences of real-valued feature vectors, by replacing the softmax loss with noise contrastive estimation (NCE). We also show how to learn representations from sequences of visual features and sequences of words derived from ASR (automatic speech recognition), and show that such cross-modal training (when possible) helps even more.	7	91	3	0	11	6.010989010989013
10	The goal of this paper is to demonstrate a method for tensorizing neural networks based upon an efficient way of approximating scale invariant quantum states, the Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA). We employ MERA as a replacement for linear layers in a neural network and test this implementation on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The proposed method outperforms factorization using tensor trains, providing greater compression for the same level of accuracy and greater accuracy for the same level of compression. We demonstrate MERA-layers with 3900 times fewer parameters and a reduction in accuracy of less than 1% compared to the equivalent fully connected layers.	10	102	3	0	26	5.686274509803924
01	Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) have led to large improvements in the task of conditional image generation, which lies at the heart of computer vision. The major focus so far has been on performance improvement, while there has been little effort in making cGAN more robust to noise. The regression (of the generator) might lead to arbitrarily large errors in the output, which makes cGAN unreliable for real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a novel conditional GAN model, called RoCGAN, which leverages structure in the target space of the model to address the issue. Our model augments the generator with an unsupervised pathway, which promotes the outputs of the generator to span the target manifold even in the presence of intense noise. We prove that RoCGAN share similar theoretical properties as GAN and experimentally verify that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art cGAN architectures by a large margin in a variety of domains including images from natural scenes and faces.	5	160	4	0	34	5.43125
10	This work presents a method for active anomaly detection which can be built upon existing deep learning solutions for unsupervised anomaly detection. We show that a prior needs to be assumed on what the anomalies are, in order to have performance guarantees in unsupervised anomaly detection. We argue that active anomaly detection has, in practice, the same cost of unsupervised anomaly detection but with the possibility of much better results. To solve this problem, we present a new layer that can be attached to any deep learning model designed for unsupervised anomaly detection to transform it into an active method, presenting results on both synthetic and real anomaly detection datasets.	8	110	3	0	32	5.345454545454546
10	Deep generative models seek to recover the process with which the observed data was generated. They may be used to synthesize new samples or to subsequently extract representations. Successful approaches in the domain of images are driven by several core inductive biases. However, a bias to account for the compositional way in which humans structure a visual scene in terms of objects has frequently been overlooked. In this work we propose to structure the generator of a GAN to consider objects and their relations explicitly, and generate images by means of composition. This provides a way to efficiently learn a more accurate generative model of real-world images, and serves as an initial step towards learning corresponding object representations. We evaluate our approach on several multi-object image datasets, and find that the generator learns to identify and disentangle information corresponding to different objects at a representational level. A human study reveals that the resulting generative model is better at generating images that are more faithful to the reference distribution.	11	168	5	0	23	5.571428571428571
10	It is valuable yet remains challenging to apply neural networks in logical reasoning tasks. Despite some successes witnessed in learning SAT (Boolean Satisfiability) solvers for propositional logic via Graph Neural Networks (GNN),  there haven't been any successes in learning solvers for more complex predicate logic. In this paper, we target the QBF (Quantified Boolean Formula) satisfiability problem, the complexity of which is in-between propositional logic and predicate logic, and investigate the feasibility of learning GNN-based solvers and GNN-based heuristics for the cases with a universal-existential quantifier alternation (so-called 2QBF problems).We conjecture, with empirical support, that GNNs have certain limitations in learning 2QBF solvers, primarily due to the inability to reason about a set of assignments. Then we show the potential of GNN-based heuristics in CEGAR-based solvers and explore the interesting challenges to generalize them to larger problem instances. In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive surveying view of applying GNN-based embeddings to 2QBF problems and aims to offer insights in applying machine learning tools to more complicated symbolic reasoning problems.	8	171	3	0	8	6.116959064327485
10	There were many algorithms to substitute the back-propagation (BP) in the deep neural network (DNN) training. However, they could not become popular because their training accuracy and the computational efficiency were worse than BP. One of them was direct feedback alignment (DFA), but it showed low training performance especially for the convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, we overcome the limitation of the DFA algorithm by combining with the conventional BP during the CNN training. To improve the training stability, we also suggest the feedback weight initialization method by analyzing the patterns of the fixed random matrices in the DFA. Finally, we propose the new training algorithm, binary direct feedback alignment (BDFA) to minimize the computational cost while maintaining the training accuracy compared with the DFA. In our experiments, we use the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset to simulate the CNN learning from the scratch and apply the BDFA to the online learning based object tracking application to examine the training in the small dataset environment. Our proposed algorithms show better performance than conventional BP in both two different training tasks especially when the dataset is small.	9	187	3	0	0	5.6042780748663095

Concretely, our method produces a provable classifier which can establish statistical robustness against geometric perturbations (e.g., rotations, translations) as well as volume changes and pitch shifts on audio data. The generalization is non-trivial and requires careful handling of operations such as interpolation. Our method is agnostic to the choice of classifier and scales to modern architectures such as ResNet-50 on ImageNet.	8	79	4	0	15	6.189873417721517

We evaluate on static and dynamic configurations of MazeBase grid-worlds, with randomly generated environments of several different sizes, and on a StarCraft navigation scenario, with more complex dynamics, and pixels as input.	3	110	5	0	20	6.127272727272728
01	Bayesian phylogenetic inference is currently done via Markov chain Monte Carlo with simple mechanisms for proposing new states, which hinders exploration efficiency and often requires long runs to deliver accurate posterior estimates. In this paper we present an alternative approach: a variational framework for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. We approximate the true posterior using an expressive graphical model for tree distributions, called a subsplit Bayesian network, together with appropriate branch length distributions. We train the variational approximation via stochastic gradient ascent and adopt multi-sample based gradient estimators for different latent variables separately to handle the composite latent space of phylogenetic models. We show that our structured variational approximations are flexible enough to provide comparable posterior estimation to MCMC, while requiring less computation due to a more efficient tree exploration mechanism enabled by variational inference. Moreover, the variational approximations can be readily used for further statistical analysis such as marginal likelihood estimation for model comparison via importance sampling. Experiments on both synthetic data and real data Bayesian phylogenetic inference problems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.	4	176	3	0	20	6.5397727272727275
10	For semantic image segmentation and lane detection, nets with a single spatial pyramid structure or encoder-decoder structure are usually exploited. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show great results on both high-level and low-level features representations, however, the capability has not been fully embodied for lane detection task. In especial, it's still a challenge for model-based lane detection to combine the multi-scale context with a pixel-level accuracy because of the weak visual appearance and strong prior information. In this paper, we we propose an novel network for lane detection, the three main contributions are as follows. First, we employ multiple encoder-decoders module in end-to-end ways and show the promising results for lane detection. Second, we analysis different configurations of multiple encoder-decoders nets. Third, we make our attempts to rethink the evaluation methods of lane detection for the limitation of the popular methods based on IoU.	6	143	0	0	0	5.895104895104895
10	Large pretrained language models have changed the way researchers approach discriminative natural language understanding tasks, leading to the dominance of approaches that adapt a pretrained model for arbitrary downstream tasks. However, it is an open question how to use similar techniques for language generation. Early results in the encoder-agnostic setting have been mostly negative. In this work, we explore methods for adapting a pretrained language model to arbitrary conditional input. We observe that pretrained transformer models are sensitive to large parameter changes during tuning. Therefore, we propose an adaptation that directly injects arbitrary conditioning into self attention, an approach we call pseudo self attention. Through experiments on four diverse conditional text generation tasks, we show that this encoder-agnostic technique outperforms strong baselines, produces coherent generations, and is data-efficient.	6	128	3	1	0	6.359375
10	"Feedforward convolutional neural network has achieved a great success in many computer vision tasks. While it validly imitates the hierarchical structure of biological visual system, it still lacks one essential architectural feature: contextual recurrent connections with feedback, which widely exists in biological visual system. In this work, we designed a Contextual Recurrent Convolutional Network with this feature embedded in a standard CNN structure. We found that such feedback connections could enable lower layers to ``rethink"" about their representations given the top-down contextual information. We carefully studied the components of this network, and showed its robustness and superiority over feedforward baselines in such tasks as noise image classification, partially occluded object recognition and fine-grained image classification. We believed this work could be an important step to help bridge the gap between computer vision models and real biological visual system."	8	138	3	0	14	6.1884057971014474
10	 {\em Saliency methods} attempt to explain a deep net's decision by assigning a {\em score} to each feature/pixel in the input, often doing this credit-assignment via the gradient of the output with respect to input. Recently \citet{adebayosan} questioned the validity of many of these methods since they do not pass simple {\em sanity checks}, which test whether the scores shift/vanish when  layers of the trained net are randomized, or when the net is retrained using random labels for inputs. % for the inputs.   %Surprisingly, the tested methods did not pass these checks: the explanations were relatively unchanged. We propose a simple fix to existing saliency methods that helps them pass sanity checks, which we call {\em competition for pixels}. This involves computing saliency maps for all possible labels in the classification task, and using a simple competition among them to identify and remove less relevant pixels from the map. Some theoretical justification is provided for it  and its performance is empirically demonstrated on several popular methods.	12	166	4	0	19	5.427710843373494
10	Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has been proposed as an alternative to Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) in order to account for potential biases in the training data distribution. However, its use in deep learning has been severely restricted due to the relative inefficiency of the optimizers available for DRO compared to the wide-spread Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) based optimizers for deep learning with ERM. In this work, we demonstrate that SGD with hardness weighted sampling is a principled and efficient optimization method for DRO in machine learning and is particularly suited in the context of deep learning. Similar to a hard example mining strategy in essence and in practice, the proposed algorithm is straightforward to implement and computationally as efficient as SGD-based optimizers used for deep learning.  It only requires adding a softmax layer and maintaining an history of the loss values for each training example to compute adaptive sampling probabilities.  In contrast to typical ad hoc hard mining approaches, and exploiting recent theoretical results in deep learning optimization, we prove the convergence of our DRO algorithm for over-parameterized deep learning networks with ReLU activation and finite  number  of  layers  and parameters.  Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of our approach.	10	201	6	0	12	5.791044776119403
10	We address the problem of learning fine-grained cross-modal representations. We propose an instance-based deep metric learning approach in joint visual and textual space. The key novelty of this paper is that it shows that using per-image semantic supervision leads to substantial improvement in zero-shot performance over using class-only supervision. On top of that, we provide a probabilistic justification for a metric rescaling approach that solves a very common problem in the generalized zero-shot learning setting, i.e., classifying test images from unseen classes as one of the classes seen during training. We evaluate our approach on two fine-grained zero-shot learning datasets: CUB and FLOWERS. We find that on the generalized zero-shot classification task CLAREL consistently outperforms the existing approaches on both datasets.	8	121	3	0	31	5.975206611570248
10	Despite the rapid development of adversarial attacks for machine learning models, many types of new adversarial examples still remain unknown.  Uncovered types of adversarial attacks pose serious concern for the safety of the models,  which raise the question about the effectiveness of current adversarial robustness evaluation. Semantic segmentation is one of the most impactful applications of machine learning;  however, their robustness under adversarial attack is not well studied. In this paper,  we focus on generating unrestricted adversarial examples for semantic segmentation models.  We demonstrate a simple yet effective method to generate unrestricted adversarial examples using conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN) without any hand-crafted metric. The naive implementation of CGAN, however, yields inferior image quality and low attack success rate. Instead, we leverage the SPADE (Spatially-adaptive denormalization) structure with an additional loss item, which is able to generate effective adversarial attacks in a single step.   We validate our approach on the well studied Cityscapes andADE20K datasets,  and demonstrate that our synthetic adversarial examples are not only realistic, but also improves the attack success rate by up to 41.0% compared with the state of the art adversarial attack methods including PGD attack.	6	190	3	0	0	6.121052631578947
01	Neural networks can approximate complex functions, but they struggle to perform exact arithmetic operations over real numbers. The lack of inductive bias for arithmetic operations leaves neural networks without the underlying logic necessary to extrapolate on tasks such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. We present two new neural network components: the Neural Addition Unit (NAU), which can learn exact addition and subtraction; and the Neural Multiplication Unit (NMU) that can multiply subsets of a vector. The NMU is, to our knowledge, the first arithmetic neural network component that can learn to multiply elements from a vector, when the hidden size is large. The two new components draw inspiration from a theoretical analysis of recently proposed arithmetic components. We find that careful initialization, restricting parameter space, and regularizing for sparsity is important when optimizing the NAU and NMU. Our proposed units NAU and NMU, compared with previous neural units, converge more consistently, have fewer parameters, learn faster, can converge for larger hidden sizes, obtain sparse and meaningful weights, and can extrapolate to negative and small values.	3	175	0	1	0	5.828571428571428
10	Autonomous vehicles are becoming more common in city transportation.  Companies will begin to find a need to teach these vehicles smart city fleet coordination.  Currently, simulation based modeling along with hand coded rules dictate the decision making of these autonomous vehicles. We believe that complex intelligent behavior can be learned by these agents through Reinforcement Learning.In this paper, we discuss our work for solving this system by adapting the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) model to the multi-agent setting.  Our approach applies deep reinforcement learning by combining convolutional neural networks with DQN to teach agents to fulfill customer demand in an environment that is partially observ-able to them. We also demonstrate how to utilize transfer learning to teach agents to balance multiple objectives such as navigating to a charging station when its en-ergy level is low. The two evaluations presented show that our solution has shown  hat we are successfully able to teach agents cooperation policies while balancing multiple objectives.	8	158	2	0	11	5.70886075949367
01	Adversarial patch attacks are among one of the most practical threat models against real-world computer vision systems. This paper studies certified and empirical defenses against patch attacks. We begin with a set of experiments showing that most existing defenses, which work by pre-processing input images to mitigate adversarial patches, are easily broken by simple white-box adversaries. Motivated by this finding, we propose the first certified defense against patch attacks, and propose faster methods for its training. Furthermore, we experiment with different patch shapes for testing, obtaining surprisingly good robustness transfer across shapes, and present preliminary results on certified defense against sparse attacks. Our complete implementation can be found on: https://github.com/Ping-C/certifiedpatchdefense.	5	110	4	1	0	6.536363636363636
10	We introduce a new method for training GANs by applying the Wasserstein-2 metric proximal on the generators. The approach is based on the gradient operator induced by optimal transport, which connects the geometry of sample space and parameter space in implicit deep generative models. From this theory, we obtain an easy-to-implement regularizer for the parameter updates. Our experiments demonstrate that this method improves the speed and stability in training GANs in terms of wall-clock time and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) learning curves. 	4	82	4	0	9	5.743902439024391
10	This paper proposes Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder (DirVAE) using a Dirichlet prior for a continuous latent variable that exhibits the characteristic of the categorical probabilities. To infer the parameters of DirVAE, we utilize the stochastic gradient method by approximating the Gamma distribution, which is a component of the Dirichlet distribution, with the inverse Gamma CDF approximation. Additionally, we reshape the component collapsing issue by investigating two problem sources, which are decoder weight collapsing and latent value collapsing, and we show that DirVAE has no component collapsing; while Gaussian VAE exhibits the decoder weight collapsing and Stick-Breaking VAE shows the latent value collapsing. The experimental results show that 1) DirVAE models the latent representation result with the best log-likelihood compared to the baselines; and 2) DirVAE produces more interpretable latent values with no collapsing issues which the baseline models suffer from. Also, we show that the learned latent representation from the DirVAE achieves the best classification accuracy in the semi-supervised and the supervised classification tasks on MNIST, OMNIGLOT, and SVHN compared to the baseline VAEs. Finally, we demonstrated that the DirVAE augmented topic models show better performances in most cases.	3	188	4	0	0	6.058510638297872
01	Despite their ability to memorize large datasets, deep neural networks often achieve good generalization performance. However, the differences between the learned solutions of networks which generalize and those which do not remain unclear. Additionally, the tuning properties of single directions (defined as the activation of a single unit or some linear combination of units in response to some input) have been highlighted, but their importance has not been evaluated. Here, we connect these lines of inquiry to demonstrate that a network’s reliance on single directions is a good predictor of its generalization performance, across networks trained on datasets with different fractions of corrupted labels, across ensembles of networks trained on datasets with unmodified labels, across different hyper- parameters, and over the course of training. While dropout only regularizes this quantity up to a point, batch normalization implicitly discourages single direction reliance, in part by decreasing the class selectivity of individual units. Finally, we find that class selectivity is a poor predictor of task importance, suggesting not only that networks which generalize well minimize their dependence on individual units by reducing their selectivity, but also that individually selective units may not be necessary for strong network performance.	8	196	4	0	37	5.928571428571429
10	Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) is able to accelerate the acquisition of new tasks by learning from past experience. Current meta-RL methods usually learn to adapt to new tasks by directly optimizing the parameters of policies over primitive actions. However, for complex tasks which requires sophisticated control strategies, it would be quite inefficient to to directly learn such a meta-policy. Moreover, this problem can become more severe and even fail in spare reward settings, which is quite common in practice. To this end, we propose a new meta-RL algorithm called meta goal-generation for hierarchical RL (MGHRL) by leveraging hierarchical actor-critic framework. Instead of directly generate policies over primitive actions for new tasks, MGHRL learns to generate high-level meta strategies over subgoals given past experience and leaves the rest of how to achieve subgoals as independent RL subtasks. Our empirical results on several challenging simulated robotics environments show that our method enables more efficient and effective meta-learning from past experience and outperforms state-of-the-art meta-RL and Hierarchical-RL methods in sparse reward settings.	8	169	0	0	0	6.0118343195266295
10	Neural text generation models such as recurrent networks are typically trained by maximizing data log-likelihood based on cross entropy. Such training objective shows a discrepancy from test criteria like the BLEU metric. Recent work optimizes expected BLEU under the model distribution using policy gradient, while such algorithm can suffer from high variance and become impractical. In this paper, we propose a new Differentiable Expected BLEU (DEBLEU) objective that permits direct optimization of neural generation models with gradient descent. We leverage the decomposability and sparsity of BLEU, and reformulate it with moderate approximations, making the evaluation of the objective and its gradient efficient, comparable to common cross-entropy loss. We further devise a simple training procedure with ground-truth masking and annealing for stable optimization. Experiments on neural machine translation and image captioning show our method significantly improves over both cross-entropy and policy gradient training.	6	142	7	0	18	6.232394366197183
01	Deep residual networks (ResNets) and their variants are widely used in many computer vision applications and natural language processing tasks.  However, the theoretical principles for designing and training ResNets are still not fully understood. Recently, several points of view have emerged to try to interpret ResNet theoretically, such as unraveled view, unrolled iterative estimation and dynamical systems view. In this paper, we adopt the dynamical systems point of view, and analyze the lesioning properties of ResNet both theoretically and experimentally.  Based on these analyses, we additionally propose a novel method for accelerating ResNet training. We apply the proposed method to train ResNets and Wide ResNets for three image classification benchmarks, reducing training time by more than 40\% with superior or on-par accuracy.	7	122	2	0	0	5.909836065573771
01	The current dominant paradigm for imitation learning relies on strong supervision of expert actions to learn both 'what' and 'how' to imitate. We pursue an alternative paradigm wherein an agent first explores the world without any expert supervision and then distills its experience into a goal-conditioned skill policy with a novel forward consistency loss. In our framework, the role of the expert is only to communicate the goals (i.e., what to imitate) during inference. The learned policy is then employed to mimic the expert (i.e., how to imitate) after seeing just a sequence of images demonstrating the desired task. Our method is 'zero-shot' in the sense that the agent never has access to expert actions during training or for the task demonstration at inference. We evaluate our zero-shot imitator in two real-world settings: complex rope manipulation with a Baxter robot and navigation in previously unseen office environments with a TurtleBot. Through further experiments in VizDoom simulation, we provide evidence that better mechanisms for exploration lead to learning a more capable policy which in turn improves end task performance. Videos, models, and more details are available at https://pathak22.github.io/zeroshot-imitation/.	3	187	9	0	27	5.679144385026738

The Scratchpad encoder enables the decoder at each time step to modify all the encoder outputs, thus using the encoder as a ""scratchpad"" memory to keep track of what has been generated so far and to guide future generation. Experiments on a knowledge based question generation dataset show that our approach generates more fluent and expressive questions according to quantitative metrics and human judgments."	6	96	4	0	32	5.5
01	Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has been proven to be a powerful, general tool for learning complex behaviors. However, its sample efficiency is often impractically large for solving challenging real-world problems, even for off-policy algorithms such as Q-learning. A limiting factor in classic model-free RL is that the learning signal consists only of scalar rewards, ignoring much of the rich information contained in state transition tuples. Model-based RL uses this information, by training a predictive model, but often does not achieve the same asymptotic performance as model-free RL due to model bias. We introduce temporal difference models (TDMs), a family of goal-conditioned value functions that can be trained with model-free learning and used for model-based control. TDMs combine the benefits of model-free and model-based RL: they leverage the rich information in state transitions to learn very efficiently, while still attaining asymptotic performance that exceeds that of direct model-based RL methods. Our experimental results show that, on a range of continuous control tasks, TDMs provide a substantial improvement in efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-based and model-free methods.	9	175	10	0	27	6.0
10	Being able to predict what may happen in the future requires an in-depth understanding of the physical and causal rules that govern the world. A model that is able to do so has a number of appealing applications, from robotic planning to representation learning. However, learning to predict raw future observations, such as frames in a video, is exceedingly challenging—the ambiguous nature of the problem can cause a naively designed model to average together possible futures into a single, blurry prediction. Recently, this has been addressed by two distinct approaches: (a) latent variational variable models that explicitly model underlying stochasticity and (b) adversarially-trained models that aim to produce naturalistic images. However, a standard latent variable model can struggle to produce realistic results, and a standard adversarially-trained model underutilizes latent variables and fails to produce diverse predictions. We show that these distinct methods are in fact complementary. Combining the two produces predictions that look more realistic to human raters and better cover the range of possible futures. Our method outperforms prior works in these aspects.	4	174	3	0	0	5.804597701149424
01	We propose a novel framework, called Disjoint Mapping Network (DIMNet), for cross-modal biometric matching, in particular of voices and faces. Different from the existing methods, DIMNet does not explicitly learn the joint relationship between the modalities. Instead, DIMNet learns a shared representation for different modalities by mapping them individually to their common covariates. These shared representations can then be used to find the correspondences between the modalities. We show empirically that DIMNet is able to achieve better performance than the current state-of-the-art methods, with the additional benefits of being conceptually simpler and less data-intensive.	10	94	3	0	0	6.2765957446808525
10	We present a systematic framework for the Nesterov's accelerated gradient flows in the spaces of probabilities embedded with information metrics. Here two metrics are considered, including both the Fisher-Rao metric and the Wasserstein-$2$ metric. For the Wasserstein-$2$ metric case, we prove the convergence properties of the accelerated gradient flows, and introduce their formulations in Gaussian families. Furthermore, we propose a practical discrete-time algorithm in particle implementations with an adaptive restart technique.  We formulate a novel bandwidth selection method, which learns the Wasserstein-$2$ gradient direction from Brownian-motion samples. Experimental results including Bayesian inference show the strength of the current method compared with the state-of-the-art.	4	103	3	1	10	6.6893203883495165
10	Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). State-of-the-art RL algorithms suffer from high sample complexity, particularly in the sparse reward case, where they can do no better than to explore in all directions until the first positive rewards are found. To mitigate this, we propose Rapidly Randomly-exploring Reinforcement Learning (R3L). We formulate exploration as a search problem and leverage widely-used planning algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) to find initial solutions. These solutions are used as demonstrations to initialize a policy, then refined by a generic RL algorithm, leading to faster and more stable convergence. We provide theoretical guarantees of R3L exploration finding successful solutions, as well as bounds for its sampling complexity. We experimentally demonstrate the method outperforms classic and intrinsic exploration techniques, requiring only a fraction of exploration samples and achieving better asymptotic performance.	6	142	4	0	7	6.267605633802817
10	Recent advances have made it possible to create deep complex-valued neural networks. Despite this progress, the potential power of fully complex intermediate computations and representations has not yet been explored for many challenging learning problems. Building on recent advances, we propose a novel mechanism for extracting signals in the frequency domain. As a case study, we perform audio source separation in the Fourier domain. Our extraction mechanism could be regarded as a local ensembling method that combines a complex-valued convolutional version of Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) and a signal averaging operation. We also introduce a new explicit amplitude and phase-aware loss, which is scale and time invariant, taking into account the complex-valued components of the spectrogram. Using the Wall Street Journal Dataset, we compare our phase-aware loss to several others that operate both in the time and frequency domains and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed signal extraction method and proposed loss. When operating in the complex-valued frequency domain, our deep complex-valued network substantially outperforms its real-valued counterparts even with half the depth and a third of the parameters. Our proposed mechanism improves significantly deep complex-valued networks' performance and we demonstrate the usefulness of its regularizing effect.	10	197	2	1	8	6.060913705583756
01	Deep convolutional neural networks are now widely deployed in vision applications, but a limited size of training data can restrict their task performance. Transfer learning offers the chance for CNNs to learn with limited data samples by transferring knowledge from models pretrained on large datasets. Blindly transferring all learned features from the source dataset, however, brings unnecessary computation to CNNs on the target task. In this paper, we propose attentive feature distillation and selection (AFDS), which not only adjusts the strength of transfer learning regularization but also dynamically determines the important features to transfer. By deploying AFDS on ResNet-101, we achieved a state-of-the-art computation reduction at the same accuracy budget, outperforming all existing transfer learning methods. With a 10x MACs reduction budget, a ResNet-101 equipped with AFDS transfer learned from ImageNet to Stanford Dogs 120, can achieve an accuracy 11.07% higher than its best competitor.	8	145	3	0	17	5.965517241379311

10	This work presents a scalable solution to continuous visual speech recognition. To achieve this, we constructed the largest existing visual speech recognition dataset, consisting of pairs of text and video clips of faces speaking (3,886 hours of video). In tandem, we designed and trained an integrated lipreading system, consisting of a video processing pipeline that maps raw video to stable videos of lips and sequences of phonemes, a scalable deep neural network that maps the lip videos to sequences of phoneme distributions, and a production-level speech decoder that outputs sequences of words. The proposed system achieves a word error rate (WER) of 40.9% as measured on a held-out set. In comparison, professional lipreaders achieve either 86.4% or 92.9% WER on the same dataset when having access to additional types of contextual information. Our approach significantly improves on previous lipreading approaches, including variants of LipNet and of Watch, Attend, and Spell (WAS), which are only capable of 89.8% and 76.8% WER respectively.	4	161	3	0	11	5.540372670807455
01	The driving force behind deep networks is their ability to compactly represent rich classes of functions. The primary notion for formally reasoning about this phenomenon is expressive efficiency, which refers to a situation where one network must grow unfeasibly large in order to replicate functions of another. To date, expressive efficiency analyses focused on the architectural feature of depth, showing that deep networks are representationally superior to shallow ones. In this paper we study the expressive efficiency brought forth by connectivity, motivated by the observation that modern networks interconnect their layers in elaborate ways. We focus on dilated convolutional networks, a family of deep models delivering state of the art performance in sequence processing tasks. By introducing and analyzing the concept of mixed tensor decompositions, we prove that interconnecting dilated convolutional networks can lead to expressive efficiency. In particular, we show that even a single connection between intermediate layers can already lead to an almost quadratic gap, which in large-scale settings typically makes the difference between a model that is practical and one that is not. Empirical evaluation demonstrates how the expressive efficiency of connectivity, similarly to that of depth, translates into gains in accuracy. This leads us to believe that expressive efficiency may serve a key role in developing new tools for deep network design.	8	216	4	0	22	5.787037037037037
10	Evolutionary-based optimization approaches have recently shown promising results in domains such as Atari and robot locomotion but less so in solving 3D tasks directly from pixels. This paper presents a method called Deep Innovation Protection (DIP) that allows training  complex world models end-to-end for such 3D environments. The main idea behind the approach is to employ multiobjective optimization to temporally reduce the selection pressure on specific components in a world model, allowing other components to adapt. We investigate the emergent representations of these evolved networks, which learn a model of the world without the need for a specific forward-prediction loss. 	3	100	4	0	12	5.86
01	Neural networks trained only to optimize for training accuracy can often be fooled by adversarial examples --- slightly perturbed inputs misclassified with high confidence. Verification of networks enables us to gauge their vulnerability to such adversarial examples. We formulate verification of piecewise-linear neural networks as a mixed integer program. On a representative task of finding minimum adversarial distortions, our verifier is two to three orders of magnitude quicker than the state-of-the-art. We achieve this computational speedup via tight formulations for non-linearities, as well as a novel presolve algorithm that makes full use of all information available. The computational speedup allows us to verify properties on convolutional and residual networks with over 100,000 ReLUs --- several orders of magnitude more than networks previously verified by any complete verifier. In particular, we determine for the first time the exact adversarial accuracy of an MNIST classifier to perturbations with bounded l-∞ norm ε=0.1: for this classifier, we find an adversarial example for 4.38% of samples, and a certificate of robustness to norm-bounded perturbations for the remainder. Across all robust training procedures and network architectures considered, and for both the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we are able to certify more samples than the state-of-the-art and find more adversarial examples than a strong first-order attack.	9	210	4	0	29	5.919047619047619
10	We explore the idea of compositional set embeddings that can be used to infer notjust a single class, but the set of classes associated with the input data (e.g., image,video, audio signal). This can be useful, for example, in multi-object detection inimages, or multi-speaker diarization (one-shot learning) in audio. In particular, wedevise and implement two novel models consisting of (1) an embedding functionf trained jointly with a “composite” function g that computes set union opera-tions between the classes encoded in two embedding vectors; and (2) embeddingf trained jointly with a “query” function h that computes whether the classes en-coded in one embedding subsume the classes encoded in another embedding. Incontrast to prior work, these models must both perceive the classes associatedwith the input examples, and also encode the relationships between different classlabel sets. In experiments conducted on simulated data, OmniGlot, and COCOdatasets, the proposed composite embedding models outperform baselines basedon traditional embedding approaches.	10	166	3	1	33	5.530120481927709
01	This paper addresses the problem of incremental domain adaptation (IDA) in natural language processing (NLP). We assume each domain comes one after another, and that we could only access data in the current domain. The goal of IDA is  to build a unified model performing well on all the domains that we have encountered. We adopt the recurrent neural network (RNN) widely used in NLP, but augment it with a directly parameterized memory bank, which is retrieved by an attention mechanism at each step of RNN transition. The memory bank provides a natural way of IDA: when adapting our model to a new domain, we progressively add new slots to the memory bank, which increases the number of parameters, and thus the model capacity. We learn the new memory slots and fine-tune existing parameters by back-propagation. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly better performance than fine-tuning alone. Compared with expanding hidden states, our approach is more robust for old domains, shown by both empirical and theoretical results. Our model also outperforms previous work of IDA including elastic weight consolidation and progressive neural networks in the experiments.	7	188	2	1	16	5.361702127659576
10	Recent work has demonstrated the lack of robustness of well-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples.  For example, visually indistinguishable perturbations, when mixed with an original image, can easily lead deep learning models to misclassifications.  In light of a recent study on the mutual influence between robustness and accuracy over 18 different ImageNet models, this paper investigates how training data affect the accuracy and robustness of deep neuralnetworks. We conduct extensive experiments on four different datasets, including CIFAR-10, MNIST, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet, with several representative neural networks. Our results reveal previously unknown phenomena that exist between the size of training data and characteristics of the resulting models. In particular, besides confirming that the model accuracy improves as the amount of training data increases, we also observe that the model robustness improves initially, but there exists a turning point after which robustness starts to decrease.  How and when such turning points occur vary for different neural networks and different datasets.	14	162	4	0	0	6.0
10	The problem of explaining deep learning models, and model predictions generally, has attracted intensive interest recently. Many successful approaches forgo global approximations in order to provide more faithful local interpretations of the model’s behavior. LIME develops multiple  interpretable models, each approximating a large neural network on a small region of the data manifold, and SP-LIME aggregates the local models to form a global interpretation.  Extending this line of research, we propose a simple yet effective method, NormLIME, for aggregating local models into global and class-specific interpretations.  A human user study strongly favored the class-specific interpretations created by NormLIME to other feature importance metrics. Numerical experiments employing Keep And Retrain (KAR) based feature ablation across various baselines (Random, Gradient-based, LIME, SHAP) confirms NormLIME’s effectiveness for recognizing important features.	11	127	5	0	33	6.559055118110236
10	Detecting anomalies is of growing importance for various industrial applications and mission-critical infrastructures, including satellite systems. Although there have been several studies in detecting anomalies based on rule-based or machine learning-based approaches for satellite systems, a tensor-based decomposition method has not been extensively explored for anomaly detection. In this work, we introduce an Integrative Tensor-based Anomaly Detection (ITAD) framework to detect anomalies in a satellite system. Because of the high risk and cost, detecting anomalies in a satellite system is crucial. We construct 3rd-order tensors with telemetry data collected from Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2 (KOMPSAT-2) and calculate the anomaly score using one of the component matrices obtained by applying CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition to detect anomalies. Our result shows that our tensor-based approach can be effective in achieving higher accuracy and reducing false positives in detecting anomalies as compared to other existing approaches.	7	140	2	0	9	6.4785714285714295

In this paper, we provide precise conditions under which data augmentation hurts test accuracy for minimum norm estimators in linear regression. To mitigate the failure modes of augmentation, we introduce X-regularization, which uses unlabeled data to regularize the parameters towards the non-augmented estimate. We prove that our new estimator never hurts test error and exhibits significant improvements over adversarial data augmentation on CIFAR-10.	12	94	4	0	0	6.148936170212767
01	Owing to their connection with generative adversarial networks (GANs), saddle-point problems have recently attracted considerable interest in machine learning and beyond. By necessity, most theoretical guarantees revolve around convex-concave (or even linear) problems; however, making theoretical inroads towards efficient GAN training depends crucially on moving beyond this classic framework. To make piecemeal progress along these lines, we analyze the behavior of mirror descent (MD) in a class of non-monotone problems whose solutions coincide with those of a naturally associated variational inequality – a property which we call coherence. We first show that ordinary, “vanilla” MD converges under a strict version of this condition, but not otherwise; in particular, it may fail to converge even in bilinear models with a unique solution. We then show that this deficiency is mitigated by optimism: by taking an “extra-gradient” step, optimistic mirror descent (OMD) converges in all coherent problems. Our analysis generalizes and extends the results of Daskalakis et al. [2018] for optimistic gradient descent (OGD) in bilinear problems, and makes concrete headway for provable convergence beyond convex-concave games. We also provide stochastic analogues of these results, and we validate our analysis by numerical experiments in a wide array of GAN models (including Gaussian mixture models, and the CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets).	11	208	4	0	23	5.9423076923076925
01	"Chemical reactions can be described as the stepwise redistribution of electrons in molecules. As such, reactions are often depicted using ""arrow-pushing"" diagrams which show this movement as a sequence of arrows. We propose an electron path prediction model (ELECTRO) to learn these sequences directly from raw reaction data. Instead of predicting product molecules directly from reactant molecules in one shot, learning a model of electron movement has the benefits of (a) being easy for chemists to interpret, (b) incorporating constraints of chemistry, such as balanced atom counts before and after the reaction, and (c) naturally encoding the sparsity of chemical reactions, which usually involve changes in only a small number of atoms in the reactants. We design a method to extract approximate reaction paths from any dataset of atom-mapped reaction SMILES strings. Our model achieves excellent performance on an important subset of the USPTO reaction dataset, comparing favorably to the strongest baselines. Furthermore, we show that our model recovers a basic knowledge of chemistry without being explicitly trained to do so."	6	171	4	0	20	5.637426900584796
10	While deep neural networks have achieved groundbreaking prediction results in many tasks, there is a class of data where existing architectures are not optimal -- sequences of probability distributions. Performing forward prediction on sequences of distributions has many important applications. However, there are two main challenges in designing a network model for this task. First, neural networks are unable to encode distributions compactly as each node encodes just a real value. A recent work of Distribution Regression Network (DRN) solved this problem with a novel network that encodes an entire distribution in a single node, resulting in improved accuracies while using much fewer parameters than neural networks. However, despite its compact distribution representation, DRN does not address the second challenge, which is the need to model time dependencies in a sequence of distributions. In this paper, we propose our Recurrent Distribution Regression Network (RDRN) which adopts a recurrent architecture for DRN. The combination of compact distribution representation and shared weights architecture across time steps makes RDRN suitable for modeling the time dependencies in a distribution sequence. Compared to neural networks and DRN, RDRN achieves the best prediction performance while keeping the network compact.	7	193	3	0	13	5.922279792746114
10	We present a neural network architecture based upon the Autoencoder (AE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that promotes a convex latent distribution by training adversarially on latent space interpolations. By using an AE as both the generator and discriminator of a GAN, we pass a pixel-wise error function across the discriminator, yielding an AE which produces sharp samples that match both high- and low-level features of the original images. Samples generated from interpolations between data in latent space remain within the distribution of real data as trained by the discriminator, and therefore preserve realistic resemblances to the network inputs.	14	99	7	0	27	5.7474747474747465
10	We study the problem of learning permutation invariant representations that can capture containment relations. We propose training a model on a novel task: predicting the size of the symmetric difference between pairs of multisets, sets which may contain multiple copies of the same object. With motivation from fuzzy set theory, we formulate both multiset representations and how to predict symmetric difference sizes given these representations. We model multiset elements as vectors on the standard simplex and multisets as the summations of such vectors, and we predict symmetric difference as the l1-distance between multiset representations. We demonstrate that our representations more effectively predict the sizes of symmetric differences than DeepSets-based approaches with unconstrained object representations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model learns meaningful representations, mapping objects of different classes to different standard basis vectors.	4	133	7	1	29	6.3233082706766925
10	It has been repeatedly observed that convolutional architectures when applied toimage understanding tasks learn oriented bandpass filters. A standard explanationof this result is that these filters reflect the structure of the images that they havebeen exposed to during training: Natural images typically are locally composedof oriented contours at various scales and oriented bandpass filters are matchedto such structure. The present paper offers an alternative explanation based noton the structure of images, but rather on the structure of convolutional architectures.In particular, complex exponentials are the eigenfunctions of convolution.These eigenfunctions are defined globally; however, convolutional architecturesoperate locally. To enforce locality, one can apply a windowing function to theeigenfunctions, which leads to oriented bandpass filters as the natural operatorsto be learned with convolutional architectures. From a representational point ofview, these filters allow for a local systematic way to characterize and operate onan image or other signal.	9	156	4	0	18	5.9743589743589745
01	Recent work has demonstrated that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., inputs that are almost indistinguishable from natural data and yet classified incorrectly by the network. To address this problem, we study the adversarial robustness of neural networks through the lens of robust optimization. This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on much prior work on this topic. Its principled nature also enables us to identify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are reliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a concrete security guarantee that would protect against a well-defined class of adversaries. These methods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide range of adversarial attacks. They also suggest robustness against a first-order adversary as a natural security guarantee. We believe that robustness against such well-defined classes of adversaries is an important stepping stone towards fully resistant deep learning models.	8	156	3	0	28	5.782051282051282
10	Triplet loss is commonly used in descriptor learning, where the performance heavily relies on mining triplets. Typical solution to that is first picking pairs of intra-class patches (positives) from the dataset to form batches, and then selecting in-batch negatives to construct triplets. For high-informativeness triplet collection, researchers mainly focus on mining hard negatives in the second stage, while they pay relatively less attention to constructing informative  batches, i.e., matching pairs are often randomly sampled from the dataset. To address this issue, we propose AdaSample, an adaptive and online batch sampler, in this paper. Specifically, we sample positives based on their informativeness, and formulate our hardness-aware positive mining pipeline within a novel maximum loss minimization training protocol. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated in several standard benchmarks, in which it results in a significant and consistent performance gain on top of the existing strong baselines. The source code and pretrained model will be released upon acceptance.	9	157	2	0	0	5.980891719745222
10	This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model for clustering sparse sequences.This is a mixture model and does not need the data to be represented by a Gaussian mixture and that gives significant modelling freedom.It also generates a very interpretable profile for the discovered latent groups.The data that was used for the work have been contributed by a restaurant loyalty program company. The data is a collection of sparse sequences where each entry of each sequence is the number of user visits of one week to some restaurant. This algorithm successfully clustered the data and calculated the expected user affiliation in each cluster.	13	102	4	0	14	5.333333333333333
01	In contrast to fully connected networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve efficiency by learning weights associated with local filters with a finite spatial extent. An implication of this is that a filter may know what it is looking at, but not where it is positioned in the image. Information concerning absolute position is inherently useful, and it is reasonable to assume that deep CNNs may implicitly learn to encode this information if there is a means to do so. In this paper, we test this hypothesis revealing the surprising degree of absolute position information that is encoded in commonly used neural networks. A comprehensive set of experiments show the validity of this hypothesis and shed light on how and where this information is represented while offering clues to where positional information is derived from in deep CNNs.	9	137	2	0	24	5.233576642335766
10	Turing complete computation and reasoning are often regarded as necessary pre- cursors to general intelligence. There has been a significant body of work studying neural networks that mimic general computation, but these networks fail to generalize to data distributions that are outside of their training set. We study this problem through the lens of fundamental computer science problems: sorting and graph processing. We modify the masking mechanism of a transformer in order to allow them to implement rudimentary functions with strong generalization. We call this model the Neural Execution Engine, and show that it learns, through supervision, to numerically compute the basic subroutines comprising these algorithms with near perfect accuracy. Moreover, it retains this level of accuracy while generalizing to unseen data and long sequences outside of the training distribution.	3	130	3	0	25	5.823076923076923
01	We present a new algorithm to train a robust neural network against adversarial attacks. Our algorithm is motivated by the following two ideas. First, although recent work has demonstrated that fusing randomness can improve the robustness of neural networks (Liu 2017), we noticed that adding noise blindly to all the layers is not the optimal way to incorporate randomness. Instead, we model randomness under the framework of Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to formally learn the posterior distribution of models in a scalable way. Second, we formulate the mini-max problem in BNN to learn the best model distribution under adversarial attacks, leading to an adversarial-trained Bayesian neural net. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance under strong attacks. On CIFAR-10 with VGG network, our model leads to 14% accuracy improvement compared with adversarial training (Madry 2017) and random self-ensemble (Liu, 2017) under PGD attack with 0.035 distortion, and the gap becomes even larger on a subset of ImageNet.	9	160	0	0	19	5.7125
01	In many applications labeled data is not readily available, and needs to be collected via pain-staking human supervision. We propose a rule-exemplar method for collecting human supervision to combine the efficiency of rules with the quality of instance labels. The supervision is coupled such that it is both natural for humans and synergistic for learning. We propose a training algorithm that jointly denoises rules via latent coverage variables, and trains the model through a soft implication loss over the coverage and label variables. The denoised rules and trained model are used jointly for inference. Empirical evaluation on five different tasks shows that (1) our algorithm is more accurate than several existing methods of learning from a mix of clean and noisy supervision, and (2) the coupled rule-exemplar supervision is effective in denoising rules.	6	133	3	1	17	5.503759398496243
10	We propose a method for face de-identification that enables fully automatic video modification at high frame rates. The goal is to maximally decorrelate the identity, while having the perception (pose, illumination and expression) fixed. We achieve this by a novel feed forward encoder-decoder network architecture that is conditioned on the high-level representation of a person's facial image. The network is global, in the sense that it does not need to be retrained for a given video or for a given identity, and it creates natural-looking image sequences with little distortion in time. 	5	92	0	0	0	5.434782608695652
10	Symbolic regression is a type of discrete optimization problem that involves searching expressions that fit given data points. In many cases, other mathematical constraints about the unknown expression not only provide more information beyond just values at some inputs, but also effectively constrain the search space. We identify the asymptotic constraints of leading polynomial powers as the function approaches 0 and infinity as useful constraints and create a system to use them for symbolic regression. The first part of the system is a conditional expression generating neural network which preferentially generates expressions with the desired leading powers, producing novel expressions outside the training domain. The second part, which we call Neural-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search, uses the network during a search to find an expression that conforms to a set of data points and desired leading powers. Lastly, we provide an extensive experimental validation on thousands of target expressions showing the efficacy of our system compared to exiting methods for finding unknown functions outside of the training set.	6	168	3	1	0	5.720238095238094
10	Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient.That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve performance. We demonstrate the latter by showing that combining DNNs with novelty search, which encourages exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g.\  DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA is faster than ES, A3C, and DQN (it can train Atari in {\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}}4 hours on one workstation or {\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}}1 hour distributed on 720 cores), and enables a state-of-the-art, up to 10,000-fold compact encoding technique. 	16	253	2	0	0	6.213438735177865
10	In real-world machine learning applications, large outliers and pervasive noise are commonplace, and access to clean training data as required by standard deep autoencoders is unlikely.Reliably detecting anomalies in a given set of images is a task of high practical relevance for visual quality inspection, surveillance, or medical image analysis. Autoencoder neural networks learn to reconstruct normal images, and hence can classify those images as anomalous if the reconstruction error exceeds some threshold. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised method based on subset scanning over autoencoder activations. The contributions of our work are threefold. First, we propose a novel method combining detection with reconstruction error and subset scanning scores to improve the anomaly score of current autoencoders without requiring any retraining. Second, we provide the ability to inspect and visualize the set of anomalous nodes in the reconstruction error space that make a sample noised. Third, we show that subset scanning can be used for anomaly detection in the inner layers of the autoencoder. We provide detection power results for several untargeted adversarial noise models under standard datasets.	10	180	4	1	13	5.777777777777778
10	Existing dialog system models require extensive human annotations and are difficult to generalize to different tasks. The recent success of large pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT-2 have suggested the effectiveness of incorporating language priors in down-stream NLP tasks. However, how much pre-trained language models can help dialog response generation is still under exploration. In this paper, we propose a simple, general, and effective framework: Alternating Recurrent Dialog Model (ARDM). ARDM models each speaker separately and takes advantage of the large pre-trained language model. It requires no supervision from human annotations such as belief states or dialog acts to achieve effective conversations. ARDM outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art methods on two popular task-oriented dialog datasets: CamRest676 and MultiWOZ. Moreover, we can generalize ARDM to more challenging, non-collaborative tasks such as persuasion. In persuasion tasks, ARDM is capable of generating human-like responses to persuade people to donate to a charity.	9	153	5	1	15	6.0326797385620905
01	Due to its potential to improve programmer productivity and software quality, automated program repair has been an active topic of research. Newer techniques harness neural networks to learn directly from examples of buggy programs and their fixes. In this work, we consider a recently identified class of bugs called variable-misuse bugs. The state-of-the-art solution for variable misuse enumerates potential fixes for all possible bug locations in a program, before selecting the best prediction. We show that it is beneficial to train a model that jointly and directly localizes and repairs variable-misuse bugs. We present multi-headed pointer networks for this purpose, with one head each for localization and repair. The experimental results show that the joint model significantly outperforms an enumerative solution that uses a pointer based model for repair alone.	10	130	3	0	13	5.730769230769233
10	Learning modular structures which reflect the dynamics of the environment can lead to better generalization and robustness to changes which only affect a few of the underlying causes. We propose Recurrent Independent Mechanisms (RIMs), a new recurrent architecture in which multiple groups of recurrent cells operate with nearly independent transition dynamics, communicate only sparingly through the bottleneck of attention, and are only updated at time steps where they are most relevant.  We show that this leads to specialization amongst the RIMs, which in turn allows for dramatically improved generalization on tasks where some factors of variation differ systematically between training and evaluation.	3	102	3	0	19	5.950980392156862
10	Learning group representation is a commonly concerned issue in tasks where the basic unit is a group, set or sequence.The computer vision community tries to tackle it by aggregating the elements in a group based on an indicator either defined by human such as the quality or saliency of an element, or generated by a black box such as the attention score or output of a RNN. This article provides a more essential and explicable view. We claim the most significant indicator to show whether the group representation can be benefited from an element is not the quality, or an inexplicable score, but the \textit{discrimiability}. Our key insight is to explicitly design the \textit{discrimiability} using embedded class centroids on a proxy set, and show the discrimiability distribution \textit{w.r.t.} the element space can be distilled by a light-weight auxiliary distillation network. This processing is called \textit{discriminability distillation learning} (DDL).We show the proposed DDL can be flexibly plugged into many group based recognition tasks without influencing the training procedure of the original tasks. Comprehensive experiments on set-to-set face recognition and action recognition valid the advantage of DDL on both accuracy and efficiency, and it pushes forward the state-of-the-art results on these tasks by an impressive margin.	6	206	0	1	0	5.58252427184466
10	Predicting structured outputs such as semantic segmentation relies on expensive per-pixel annotations to learn strong supervised models like convolutional neural networks. However, these models trained on one data domain may not generalize well to other domains unequipped with annotations for model finetuning. To avoid the labor-intensive process of annotation, we develop a domain adaptation method to adapt the source data to the unlabeled target domain. To this end, we propose to learn discriminative feature representations of patches based on label histograms in the source domain, through the construction of a disentangled space. With such representations as guidance, we then use an adversarial learning scheme to push the feature representations in target patches to the closer distributions in source ones. In addition, we show that our framework can integrate a global alignment process with the proposed patch-level alignment and achieve state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation. Extensive ablation studies and experiments are conducted on numerous benchmark datasets with various settings, such as synthetic-to-real and cross-city scenarios.	9	164	3	0	13	6.1402439024390265
10	Coreference resolution is an important task for gaining more complete understanding about texts by artificial intelligence. The state-of-the-art end-to-end neural coreference model considers all spans in a document as potential mentions and learns to link an antecedent with each possible mention. However, for the verbatim same mentions, the model tends to get similar or even identical representations based on the features, and this leads to wrongful predictions. In this paper, we propose to improve the end-to-end system by building an attention model to reweigh features around different contexts. The proposed model substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art on the English dataset of the CoNLL 2012 Shared Task with 73.45% F1 score on development data and 72.84% F1 score on test data.	6	119	2	0	21	5.705882352941178
01	We describe a novel way of representing a symbolic knowledge base (KB) called a sparse-matrix reified KB.  This representation enables neural modules that are fully differentiable, faithful to the original semantics of the KB, expressive enough to model multi-hop inferences, and scalable enough to use with realistically large KBs. The sparse-matrix reified KB can be distributed across multiple GPUs, can scale to tens of millions of entities and facts, and is orders of magnitude faster than naive sparse-matrix implementations.  The reified KB enables very simple end-to-end architectures to obtain competitive performance on several benchmarks representing two families of tasks: KB completion, and learning semantic parsers from denotations.	10	107	4	0	11	5.97196261682243

We define a spread divergence $\sdiv{p}{q}$ on modified $p$ and $q$ and describe sufficient conditions for the existence of such a divergence. We give examples of using a spread divergence to train implicit generative models, including linear models (Principal Components Analysis and Independent Components Analysis) and non-linear models (Deep Generative Networks).	2	66	2	0	11	6.212121212121213
10	Convolutional neural networks memorize part of their training data, which is why strategies such as data augmentation and drop-out are employed to mitigate over- fitting. This paper considers the related question of “membership inference”, where the goal is to determine if an image was used during training. We con- sider membership tests over either ensembles of samples or individual samples.First, we show how to detect if a dataset was used to train a model, and in particular whether some validation images were used at train time. Then, we introduce a new approach to infer membership when a few of the top layers are not available or have been fine-tuned, and show that lower layers still carry information about the training samples. To support our findings, we conduct large-scale experiments on Imagenet and subsets of YFCC-100M with modern architectures such as VGG and Resnet.	11	144	4	0	26	5.1875
10	In multi-participant postings, as in online chat conversations, several conversations or topic threads may take place concurrently. This leads to difficulties for readers reviewing the postings in not only following discussions but also in quickly identifying their essence. A two-step process, disentanglement of interleaved posts followed by summarization of each thread, addresses the issue, but disentanglement errors are propagated to the summarization step, degrading the overall performance. To address this, we propose an end-to-end trainable encoder-decoder network for summarizing interleaved posts. The interleaved posts are encoded hierarchically, i.e., word-to-word (words in a post) followed by post-to-post (posts in a channel). The decoder also generates summaries hierarchically, thread-to-thread (generate thread representations) followed by word-to-word (i.e., generate summary words). Additionally, we propose a hierarchical attention mechanism for interleaved text. Overall, our end-to-end trainable hierarchical framework enhances performance over a sequence to sequence framework by 8-10% on multiple synthetic interleaved texts datasets.	7	149	0	0	0	6.798657718120805
10	In this paper, we propose a capsule-based neural network model to solve the semantic segmentation problem. By taking advantage of the extractable part-whole dependencies available in capsule layers, we derive the probabilities of the class labels for individual capsules through a recursive, layer-by-layer procedure. We model this procedure as a traceback pipeline and take it as a central piece to build an end-to-end segmentation network. Under the proposed framework, image-level class labels and object boundaries are jointly sought in an explicit manner, which poses a significant advantage over the state-of-the-art fully convolutional network (FCN) solutions. Experiments conducted on modified MNIST and neuroimages demonstrate that our model considerably enhance the segmentation performance compared to the leading FCN variant.	9	117	4	0	18	6.162393162393162
10	Attention mechanisms have advanced the state of the art in several machine learning tasks. Despite significant empirical gains, there is a lack of theoretical analyses on understanding their effectiveness. In this paper, we address this problem by studying the landscape of population and empirical loss functions of attention-based neural networks. Our results show that, under mild assumptions, every local minimum of a two-layer global attention model has low prediction error, and attention models require lower sample complexity than models not employing attention. We then extend our analyses to the popular self-attention model, proving that they deliver consistent predictions with a more expressive class of functions. Additionally, our theoretical results provide several guidelines for designing attention mechanisms. Our findings are validated with satisfactory experimental results on MNIST and IMDB reviews dataset.	3	130	4	0	24	6.1538461538461515
10	Estimating the importance of each atom in a molecule is one of the most appealing and challenging problems in chemistry, physics, and material engineering. The most common way to estimate the atomic importance is to compute the electronic structure using density-functional theory (DFT), and then to interpret it using domain knowledge of human experts. However, this conventional approach is impractical to the large molecular database because DFT calculation requires huge computation, specifically, O(n^4) time complexity w.r.t. the number of electrons in a molecule. Furthermore, the calculation results should be interpreted by the human experts to estimate the atomic importance in terms of the target molecular property. To tackle this problem, we first exploit machine learning-based approach for the atomic importance estimation. To this end, we propose reverse self-attention on graph neural networks and integrate it with graph-based molecular description. Our method provides an efficiently-automated and target-directed way to estimate the atomic importance without any domain knowledge on chemistry and physics.	7	160	4	0	23	6.0375
10	Learning synthesizers and generating music in the raw audio domain is a challenging task. We investigate the learned representations of convolutional autoregressive generative models. Consequently, we show that mappings between musical notes and the harmonic style (instrument timbre) can be learned based on the raw audio music recording and the musical score (in binary piano roll format). Our proposed architecture, SynthNet uses minimal training data (9 minutes), is substantially better in quality and converges 6 times faster than the baselines. The quality of the generated waveforms (generation accuracy) is sufficiently high that they are almost identical to the ground truth. Therefore, we are able to directly measure generation error during training, based on the RMSE of the Constant-Q transform. Mean opinion scores are also provided. We validate our work using 7 distinct harmonic styles and also provide visualizations and links to all generated audio.	4	144	6	0	13	5.729166666666668
10	Neural networks for structured data like graphs have been studied extensively in recent years.To date, the bulk of research activity has focused mainly on static graphs.However, most real-world networks are dynamic since their topology tends to change over time.Predicting the evolution of dynamic graphs is a task of high significance in the area of graph mining.Despite its practical importance, the task has not been explored in depth so far, mainly due to its challenging nature.In this paper, we propose a model that predicts the evolution of dynamic graphs.Specifically, we use a graph neural network along with a recurrent architecture to capture the temporal evolution patterns of dynamic graphs.Then, we employ a generative model which predicts the topology of the graph at the next time step and constructs a graph instance that corresponds to that topology.We evaluate the proposed model on several artificial datasets following common network evolving dynamics, as well as on real-world datasets.Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. 	11	170	4	0	36	5.341176470588235
10	In order to perform plausible interpolations in the latent space of a generative model, we need a measure that credibly reflects if a point in an interpolation is close to the data manifold being modelled, i.e. if it is convincing. In this paper, we introduce a realism index of a point, which can be constructed from an arbitrary prior density, or based on FID score approach in case a prior is not available. We propose a numerically efficient algorithm that directly maximises the realism index of an interpolation which, as we theoretically prove, leads to a search of a geodesic with respect to the corresponding Riemann structure. We show that we obtain better interpolations then the classical linear ones, in particular when either the prior density is not convex shaped, or when the soap bubble effect appears.	9	137	0	0	0	4.985401459854015
10	We propose a new architecture termed Dual Adversarial Transfer Network (DATNet) for addressing low-resource Named Entity Recognition (NER). Specifically, two variants of DATNet, i.e., DATNet-F and DATNet-P, are proposed to explore effective feature fusion between high and low resource. To address the noisy and imbalanced training data, we propose a novel Generalized Resource-Adversarial Discriminator (GRAD). Additionally, adversarial training is adopted to boost model generalization. We examine the effects of different components in DATNet across domains and languages and show that significant improvement can be obtained especially for low-resource data. Without augmenting any additional hand-crafted features, we achieve new state-of-the-art performances on CoNLL and Twitter NER---88.16% F1 for Spanish, 53.43% F1 for WNUT-2016, and 42.83% F1 for WNUT-2017.	9	117	2	0	28	6.4273504273504285
10	This paper puts forward a new text to tensor representation that relies on information compression techniques to assign shorter codes to the most frequently used characters. This representation is language-independent with no need of pretraining and produces an encoding with no information loss. It provides an adequate description of the morphology of text, as it is able to represent prefixes, declensions, and inflections with similar vectors and are able to represent even unseen words on the training dataset. Similarly, as it is compact yet sparse, is ideal for speed up training times using tensor processing libraries. As part of this paper, we show that this technique is especially effective when coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for text classification at character-level. We apply two variants of CNN coupled with it. Experimental results show that it drastically reduces the number of parameters to be optimized, resulting in competitive classification accuracy values in only a fraction of the time spent by one-hot encoding representations, thus enabling training in commodity hardware.	12	168	3	0	20	5.666666666666668

It is based on a simple idea of disentangling com-ponents of the future state which are predictable from those which are inherentlyunpredictable, and encoding the unpredictable components into a low-dimensionallatent variable which is fed into the forward model. Our method uses a simple su-pervised training objective which is fast and easy to train. We evaluate it in thecontext of video prediction on multiple datasets and show that it is able to consi-tently generate diverse predictions without the need for alternating minimizationover a latent space or adversarial training.	7	111	0	0	13	5.297297297297297
01	Mode connectivity provides novel geometric insights on analyzing loss landscapes and enables building high-accuracy pathways between well-trained neural networks. In this work, we propose to employ mode connectivity in loss landscapes to study the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks, and provide novel methods for improving this robustness.  Our experiments cover various types of adversarial attacks applied to different network architectures and datasets. When network models are tampered with backdoor or error-injection attacks, our results demonstrate that the path connection learned using limited amount of bonafide data can effectively mitigate adversarial effects while maintaining the original accuracy on clean data. Therefore, mode connectivity provides users with the power to repair backdoored or error-injected models.  We also use mode connectivity to investigate the loss landscapes of regular and robust models against evasion attacks. Experiments show that there exists a barrier in adversarial robustness loss on the path connecting regular and adversarially-trained models.  A high correlation is observed between the adversarial robustness loss and the largest eigenvalue of the input Hessian matrix, for which theoretical justifications are provided.  Our results suggest that mode connectivity offers a holistic tool and practical means for evaluating and improving adversarial robustness.	9	195	6	0	20	6.292307692307693
10	In this paper, we focus on a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, i.e., the Multi-grained NER task. This task aims to simultaneously detect both fine-grained and coarse-grained entities in sentences. Correspondingly, we develop a novel Multi-grained Entity Proposal Network (MGEPN). Different from traditional NER models which regard NER as a sequential labeling task, MGEPN provides a new method that proposes entity candidates in the Proposal Network and classifies entities into different categories in the Classification Network. All possible entity candidates including fine-grained ones and coarse-grained ones are proposed in the Proposal Network, which enables the MGEPN model to identify multi-grained entities. In order to better identify named entities and determine their categories, context information is utilized and transferred from the Proposal Network to the Classification Network during the learning process. A novel Entity-Context attention mechanism is also introduced to help the model focus on entity-related context information. Experiments show that our model can obtain state-of-the-art performance on two real-world datasets for both the Multi-grained NER task and the traditional NER task.	8	172	0	0	0	6.1104651162790695
01	Humans acquire complex skills by exploiting previously learned skills and making transitions between them. To empower machines with this ability, we propose a method that can learn transition policies which effectively connect primitive skills to perform sequential tasks without handcrafted rewards. To efficiently train our transition policies, we introduce proximity predictors which induce rewards gauging proximity to suitable initial states for the next skill. The proposed method is evaluated on a set of complex continuous control tasks in bipedal locomotion and robotic arm manipulation which traditional policy gradient methods struggle at. We demonstrate that transition policies enable us to effectively compose complex skills with existing primitive skills. The proposed induced rewards computed using the proximity predictor further improve training efficiency by providing more dense information than the sparse rewards from the environments. We make our environments, primitive skills, and code public for further research at https://youngwoon.github.io/transition .	7	147	4	0	15	6.367346938775508
10	A central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning is the induction of coordination between agents of a team. In this work, we investigate how to promote inter-agent coordination using policy regularization and discuss two possible avenues respectively based on inter-agent modelling and synchronized sub-policy selection. We test each approach in four challenging continuous control tasks with sparse rewards and compare them against three baselines including MADDPG, a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. To ensure a fair comparison, we rely on a thorough hyper-parameter selection and training methodology that allows a fixed hyper-parameter search budget for each algorithm and environment. We consequently assess both the hyper-parameter sensitivity, sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance of each learning method. Our experiments show that the proposed methods lead to significant improvements on cooperative problems. We further analyse the effects of the proposed regularizations on the behaviors learned by the agents.	10	143	6	1	14	6.468531468531468
10	As deep reinforcement learning is being applied to more and more tasks, there is a growing need to better understand and probe the learned agents. Visualizing and understanding the decision making process can be very valuable to comprehend and identify problems in the learned behavior. However, this topic has been relatively under-explored in the reinforcement learning community. In this work we present a method for synthesizing states of interest for a trained agent. Such states could be situations (e.g. crashing or damaging a car) in which specific actions are necessary. Further, critical states in which a very high or a very low reward can be achieved (e.g. risky states) are often interesting to understand the situational awareness of the system. To this end, we learn a generative model over the state space of the environment and use its latent space to optimize a target function for the state of interest. In our experiments we show that this method can generate insightful visualizations for a variety of environments and reinforcement learning methods. We explore these issues in the standard Atari benchmark games as well as in an autonomous driving simulator. Based on the efficiency with which we have been able to identify significant decision scenarios with this technique, we believe this general approach could serve as an important tool for AI safety applications.	9	222	2	0	19	5.270270270270268
10	Each training step for a variational autoencoder (VAE) requires us to sample from the approximate posterior, so we usually choose simple (e.g. factorised) approximate posteriors in which sampling is an efficient computation that fully exploits GPU parallelism.  However, such simple approximate posteriors are often insufficient, as they eliminate statistical dependencies in the posterior.  While it is possible to use normalizing flow approximate posteriors for continuous latents, there is nothing analogous for discrete latents. The most natural approach to model discrete dependencies is an autoregressive distribution, but sampling from such distributions is inherently sequential and thus slow.  We develop a fast, parallel sampling procedure for autoregressive distributions based on fixed-point iterations which enables efficient and accurate variational inference in discrete state-space models.  To optimize the variational bound, we considered two ways to evaluate probabilities: inserting the relaxed samples directly into the pmf for the discrete distribution, or converting to continuous logistic latent variables and interpreting the K-step fixed-point iterations as a normalizing flow.  We found that converting to continuous latent variables gave considerable additional scope for mismatch between the true and approximate posteriors, which resulted in biased inferences, we thus used the former approach.  We tested our approach on the neuroscience problem of inferring discrete spiking activity from noisy calcium-imaging data, and found that it gave accurate connectivity estimates in an order of magnitude less time.	10	225	3	0	13	6.257777777777778
10	We introduce the masked translation model (MTM) which combines encoding and decoding of sequences within the same model component. The MTM is based on the idea of masked language modeling and supports both autoregressive and non-autoregressive decoding strategies by simply changing the order of masking. In experiments on the WMT 2016 Romanian-English task, the MTM shows strong constant-time translation performance, beating all related approaches with comparable complexity. We also extensively compare various decoding strategies supported by the MTM, as well as several length modeling techniques and training settings.	3	88	4	0	19	6.1022727272727275
10	Dual learning has been successfully applied in many machine learning applications, including machine translation, image-to-image  transformation, etc. The high-level idea of dual learning is very intuitive: if we map an x from one domain to another and then map it back, we should recover the original x. Although its effectiveness has been empirically verified, theoretical understanding of dual learning is still missing. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study to understand why and when dual learning can improve a mapping function. Based on the theoretical discoveries, we extend dual learning by introducing more related mappings and propose highly symmetric frameworks, cycle dual learning and multipath dual learning, in both of which we can leverage the feedback signals from additional domains to improve the qualities of the mappings. We prove that both cycle dual learning and multipath dual learning can boost the performance of standard dual learning under mild conditions. Experiments on WMT 14 English↔German and MultiUN English↔French translations verify our theoretical findings on dual learning, and the results on the translations among English, French, and Spanish of MultiUN demonstrate the efficacy of cycle dual learning and multipath dual learning.	7	190	2	0	0	5.73157894736842
10	A belief persists long in machine learning that enlargement of margins over training data accounts for the resistance of models to overfitting by increasing the robustness. Yet Breiman shows a dilemma (Breiman, 1999) that a uniform improvement on margin distribution \emph{does not} necessarily reduces generalization error. In this paper, we revisit Breiman's dilemma in deep neural networks with recently proposed normalized margins using Lipschitz constant bound by spectral norm products. With both simplified theory and extensive experiments, Breiman's dilemma is shown to rely on dynamics of normalized margin distributions, that reflects the trade-off between model expression power and data complexity. When the complexity of data is comparable to the model expression power in the sense that training and test data share similar phase transitions in normalized margin dynamics, two efficient ways are derived via classic margin-based generalization bounds to successfully predict the trend of generalization error. On the other hand, over-expressed models that exhibit uniform improvements on training normalized margins may lose such a prediction power and fail to prevent the overfitting. 	12	172	4	0	35	5.9767441860465125
10	Classifiers such as deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial perturbations on problems with high-dimensional input space. While adversarial training improves the robustness of classifiers against such adversarial perturbations, it leaves classifiers sensitive to them on a non-negligible fraction of the inputs. We argue that there are two different kinds of adversarial perturbations: shared perturbations which fool a classifier on many inputs and singular perturbations which only fool the classifier on a small fraction of the data. We find that adversarial training increases the robustness of classifiers against shared perturbations. Moreover, it is particularly effective in removing universal perturbations, which can be seen as an extreme form of shared perturbations. Unfortunately, adversarial training does not consistently increase the robustness against singular perturbations on unseen inputs. However, we find that adversarial training decreases robustness of the remaining perturbations against image transformations such as changes to contrast and brightness or  Gaussian blurring. It thus makes successful attacks on the classifier in the physical world less likely. Finally, we show that even singular perturbations can be easily detected and must thus exhibit generalizable patterns even though the perturbations are specific for certain inputs. 	10	194	5	0	28	6.216494845360825
01	"Attentional, RNN-based encoder-decoder models for abstractive summarization have achieved good performance on short input and output sequences. For longer documents and summaries however these models often include repetitive and incoherent phrases. We introduce a neural network model with a novel intra-attention that attends over the input and continuously generated output separately, and a new training method that combines standard supervised word prediction and reinforcement learning (RL). Models trained only with supervised learning often exhibit ""exposure bias"" - they assume ground truth is provided at each step during training.However, when standard word prediction is combined with the global sequence prediction training of RL the resulting summaries become more readable.We evaluate this model on the CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times datasets. Our model obtains a 41.16 ROUGE-1 score on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, an improvement over previous state-of-the-art models. Human evaluation also shows that our model produces higher quality summaries."	7	151	5	0	21	6.059602649006622
10	"Answering questions about a text frequently requires aggregating information from multiple places in that text. End-to-end neural network models, the dominant approach in the current literature, can theoretically learn how to distill and manipulate representations of the text without explicit supervision about how to do so. We investigate a canonical architecture for this task, the memory network, and analyze how effective it really is in the context of three multi-hop reasoning settings. In a simple synthetic setting, the path-finding task of the bAbI dataset, the model fails to learn the correct reasoning without additional supervision of its attention mechanism. However, with this supervision, it can perform well. On a real text dataset, WikiHop, the memory network gives nearly state-of-the-art performance, but does so without using its multi-hop capabilities. A tougher anonymized version of the WikiHop dataset is qualitatively similar to bAbI: the model fails to perform well unless it has additional supervision. We hypothesize that many ""multi-hop"" architectures do not truly learn this reasoning as advertised, though they could learn this reasoning if appropriately supervised."	13	175	4	0	11	5.857142857142858
10	This paper develops a novel methodology for using symbolic knowledge in deep learning. From first principles, we derive a semantic loss function that bridges between neural output vectors and logical constraints. This loss function captures how close the neural network is to satisfying the constraints on its output. An experimental evaluation shows that our semantic loss function effectively guides the learner to achieve (near-)state-of-the-art results on semi-supervised multi-class classification. Moreover, it significantly increases the ability of the neural network to predict structured objects, such as rankings and shortest paths. These discrete concepts are tremendously difficult to learn, and benefit from a tight integration of deep learning and symbolic reasoning methods.	10	110	4	0	0	6.181818181818183
10	We introduce interpretable components into a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to explain its decision mechanism. Instead of reasoning a decision from a given trained neural network, we design an interpretable neural network architecture before training. Weight values in the first layers of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a ResNet-50 are replaced by well-known predefined kernels such as sharpening, embossing, color filters, etc. Each filter's relative importance is measured with a variant of the saliency map and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) proposed by Simonyan et al. and Bach et al. We suggest that images processed by predefined kernels still contain enough information for DNNs to extract features without degrading performances on MNIST, and ImageNet datasets. Our model based on the ResNet-50 shows 92.1% top-5 and 74.6% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. At the same time, our model provides three different tools to explain individual classification and overall properties of a certain class; the relative importance scores with respects to (1) each color, (2) each filter, and (3) each pixel of the image.  	12	173	3	0	0	5.572254335260116
10	Planning at roundabout is crucial for autonomous driving in urban and rural environments. Reinforcement learning is promising not only in dealing with complicated environment but also taking safety constraints into account as a as a constrained Markov Decision Process. However, the safety constraints should be explicitly mathematically formulated while this is challenging for planning at roundabout due to unpredicted dynamic behavior of the obstacles. Therefore, to discriminate the obstacles' states as either safe or unsafe is desired which is known as situation awareness modeling. In this paper, we combine variational learning and constrained reinforcement learning to simultaneously learn a Conditional Representation Model (CRM) to encode the states into safe and unsafe distributions respectively as well as to learn the corresponding safe policy.  Our approach is evaluated in using Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and it can generalize to various traffic flows.	10	143	3	1	0	5.9720279720279725
10	Learning-to-learn or meta-learning leverages data-driven inductive bias to increase the efficiency of learning on a novel task. This approach encounters difficulty when transfer is not mutually beneficial, for instance, when tasks are sufficiently dissimilar or change over time. Here, we use the connection between gradient-based meta-learning and hierarchical Bayes to propose a mixture of hierarchical Bayesian models over the parameters of an arbitrary function approximator such as a neural network. Generalizing the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm, we present a stochastic expectation maximization procedure to jointly estimate parameter initializations for gradient descent as well as a latent assignment of tasks to initializations. This approach better captures the diversity of training tasks as opposed to consolidating inductive biases into a single set of hyperparameters. Our experiments demonstrate better generalization on the standard miniImageNet benchmark for 1-shot classification. We further derive a novel and scalable non-parametric variant of our method that captures the evolution of a task distribution over time as demonstrated on a set of few-shot regression tasks.	7	166	7	0	26	6.2771084337349405
01	This paper describes a new form of unsupervised learning, whose input is a set of unlabeled points that are assumed to be local maxima of an unknown value function $v$ in an unknown subset of the vector space. Two functions are learned: (i) a set indicator $c$, which is a binary classifier, and (ii) a comparator function $h$ that given two nearby samples, predicts which sample has the higher value of the unknown function $v$. Loss terms are used to ensure that all training samples $\vx$ are a local maxima of $v$, according to $h$ and satisfy $c(\vx)=1$. Therefore, $c$ and $h$ provide training signals to each other: a point $\vx'$ in the vicinity of $\vx$ satisfies $c(\vx)=-1$ or is deemed by $h$ to be lower in value than $\vx$. We present an algorithm, show an example where it is more efficient to use local maxima as an indicator function than to employ conventional classification, and derive a suitable generalization bound. Our experiments show that the method is able to outperform one-class classification algorithms in the task of anomaly detection and also provide an additional signal that is extracted in a completely unsupervised way.	8	194	3	0	0	4.963917525773196
01	Real-world tasks are often highly structured. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has attracted research interest as an approach for leveraging the hierarchical structure of a given task in reinforcement learning (RL). However, identifying the hierarchical policy structure that enhances the performance of RL is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose an HRL method that learns a latent variable of a hierarchical policy using mutual information maximization. Our approach can be interpreted as a way to learn a discrete and latent representation of the state-action space. To learn option policies that correspond to modes of the advantage function, we introduce advantage-weighted importance sampling.  In our HRL method, the gating policy learns to select option policies based on an option-value function, and these option policies are optimized based on the deterministic policy gradient method. This framework is derived by leveraging the analogy between a monolithic policy in standard RL and a hierarchical policy in HRL by using a deterministic option policy.  Experimental results indicate that our HRL approach can learn a diversity of options and that it can enhance the performance of RL in continuous control tasks.	7	187	3	0	17	5.636363636363638
01	Inductive and unsupervised graph learning is a critical technique for predictive or information retrieval tasks where label information is difficult to obtain. It is also challenging to make graph learning inductive and unsupervised at the same time, as learning processes guided by reconstruction error based loss functions inevitably demand graph similarity evaluation that is usually computationally intractable. In this paper, we propose a general framework SEED (Sampling, Encoding, and Embedding Distributions) for inductive and unsupervised representation learning on graph structured objects. Instead of directly dealing with the computational challenges raised by graph similarity evaluation, given an input graph, the SEED framework samples a number of subgraphs whose reconstruction errors could be efficiently evaluated, encodes the subgraph samples into a collection of subgraph vectors, and employs the embedding of the subgraph vector distribution as the output vector representation for the input graph. By theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the close connection between SEED and graph isomorphism. Using public benchmark datasets, our empirical study suggests the proposed SEED framework is able to achieve up to 10% improvement, compared with competitive baseline methods.	9	179	3	0	15	6.223463687150838
01	Momentum is a simple and widely used trick which allows gradient-based optimizers to pick up speed along low curvature directions. Its performance depends crucially on a damping coefficient. Largecamping  coefficients can potentially deliver much larger speedups, but are prone to oscillations and instability; hence one typically resorts to small values such as 0.5 or 0.9. We propose Aggregated Momentum (AggMo), a variant of momentum which combines multiple velocity vectors with different damping coefficients. AggMo is trivial to implement, but significantly dampens oscillations, enabling it to remain stable even for aggressive damping coefficients such as 0.999. We reinterpret Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent as a special case of AggMo and analyze rates of convergence for quadratic objectives. Empirically, we find that AggMo is a suitable drop-in replacement for other momentum methods, and frequently delivers faster convergence with little to no tuning.	6	139	4	0	26	6.0071942446043165
10	Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarially-constructed perturbations of their inputs. Most research so far has considered perturbations of a fixed magnitude under some $l_p$ norm. Although studying these attacks is valuable, there has been increasing interest in the construction of—and robustness to—unrestricted attacks, which are not constrained to a small and rather artificial subset of all possible adversarial inputs. We introduce a novel algorithm for generating such unrestricted adversarial inputs which, unlike prior work, is adaptive: it is able to tune its attacks to the classifier being targeted. It also offers a 400–2,000× speedup over the existing state of the art. We demonstrate our approach by generating unrestricted adversarial inputs that fool classifiers robust to perturbation-based attacks. We also show that, by virtue of being adaptive and unrestricted, our attack is able to bypass adversarial training against it.	6	138	4	0	7	5.884057971014492
01	"Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) have recently attracted significant interest due to their computational efficiency. Concurrently, it has been shown that neural networks may be overly sensitive to ``attacks"" -- tiny adversarial changes in the input -- which may be detrimental to their use in safety-critical domains. Designing attack algorithms that effectively fool trained models is a key step towards learning robust neural networks.The discrete, non-differentiable nature of BNNs, which distinguishes them from their full-precision counterparts, poses a challenge to gradient-based attacks. In this work, we study the problem of attacking a BNN through the lens of combinatorial and integer optimization. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation of the problem. While exact and flexible, the MILP quickly becomes intractable as the network and perturbation space grow. To address this issue, we propose IProp, a decomposition-based algorithm that solves a sequence of much smaller MILP problems. Experimentally, we evaluate both proposed methods against the standard gradient-based attack (PGD) on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and show that IProp performs favorably compared to PGD, while scaling beyond the limits of the MILP."	6	181	3	0	25	5.928176795580112
01	Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results ona number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly,especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improvethe efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attentionby one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexityfrom O($L^2$) to O($L \log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence.Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standardresiduals, which allows storing activations only once in the trainingprocess instead of N times, where N is the number of layers.The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer modelswhile being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.	4	117	3	1	8	5.666666666666668

In this paper, we propose an auxiliary module to be attached to a GNN that can boost the representation power of the model without hindering the original GNN architecture. Our auxiliary module can improve the representation power and the generalization ability of a wide variety of GNNs, including those that are used commonly in biochemical applications. 	18	110	4	0	32	5.336363636363637
10	Dropout has been one of standard approaches to train deep neural networks, and it is known to regularize large models to avoid overfitting. The effect of dropout has been explained by avoiding co-adaptation.In this paper, however, we propose a new explanation of why dropout works and propose a new technique to design better activation functions. First, we show that dropout can be explained as an optimization technique to push the input towards the saturation area of nonlinear activation function by accelerating gradient information flowing even in the saturation area in backpropagation. Based on this explanation, we propose a new technique for activation functions, {\em gradient acceleration in activation function (GAAF)}, that accelerates gradients to flow even in the saturation area. Then, input to the activation function can climb onto the saturation area which makes the network more robust because the model converges on a flat region.  Experiment results support our explanation of dropout and confirm that the proposed GAAF technique improves performances with expected properties.	5	166	4	0	0	5.632530120481928

Our approach caters to subjective search where the user is seeking digital assets such as images which is fundamentally different from the tasks which have objective and limited search modalities. Labeled conversational data is generally not available in such search tasks and training the agent through human interactions can be time consuming. We propose a stochastic virtual user which impersonates a real user and can be used to sample user behavior efficiently to train the agent which accelerates the bootstrapping of the agent. We develop A3C algorithm based context preserving architecture which enables the agent to provide contextual assistance to the user. We compare the A3C agent with Q-learning and evaluate its performance on average rewards and state values it obtains with the virtual user in validation episodes.

10	Understanding physical phenomena is a key component of human intelligence and enables physical interaction with previously unseen environments. In this paper, we study how an artificial agent can autonomously acquire this intuition through interaction with the environment. We created a synthetic block stacking environment with physics simulation in which the agent can learn a policy end-to-end through trial and error. Thereby, we bypass to explicitly model physical knowledge within the policy. We are specifically interested in tasks that require the agent to reach a given goal state that may be different for every new trial. To this end, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that learns policies which are parametrized by a goal. We validated the model on a toy example navigating in a grid world with different target positions and in a block stacking task with different target structures of the final tower. In contrast to prior work, our policies show better generalization across different goals.	9	158	0	0	0	5.481012658227848
01	Traditional compression methods including network pruning, quantization, low rank factorization and knowledge distillation all assume that network architectures and parameters should be hardwired.  In this work, we propose a new perspective on network compression, i.e., network parameters can be disentangled from the architectures.  From this viewpoint, we present the Neural Epitome Search (NES), a new neural network compression approach that learns to find compact yet expressive epitomes for weight parameters of a specified network architecture end-to-end. The complete network to compress can be generated from the learned epitome via a novel transformation method that adaptively transforms the epitomes to match shapes of the given architecture. Compared with existing compression methods, NES allows the weight tensors to be independent of the architecture design and hence can achieve a good trade-off between model compression rate and performance given a specific model size constraint. Experiments demonstrate that, on ImageNet, when taking MobileNetV2 as backbone, our approach improves the full-model baseline by 1.47% in top-1 accuracy with 25% MAdd reduction and AutoML for Model Compression (AMC) by 2.5% with nearly the same compression ratio. Moreover, taking EfficientNet-B0 as baseline, our NES yields an improvement of 1.2% but are with 10% less MAdd.  In particular, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art results of 77.5% under mobile settings (<350M MAdd). Code will be made publicly available.	7	220	4	0	19	5.927272727272728
01	A machine learning model that generalizes well should obtain low errors on unseen test examples. Thus, if we know how to optimally perturb training examples to account for test examples, we may achieve better generalization performance. However, obtaining such perturbation is not possible in standard machine learning frameworks as the distribution of the test data is unknown. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel regularization method, meta-dropout, which learns to perturb the latent features of training examples for generalization in a meta-learning framework. Specifically, we meta-learn a noise generator which outputs a multiplicative noise distribution for latent features, to obtain low errors on the test instances in an input-dependent manner. Then, the learned noise generator can perturb the training examples of unseen tasks at the meta-test time for improved generalization. We validate our method on few-shot classification datasets, whose results show that it significantly improves the generalization performance of the base model, and largely outperforms existing regularization methods such as information bottleneck, manifold mixup, and information dropout.	9	168	0	1	0	6.0773809523809526
01	Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance in many computer vision tasks. Most state-of-the-art~(SOTA) semantic segmentation and object detection approaches reuse neural network architectures designed for image classification as the backbone, commonly pre-trained on ImageNet. However, performance gains can be achieved by designing network architectures specifically for detection and segmentation, as shown by recent neural architecture search (NAS) research for detection and segmentation. One major challenge though, is that ImageNet pre-training of the search space representation (a.k.a. super network) or the searched networks incurs huge computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fast Neural Network Adaptation (FNA) method, which can adapt both the architecture and parameters of a seed network (e.g. a high performing manually designed backbone) to become a network with different depth, width, or kernels via a Parameter Remapping technique, making it possible to utilize NAS for detection/segmentation tasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we conduct FNA on MobileNetV2 to obtain new networks for both segmentation and detection that clearly out-perform existing networks designed both manually and by NAS. The total computation cost of FNA is significantly less than SOTA segmentation/detection NAS approaches: 1737$\times$ less than DPC, 6.8$\times$ less than Auto-DeepLab and 7.4$\times$ less than DetNAS. The code is available at https://github.com/JaminFong/FNA .	10	207	0	1	0	6.285024154589372

The proposed model, dubbed Neural Stored-program Memory, augments current memory-augmented neural networks, creating differentiable machines that can switch programs through time, adapt to variable contexts and thus fully resemble the Universal Turing Machine. A wide range of experiments demonstrate that the resulting machines not only excel in classical algorithmic problems, but also have potential for compositional, continual, few-shot learning and question-answering tasks. 	3	114	3	1	7	6.245614035087719
10	To understand the inner work of deep neural networks and provide possible theoretical explanations, we study the deep representations through the untrained, random weight CNN-DCN architecture. As a convolutional AutoEncoder, CNN indicates the portion of a convolutional neural network from the input to an intermediate convolutional layer, and DCN indicates the corresponding deconvolutional portion. As compared with DCN training for pre-trained CNN, training the DCN for random-weight CNN converges more quickly and yields higher quality image reconstruction. Then, what happens for the overall random CNN-DCN? We gain intriguing results that the image can be reconstructed with good quality. To gain more insight on the intermediate random representation, we investigate the impact of network width versus depth, number of random channels, and size of random kernels on the reconstruction quality, and provide theoretical justifications on empirical observations. We further provide a fast style transfer application using the random weight CNN-DCN architecture to show the potential of our observation.	7	157	4	0	20	6.050955414012739
10	Adaptive gradient methods, which adopt historical gradient information to automatically adjust the learning rate, despite the nice property of fast convergence, have been observed to generalize worse than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum in training deep neural networks. This leaves how to close the generalization gap of adaptive gradient methods an open problem. In this work, we show that adaptive gradient methods such as Adam, Amsgrad, are sometimes ``over adapted''. We design a new algorithm, called Partially adaptive momentum estimation method, which unifies the Adam/Amsgrad with SGD by introducing a partial adaptive parameter $p$, to achieve the best from both worlds. We also prove the convergence rate of our proposed algorithm to a stationary point in the stochastic nonconvex optimization setting. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our proposed algorithm can maintain fast convergence rate as Adam/Amsgrad while generalizing as well as SGD in training deep neural networks. These results would suggest practitioners pick up adaptive gradient methods once again for faster training of deep neural networks.	8	168	0	1	0	5.8392857142857135
10	Extensive work on compressed sensing has yielded a rich collection of sparse recovery algorithms, each making different tradeoffs between recovery condition and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for accelerating various existing sparse recovery algorithms without sacrificing recovery guarantees by exploiting structure in the measurement matrix. Unlike fast algorithms that are specific to particular choices of measurement matrices where the columns are Fourier or wavelet filters for example, the proposed approach works on a broad range of measurement matrices that satisfy a particular property. We precisely characterize this property, which quantifies how easy it is to accelerate sparse recovery for the measurement matrix in question. We also derive the time complexity of the accelerated algorithm, which is sublinear in the signal length in each iteration. Moreover, we present experimental results on real world data that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practice. 	6	148	1	0	0	6.027027027027027
01	We provide a theoretical algorithm for checking local optimality and escaping saddles at nondifferentiable points of empirical risks of two-layer ReLU networks. Our algorithm receives any parameter value and returns: local minimum, second-order stationary point, or a strict descent direction. The presence of M data points on the nondifferentiability of the ReLU divides the parameter space into at most 2^M regions, which makes analysis difficult. By exploiting polyhedral geometry, we reduce the total computation down to one convex quadratic program (QP) for each hidden node, O(M) (in)equality tests, and one (or a few) nonconvex QP. For the last QP, we show that our specific problem can be solved efficiently, in spite of nonconvexity. In the benign case, we solve one equality constrained QP, and we prove that projected gradient descent solves it exponentially fast. In the bad case, we have to solve a few more inequality constrained QPs, but we prove that the time complexity is exponential only in the number of inequality constraints. Our experiments show that either benign case or bad case with very few inequality constraints occurs, implying that our algorithm is efficient in most cases.	10	189	6	0	21	5.3809523809523805
01	The question of whether deep neural networks are good at generalising beyond their immediate training experience is of critical importance for learning-based approaches to AI. Here, we consider tests of out-of-sample generalisation that require an agent to respond to never-seen-before instructions by manipulating and positioning objects in a 3D Unity simulated room. We first describe a comparatively generic agent architecture that exhibits strong performance on these tests. We then identify three aspects of the training regime and environment that make a significant difference to its performance: (a) the number of object/word experiences in the training set; (b) the visual invariances afforded by the agent's perspective, or frame of reference; and (c) the variety of visual input inherent in the perceptual aspect of the agent's perception. Our findings indicate that the degree of generalisation that networks exhibit can depend critically on particulars of the environment in which a given task is instantiated. They further suggest that the propensity for neural networks to generalise in systematic ways may increase if, like human children, those networks have access to many frames of richly varying, multi-modal observations as they learn.	10	186	8	0	18	5.758064516129032
10	For the challenging semantic image segmentation task the best performing modelshave traditionally combined the structured modelling capabilities of ConditionalRandom Fields (CRFs) with the feature extraction power of CNNs. In more recentworks however, CRF post-processing has fallen out of favour. We argue that thisis mainly due to the slow training and inference speeds of CRFs, as well as thedifficulty of learning the internal CRF parameters. To overcome both issues wepropose to add the assumption of conditional independence to the framework offully-connected CRFs. This allows us to reformulate the inference in terms ofconvolutions, which can be implemented highly efficiently on GPUs.Doing sospeeds up inference and training by two orders of magnitude. All parameters ofthe convolutional CRFs can easily be optimized using backpropagation. Towardsthe goal of facilitating further CRF research we have made our implementationspublicly available.	5	145	4	0	14	5.662068965517242
01	Recovering sparse conditional independence graphs from data is a fundamental problem in machine learning with wide applications. A popular formulation of the problem is an $\ell_1$ regularized maximum likelihood estimation. Many convex optimization algorithms have been designed to solve this formulation to recover the graph structure. Recently, there is a surge of interest to learn algorithms directly based on data, and in this case, learn to map empirical covariance to the sparse precision matrix. However, it is a challenging task in this case, since the symmetric positive definiteness (SPD) and sparsity of the matrix are not easy to enforce in learned algorithms, and a direct mapping from data to precision matrix may contain many parameters. We propose a deep learning architecture, GLAD, which uses an Alternating Minimization (AM) algorithm as our model inductive bias, and learns the model parameters via supervised learning. We show that GLAD learns a very compact and effective model for recovering sparse graphs from data.	5	159	4	1	15	5.547169811320754
10	Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing tasks. Despite good performance, Transformers are still weak in long sentence modeling where the global attention map is too dispersed to capture valuable information.In such case, the local/token features that are also significant to sequence modeling are omitted to some extent.To address this problem, we propose a Multi-scale attention model (MUSE) by concatenating attention networks with convolutional networks and position-wise feed-forward networks to explicitly capture local and token features. Considering the parameter size and computation efficiency, we re-use the feed-forward layer in the original Transformer and adopt a lightweight dynamic convolution as implementation. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves substantial performance improvements over Transformer, especially on long sentences, and pushes the state-of-the-art from 35.6 to 36.2 on IWSLT 2014  German to English translation task,  from 30.6 to 31.3 on  IWSLT 2015 English to Vietnamese translation task. We also reach the state-of-art performance on  WMT 2014 English to French translation dataset, with a BLEU score of 43.2.	9	172	5	0	16	6.1104651162790695
10	The rise of graph-structured data such as social networks, regulatory networks, citation graphs, and functional brain networks, in combination with resounding success of deep learning in various applications, has brought the interest in generalizing deep learning models to non-Euclidean domains. In this paper, we introduce a new spectral domain convolutional architecture for deep learning on graphs. The core ingredient of our model is a new class of parametric rational complex functions (Cayley polynomials) allowing to efficiently compute spectral filters on graphs that specialize on frequency bands of interest. Our model generates rich spectral filters that are localized in space, scales linearly with the size of the input data for sparsely-connected graphs, and can handle different constructions of Laplacian operators. Extensive experimental results show the superior performance of our approach on spectral image classification, community detection, vertex classification and matrix completion tasks.	8	141	2	0	10	6.205673758865247
01	"We propose a neural network for unsupervised anomaly detection with a novel robust subspace recovery layer (RSR layer). This layer seeks to extract the underlying subspace from a latent representation of the given data and removes outliers that lie away from this subspace. It is used within an autoencoder. The encoder maps the data into a latent space, from which the RSR layer extracts the subspace. The decoder then smoothly maps back the underlying subspace to a ``manifold"" close to the original inliers. Inliers and outliers are distinguished according to the distances between the original and mapped positions (small for inliers and large for outliers). Extensive numerical experiments with both image and document datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art precision and recall. "	8	119	5	0	23	5.588235294117646
10	We present a selective sampling method designed to accelerate the training of deep neural networks. To this end,  we introduce a novel measurement,  the {\it minimal margin score} (MMS), which measures the minimal amount of displacement an input should take until its predicted classification is switched.   For multi-class linear classification,  the MMS measure is a natural generalization of the margin-based selection criterion, which was thoroughly studied in the binary classification setting.  In addition, the MMS measure provides an interesting insight into the progress of the training process and can be useful for designing and monitoring new training regimes. Empirically we demonstrate a substantial acceleration when training commonly used deep neural network architectures for popular image classification tasks.  The efficiency of our method is compared against the standard training procedures, and against commonly used selective sampling alternatives: Hard negative mining selection, and Entropy-based selection.Finally, we demonstrate an additional speedup when we adopt a more aggressive learning-drop regime while using the MMS selective sampling method.	9	164	0	1	0	6.146341463414633
10	We show that if the usual training loss is augmented by a Lipschitz regularization term, then the networks generalize.  We prove generalization by first establishing a stronger convergence result, along with a rate of convergence.   A second result resolves a question posed in Zhang et al. (2016): how can a model distinguish between the case of clean labels, and randomized labels?  Our answer is that Lipschitz regularization using the Lipschitz constant of the clean data makes this distinction.  In this case, the model learns a different function which we hypothesize correctly fails to learn the dirty labels.  	6	97	6	0	25	5.309278350515464
01	Image-to-image translation has recently received significant attention due to advances in deep learning. Most works focus on learning either a one-to-one mapping in an unsupervised way or a many-to-many mapping in a supervised way. However, a more practical setting is many-to-many mapping in an unsupervised way, which is harder due to the lack of supervision and the complex inner- and cross-domain variations. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Exemplar Guided & Semantically Consistent Image-to-image Translation (EGSC-IT) network which conditions the translation process on an exemplar image in the target domain. We assume that an image comprises of a content component which is shared across domains, and a style component specific to each domain. Under the guidance of an exemplar from the target domain we apply Adaptive Instance Normalization to the shared content component, which allows us to transfer the style information of the target domain to the source domain. To avoid semantic inconsistencies during translation that naturally appear due to the large inner- and cross-domain variations, we introduce the concept of feature masks that provide coarse semantic guidance without requiring the use of any semantic labels. Experimental results on various datasets show that EGSC-IT does not only translate the source image to diverse instances in the target domain, but also preserves the semantic consistency during the process. 	8	218	3	0	25	5.655963302752293
10	The application of stochastic variance reduction to optimization has shown remarkable recent theoretical and practical success. The applicability of these techniques to the hard non-convex optimization problems encountered during training of modern deep neural networks is an open problem. We show that naive application of the SVRG technique and related approaches fail, and explore why.	10	55	3	0	9	6.072727272727272
10	We study the problem of explaining a rich class of behavioral properties of deep neural networks. Our influence-directed explanations approach this problem by peering inside the network to identify neurons with high influence on the property of interest using an axiomatically justified influence measure, and then providing an interpretation for the concepts these neurons represent. We evaluate our approach by training convolutional neural networks on Pubfig, ImageNet, and Diabetic Retinopathy datasets.  Our evaluation demonstrates that influence-directed explanations (1) localize features used by the network, (2) isolate features distinguishing related instances, (3) help extract the essence of what the network learned about the class, and (4) assist in debugging misclassifications.	6	109	4	0	37	6.275229357798165
10	Hyperparameter tuning is one of the most time-consuming workloads in deep learning. State-of-the-art optimizers, such as AdaGrad, RMSProp and Adam, reduce this labor by adaptively tuning an individual learning rate for each variable. Recently researchers have shown renewed interest in simpler methods like momentum SGD as they may yield better results. Motivated by this trend, we ask: can simple adaptive methods, based on SGD perform as well or better? We revisit the momentum SGD algorithm and show that hand-tuning a single learning rate and momentum makes it competitive with Adam. We then analyze its robustness to learning rate misspecification and objective curvature variation. Based on these insights, we design YellowFin, an automatic tuner for momentum and learning rate in SGD. YellowFin optionally uses a negative-feedback loop to compensate for the momentum dynamics in asynchronous settings on the fly. We empirically show YellowFin can converge in fewer iterations than Adam on ResNets and LSTMs for image recognition, language modeling and constituency parsing, with a speedup of up to $3.28$x in synchronous and up to $2.69$x in asynchronous settings.	7	177	3	0	13	5.621468926553671
10	We propose a generalization error bound for a general family of deep neural networks based on the depth and width of the networks, as well as the spectral norm of weight matrices. Through introducing a novel characterization of the Lipschitz properties of neural network family, we achieve a tighter generalization error bound. We further obtain a result that is free of linear dependence on norms for bounded losses. Besides the general deep neural networks, our results can be applied to derive new bounds for several popular architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), residual networks (ResNets), and hyperspherical networks (SphereNets).  When achieving same generalization errors with previous arts, our bounds allow for the choice of much larger parameter spaces of weight matrices, inducing potentially stronger expressive ability for neural networks.	12	129	3	0	0	5.8062015503875966
10	Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) has shown to be effective for improving and accelerating the training of deep neural networks. However, recently it has been shown that it is also vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. In this work, we aim to investigate the cause of adversarial vulnerability of the BatchNorm. We hypothesize that the use of different normalization statistics during training and inference (mini-batch statistics for training and moving average of these values at inference) is the main cause of this adversarial vulnerability in the BatchNorm layer. We empirically proved this by experiments on various neural network architectures and datasets. Furthermore, we introduce Robust Normalization (RobustNorm) and experimentally show that it is not only resilient to adversarial perturbation but also inherit the benefits of BatchNorm.	6	122	3	0	12	5.9836065573770485
10	Numerous machine reading comprehension (MRC) datasets often involve manual annotation, requiring enormous human effort, and hence the size of the dataset remains significantly smaller than the size of the data available for unsupervised learning. Recently, researchers proposed a model for generating synthetic question-and-answer data from large corpora such as Wikipedia. This model is utilized to generate synthetic data for training an MRC model before fine-tuning it using the original MRC dataset. This technique shows better performance than other general pre-training techniques such as language modeling, because the characteristics of the generated data are similar to those of the downstream MRC data. However, it is difficult to have high-quality synthetic data comparable to human-annotated MRC datasets. To address this issue, we propose Answer-containing Sentence Generation (ASGen), a novel pre-training method for generating synthetic data involving two advanced techniques, (1) dynamically determining K answers and (2) pre-training the question generator on the answer-containing sentence generation task. We evaluate the question generation capability of our method by comparing the BLEU score with existing methods and test our method by fine-tuning the MRC model on the downstream MRC data after training on synthetic data. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing generation methods and increases the performance of the state-of-the-art MRC models across a range of MRC datasets such as SQuAD-v1.1, SQuAD-v2.0, KorQuAD and QUASAR-T without any architectural modifications to the original MRC model.	14	231	5	0	18	6.125541125541125
01	While most machine translation systems to date are trained on large parallel corpora, humans learn language in a different way: by being grounded in an environment and interacting with other humans. In this work, we propose a communication game where two agents, native speakers of their own respective languages, jointly learn to solve a visual referential task. We find that the ability to understand and translate a foreign language emerges as a means to achieve shared goals. The emergent translation is interactive and multimodal, and crucially does not require parallel corpora, but only monolingual, independent text and corresponding images. Our proposed translation model achieves this by grounding the source and target languages into a shared visual modality, and outperforms several baselines on both word-level and sentence-level translation tasks. Furthermore, we show that agents in a multilingual community learn to translate better and faster than in a bilingual communication setting.	5	149	0	0	0	5.731543624161074
01	The learning rate warmup heuristic achieves remarkable success in stabilizing training, accelerating convergence and improving generalization for adaptive stochastic optimization algorithms like RMSprop and Adam. Pursuing the theory behind warmup, we identify a problem of the adaptive learning rate -- its variance is problematically large in the early stage, and presume warmup works as a variance reduction technique. We provide both empirical and theoretical evidence to verify our hypothesis. We further propose Rectified Adam (RAdam), a novel variant of Adam, by introducing a term to rectify the variance of the adaptive learning rate. Experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and neural machine translation verify our intuition and demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of RAdam. 	10	115	4	1	9	6.078260869565217
01	Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in highly energy-constrained environments such as autonomous drones and wearable devices while at the same time must operate in real-time. Therefore, reducing the energy consumption has become a major design consideration in DNN training. This paper proposes the first end-to-end DNN training framework that provides quantitative energy consumption guarantees via weighted sparse projection and input masking. The key idea is to formulate the DNN training as an optimization problem in which the energy budget imposes a previously unconsidered optimization constraint. We integrate the quantitative DNN energy estimation into the DNN training process to assist the constrained optimization. We prove that an approximate algorithm can be used to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Compared to the best prior energy-saving techniques, our framework trains DNNs that provide higher accuracies under same or lower energy budgets.	14	140	3	0	0	6.064285714285713
01	Generalization of deep networks has been intensely researched in recent years, resulting in a number of theoretical bounds and empirically motivated measures. However, most papers proposing such measures only study a small set of models, leaving open the question of whether these measures are truly useful in practice. We present the first large scale study of generalization bounds and measures in deep networks. We train over two thousand CIFAR-10 networks with systematic changes in important hyper-parameters. We attempt to uncover potential causal relationships between each measure and generalization, by using rank correlation coefficient and its modified forms. We analyze the results and show that some of the studied measures are very promising for further research.	8	115	3	1	31	5.765217391304348
10	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are based on repeated aggregations of information across nodes’ neighbors in a graph.  However, because common neighbors are shared between different nodes, this leads to repeated and inefficient computations.We propose Hierarchically Aggregated computation Graphs (HAGs), a new GNN graph representation that explicitly avoids redundancy by managing intermediate aggregation  results  hierarchically,  and  eliminating  repeated  computations  and unnecessary data transfers in GNN training and inference. We introduce an accurate cost function to quantitatively evaluate the runtime performance of different HAGsand use a novel search algorithm to find optimized HAGs.  Experiments show that the HAG representation significantly outperforms the standard GNN graph representation by increasing the end-to-end training throughput by up to 2.8x and reducing the aggregations and data transfers in GNN training by up to 6.3x and 5.6x. Meanwhile, HAGs improve runtime performance by preserving GNNcomputation, and maintain the original model accuracy for arbitrary GNNs.	7	147	2	1	22	6.3945578231292535
10	Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been repeatedly shown to perform well on image classification tasks, successfully recognizing a broad array of objects when given sufficient training data. Methods for object localization, however, are still in need of substantial improvement. Common approaches to this problem involve the use of a sliding window, sometimes at multiple scales, providing input to a deep CNN trained to classify the contents of the window. In general, these approaches are time consuming, requiring many classification calculations. In this paper, we offer a fundamentally different approach to the localization of recognized objects in images. Our method is predicated on the idea that a deep CNN capable of recognizing an object must implicitly contain knowledge about object location in its connection weights. We provide a simple method to interpret classifier weights in the context of individual classified images. This method involves the calculation of the derivative of network generated activation patterns, such as the activation of output class label units, with regard to each in- put pixel, performing a sensitivity analysis that identifies the pixels that, in a local sense, have the greatest influence on internal representations and object recognition. These derivatives can be efficiently computed using a single backward pass through the deep CNN classifier, producing a sensitivity map of the image. We demonstrate that a simple linear mapping can be learned from sensitivity maps to bounding box coordinates, localizing the recognized object. Our experimental results, using real-world data sets for which ground truth localization information is known, reveal competitive accuracy from our fast technique.	6	259	3	0	18	5.787644787644787
10	 Reinforcement learning methods have recently achieved impressive results on a wide range of control problems. However, especially with complex inputs, they still require an extensive amount of training data in order to converge to a meaningful solution. This limitation largely prohibits  their usage for complex input spaces such as video signals, and it is still impossible to use it for a number of complex problems in a real world environments, including many of those for video based control. Supervised learning, on the contrary, is capable of learning on a relatively small number of samples, however it does not take into account reward-based control policies and is not capable to provide independent control policies.  In this article we propose a model-free control method, which uses a combination of reinforcement and supervised learning for autonomous control and paves the way towards policy based control in real world environments. We use SpeedDreams/TORCS video game to demonstrate that our approach requires much less samples (hundreds of thousands against millions or tens of millions) comparing to the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques on similar data, and at the same time overcomes both supervised and reinforcement learning approaches in terms of quality. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of the method to MuJoCo control problems. 	10	207	3	0	19	5.685990338164253
10	Capturing long-range feature relations has been a central issue on convolutional neural networks(CNNs). To tackle this, attempts to integrate end-to-end trainable attention module on CNNs are widespread. Main goal of these works is to adjust feature maps considering spatial-channel correlation inside a convolution layer. In this paper, we focus on modeling relationships among layers and propose a novel structure, 'Recurrent Layer Attention network,' which stores the hierarchy of features into recurrent neural networks(RNNs) that concurrently propagating with CNN and adaptively scales feature volumes of all layers. We further introduce several structural derivatives for demonstrating the compatibility on recent attention modules and the expandability of proposed network. For semantic understanding on learned features, we also visualize intermediate layers and plot the curve of layer scaling coefficients(i.e., layer attention). Recurrent Layer Attention network achieves significant performance enhancement requiring a slight increase on parameters in an image classification task with CIFAR and ImageNet-1K 2012 dataset and an object detection task with Microsoft COCO 2014 dataset.	4	162	4	0	23	6.382716049382715
10	"In this work, we propose a goal-driven collaborative task that contains language, vision, and action in a virtual environment as its core components. Specifically, we develop a Collaborative image-Drawing game between two agents, called CoDraw. Our game is grounded in a virtual world that contains movable clip art objects. The game involves two players: a Teller and a Drawer. The Teller sees an abstract scene containing multiple clip art pieces in a semantically meaningful configuration, while the Drawer tries to reconstruct the scene on an empty canvas using available clip art pieces. The two players communicate via two-way communication using natural language. We collect the CoDraw dataset of ~10K dialogs consisting of ~138K messages exchanged between human agents. We define protocols and metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of learned agents on this testbed, highlighting the need for a novel ""crosstalk"" condition which pairs agents trained independently on disjoint subsets of the training data for evaluation. We present models for our task, including simple but effective baselines and neural network approaches trained using a combination of imitation learning and goal-driven training.

We empirically show, on both synthetic and image data, that DAC can efficiently and accurately cluster new datasets coming from the same distribution used to generate training datasets. 	3	97	4	1	0	5.958762886597937
01	The long-tail distribution of the visual world poses great challenges for deep learning based classification models on how to handle the class imbalance problem. Existing solutions usually involve class-balancing strategies, e.g., by loss re-weighting, data re-sampling, or transfer learning from head- to tail-classes, but most of them adhere to the scheme of jointly learning representations and classifiers. In this work, we decouple the learning procedure into representation learning and classification, and systematically explore how different balancing strategies affect them for long-tailed recognition. The findings are surprising: (1) data imbalance might not be an issue in learning high-quality representations; (2) with representations learned with the simplest instance-balanced (natural) sampling, it is also possible to achieve strong long-tailed recognition ability by adjusting only the classifier. We conduct extensive experiments and set new state-of-the-art performance on common long-tailed benchmarks like ImageNet-LT, Places-LT and iNaturalist, showing that it is possible to outperform carefully designed losses, sampling strategies, even complex modules with memory, by using a straightforward approach that decouples representation and classification.

10	In this paper, a Gaussian conditional random field model for structured binary classification (GCRFBC) is proposed. The model is applicable to classification problems with undirected graphs, intractable for standard classification CRFs. The model representation of GCRFBC is extended by latent variables which yield some appealing properties. Thanks to the GCRF latent structure, the model becomes tractable, efficient, and open to improvements previously applied to GCRF regression. Two different forms of the algorithm are presented: GCRFBCb (GCRGBC - Bayesian) and GCRFBCnb (GCRFBC - non-Bayesian). The extended method of local variational approximation of sigmoid function is used for solving empirical Bayes in GCRFBCb variant, whereas MAP value of latent variables is the basis for learning and inference in the GCRFBCnb variant. The inference in GCRFBCb is solved by Newton-Cotes formulas for one-dimensional integration. Both models are evaluated on synthetic data and real-world data. It was shown that both models achieve better prediction performance than relevant baselines. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed models are discussed.	6	163	5	1	0	6.079754601226994

10	For AI systems to garner widespread public acceptance, we must develop methods capable of explaining the decisions of black-box models such as neural networks. In this work, we identify two issues of current explanatory methods. First, we show that two prevalent perspectives on explanations—feature-additivity and feature-selection—lead to fundamentally different instance-wise explanations. In the literature, explainers from different perspectives are currently being directly compared, despite their distinct explanation goals. The second issue is that current post-hoc explainers have only been thoroughly validated on simple models, such as linear regression, and, when applied to real-world neural networks, explainers are commonly evaluated under the assumption that the learned models behave reasonably. However, neural networks often rely on unreasonable correlations, even when producing correct decisions. We introduce a verification framework for explanatory methods under the feature-selection perspective. Our framework is based on a non-trivial neural network architecture trained on a real-world task, and for which we are able to provide guarantees on its inner workings. We validate the efficacy of our evaluation by showing the failure modes of current explainers. We aim for this framework to provide a publicly available,1 off-the-shelf evaluation when the feature-selection perspective on explanations is needed.	9	196	2	0	13	6.3265306122448965
01	Deep learning has yielded state-of-the-art performance on many natural language processing tasks including named entity recognition (NER). However, this typically requires large amounts of labeled data. In this work, we demonstrate that the amount of labeled training data can be drastically reduced when deep learning is combined with active learning. While active learning is sample-efficient, it can be computationally expensive since it requires iterative retraining. To speed this up, we introduce a lightweight architecture for NER, viz., the CNN-CNN-LSTM model consisting of convolutional character and word encoders and a  long short term memory (LSTM) tag decoder. The model achieves nearly state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets for the task while being computationally much more efficient than best performing models. We carry out incremental active learning, during the training process, and are able to nearly match state-of-the-art performance with just 25\% of the original training data.	7	144	3	0	30	6.041666666666668
10	Deep neural networks provide state-of-the-art performance for many applications of interest. Unfortunately they are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, formed by applying small but malicious perturbations to the original inputs. Moreover, the perturbations can transfer across models: adversarial examples generated for a specific model will often mislead other unseen models. Consequently  the adversary can leverage it to attack against the deployed black-box systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into two components: model-specific and data-dependent one, and it is the latter that mainly contributes to the transferability. Motivated by this understanding, we propose to craft adversarial examples by utilizing the noise reduced gradient (NRG) which approximates the data-dependent component. Experiments on various classification models trained on ImageNet demonstrates that the new approach enhances the transferability dramatically. We also find that low-capacity models have more powerful attack capability than high-capacity counterparts, under the condition that they have comparable test performance.  These insights give rise to a principled manner to construct adversarial examples with high success rates and could potentially provide us guidance for designing effective defense approaches against black-box attacks. 	10	187	4	0	17	6.454545454545454
10	Optimal Transport offers an alternative to maximum likelihood for learning generative autoencoding models. We show how this principle dictates the minimization of the Wasserstein distance between the encoder aggregated posterior and the prior, plus a reconstruction error. We prove that in the non-parametric limit the autoencoder generates the data distribution if and only if the two distributions match exactly, and that the optimum can be obtained by deterministic autoencoders.We then introduce the Sinkhorn AutoEncoder (SAE), which casts the problem into Optimal Transport on the latent space. The resulting Wasserstein distance is minimized by backpropagating through the Sinkhorn algorithm. SAE models the aggregated posterior as an implicit distribution and therefore does not need a reparameterization trick for gradients estimation. Moreover, it requires virtually no adaptation to different prior distributions. We demonstrate its flexibility by considering models with hyperspherical and Dirichlet priors, as well as a simple case of probabilistic programming. SAE matches or outperforms other autoencoding models in visual quality and FID scores. 	2	163	4	0	0	6.128834355828223
10	Recent semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods often have a teacher to train a student in order to propagate labels from labeled data to unlabeled data. We argue that a weakness of these methods is that the teacher does not learn from the student’s mistakes during the course of student’s learning.  To address this weakness, we introduce Coaching, a framework where a teacher generates pseudo labels for unlabeled data, from which a student will learn and the student’s performance on labeled data will be used as reward to train the teacher using policy gradient.Our experiments show that Coaching significantly improves over state-of-the-art SSL baselines. For instance, on CIFAR-10, with only 4,000 labeled examples, a WideResNet-28-2 trained by Coaching achieves 96.11% accuracy, which is better than 94.9% achieved by the same architecture trained with 45,000 labeled. On ImageNet with 10% labeled examples, Coaching trains a ResNet-50 to 72.94% top-1 accuracy, comfortably outperforming the existing state-of-the-art by more than 4%. Coaching also scales successfully to the high data regime with full ImageNet. Specifically, with additional 9 million unlabeled images from OpenImages, Coaching trains a ResNet-50 to 82.34% top-1 accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art for the architecture on ImageNet without using extra labeled data.	4	200	5	0	0	5.72
10	"Current knowledge distillation methods require full training data to distill knowledge from a large ""teacher"" network to a compact ""student"" network by matching certain statistics between ""teacher"" and ""student"" such as softmax outputs and feature responses. This is not only time-consuming but also inconsistent with human cognition in which children can learn knowledge from adults with few examples. This paper proposes a novel and simple method for knowledge distillation from few samples. Taking the assumption that both ""teacher"" and ""student"" have the same  feature map sizes at each corresponding block, we add a $1\times 1$ conv-layer at the end of each block in the student-net, and align the block-level outputs between ""teacher"" and ""student"" by estimating the parameters of the added layer with limited samples. We prove that the added layer can be absorbed/merged into the previous conv-layer \hl{to formulate a new conv-layer with the same size of parameters and computation cost as previous one. Experiments verifies that the proposed method is very efficient and effective to distill knowledge from teacher-net to student-net constructing in different ways on various datasets."	5	180	3	0	14	5.633333333333334
01	Exciting new work on generalization bounds for neural networks (NN) given by Bartlett et al. (2017); Neyshabur et al. (2018) closely depend on two parameter- dependant quantities: the Lipschitz constant upper bound and the stable rank (a softer version of rank). Even though these bounds typically have minimal practical utility, they facilitate questions on whether controlling such quantities together could improve the generalization behaviour of NNs in practice. To this end, we propose stable rank normalization (SRN), a novel, provably optimal, and computationally efficient weight-normalization scheme which minimizes the stable rank of a linear operator. Surprisingly we find that SRN, despite being non-convex, can be shown to have a unique optimal solution. We provide extensive analyses across a wide variety of NNs (DenseNet, WideResNet, ResNet, Alexnet, VGG), where applying SRN to their linear layers leads to improved classification accuracy, while simultaneously showing improvements in genealization, evaluated empirically using—(a) shattering experiments (Zhang et al., 2016); and (b) three measures of sample complexity by Bartlett et al. (2017), Neyshabur et al. (2018), & Wei & Ma. Additionally, we show that, when applied to the discriminator of GANs, it improves Inception, FID, and Neural divergence scores, while learning mappings with low empirical Lipschitz constant.	11	201	3	0	22	5.940298507462686
10	The performance of deep neural networks is often attributed to their automated, task-related feature construction. It remains an open question, though, why this leads to solutions with good generalization, even in cases where the number of parameters is larger than the number of samples. Back in the 90s, Hochreiter and Schmidhuber observed that flatness of the loss surface around a local minimum correlates with low generalization error. For several flatness measures, this correlation has been empirically validated. However, it has recently been shown that existing measures of flatness cannot theoretically be related to generalization: if a network uses ReLU activations, the network function can be reparameterized without changing its output in such a way that flatness is changed almost arbitrarily. This paper proposes a natural modification of existing flatness measures that results in invariance to reparameterization. The proposed measures imply a robustness of the network to changes in the input and the hidden layers. Connecting this feature robustness to generalization leads to a generalized definition of the representativeness of data. With this, the generalization error of a model trained on representative data can be bounded by its feature robustness which depends on our novel flatness measure.	9	196	6	0	35	5.744897959183674
10	"End-to-end models have achieved considerable success in task-oriented dialogue area, but suffer from the challenges of (a) poor semantic control, and (b) little interaction with auxiliary information. In this paper, we propose a novel yet simple end-to-end model for response generation via mixed templates, which can address above challenges. In our model, we retrieval candidate responses which contain abundant syntactic and sequence information by dialogue semantic information related to dialogue history. Then, we exploit candidate response attention to get templates which should be mentioned in response. Our model can integrate multi template information to guide the decoder module how to generate response better. We show that our proposed model learns useful templates information, which improves the performance of ""how to say"" and ""what to say"" in response generation. Experiments on the large-scale Multiwoz dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, which attain the state-of-the-art performance."	10	146	3	0	9	6.0616438356164375
01	Recent advances in learning from demonstrations (LfD) with deep neural networks have enabled learning complex robot skills that involve high dimensional perception such as raw image inputs. LfD algorithms generally assume learning from single task demonstrations. In practice, however, it is more efficient for a teacher to demonstrate a multitude of tasks without careful task set up, labeling, and engineering. Unfortunately in such cases, traditional imitation learning techniques fail to represent the multi-modal nature of the data, and often result in sub-optimal behavior. In this paper we present an LfD approach for learning multiple modes of behavior from visual data. Our approach is based on a stochastic deep neural network (SNN), which represents the underlying intention in the demonstration as a stochastic activation in the network. We present an efficient algorithm for training SNNs, and for learning with vision inputs, we also propose an architecture that associates the intention with a stochastic attention module.We demonstrate our method on real robot visual object reaching tasks, and show thatit can reliably learn the multiple behavior modes in the demonstration data.

01	Training a model to perform a task typically requires a large amount of data from the domains in which the task will be applied.However, it is often the case that data are abundant in some domains but scarce in others. Domain adaptation deals with the challenge of adapting a model trained from a data-rich source domain to perform well in a data-poor target domain. In general, this requires learning plausible mappings between domains. CycleGAN is a powerful framework that efficiently learns to map inputs from one domain to another using adversarial training and a cycle-consistency constraint. However, the conventional approach of enforcing cycle-consistency via reconstruction may be overly restrictive in cases where one or more domains have limited training data. In this paper, we propose an augmented cyclic adversarial learning model that enforces the cycle-consistency constraint via an external task specific model, which encourages the preservation of task-relevant content as opposed to exact reconstruction. We explore digit classification in a low-resource setting in supervised, semi and unsupervised situation, as well as high resource unsupervised. In low-resource supervised setting, the results show that our approach improves absolute performance by 14% and 4% when adapting SVHN to MNIST and vice versa, respectively, which outperforms unsupervised domain adaptation methods that require high-resource unlabeled target domain.  Moreover, using only few unsupervised target data, our approach can still outperforms many high-resource unsupervised models. Our model also outperforms on USPS to MNIST and synthetic digit to SVHN for high resource unsupervised adaptation. In speech domains, we similarly adopt a speech recognition model from each domain as the task specific model. Our approach improves absolute performance of speech recognition by 2% for female speakers in the TIMIT dataset, where the majority of training samples are from male voices.	9	292	4	0	22	5.773972602739726
01	"We study the problem of generating source code in a strongly typed,Java-like programming language, given a label (for example a set ofAPI calls or types) carrying a small amount of information about thecode that is desired. The generated programs are expected to respect a`""realistic"" relationship between programs and labels, as exemplifiedby a corpus of labeled programs available during training.Two challenges in such *conditional program generation* are thatthe generated programs must satisfy a rich set of syntactic andsemantic constraints, and that source code contains many low-levelfeatures that impede learning.  We address these problems by traininga neural generator not on code but on *program sketches*, ormodels of program syntax that abstract out names and operations thatdo not generalize across programs. During generation, we infer aposterior distribution over sketches, then concretize samples fromthis distribution into type-safe programs using combinatorialtechniques.  We implement our ideas in a system for generatingAPI-heavy Java code, and show that it can often predict the entirebody of a method given just a few API calls or data types that appearin the method."	7	190	4	0	23	5.3578947368421055
10	We study a simple generic framework to address the issue of bad training data; both bad labels in supervised problems, and bad samples in unsupervised ones. Our approach starts by fitting a model to the whole training dataset, but then iteratively improves it by alternating between (a) revisiting the training data to select samples with lowest current loss, and (b) re-training the model on only these selected samples. It can be applied to any existing model training setting which provides a loss measure for samples, and a way to refit on new ones. We show the merit of this approach in both theory and practice We first prove statistical consistency, and linear convergence to the ground truth and global optimum, for two simpler model settings: mixed linear regression, and gaussian mixture models.  We then demonstrate its success empirically in (a) saving the accuracy of existing deep image classifiers when there are errors in the labels of training images, and (b) improving the quality of samples generated by existing DC-GAN models, when it is given training data that contains a fraction of the images from a different and unintended dataset.  The experimental results show  significant improvement over the baseline methods that ignore the existence of bad labels/samples. 	5	206	3	0	18	5.242718446601941
10	While progress has been made in crafting visually imperceptible adversarial examples, constructing semantically meaningful ones remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework to generate semantics preserving adversarial examples. First, we present a manifold learning method to capture the semantics of the inputs. The motivating principle is to learn the low-dimensional geometric summaries of the inputs via statistical inference. Then, we perturb the elements of the learned manifold using the Gram-Schmidt process to induce the perturbed elements to remain in the manifold. To produce adversarial examples, we propose an efficient algorithm whereby we leverage the semantics of the inputs as a source of knowledge upon which we impose adversarial constraints. We apply our approach on toy data, images and text, and show its effectiveness in producing semantics preserving adversarial examples which evade existing defenses against adversarial attacks.	4	139	3	0	18	5.971223021582732
10	Compressing deep neural networks (DNNs) is important for real-world applications operating on resource-constrained devices. However, it is difficult to change the model size once the training is completed, which needs re-training to configure models suitable for different devices. In this paper, we propose a novel method that enables DNNs to flexibly change their size after training. We factorize the weight matrices of the DNNs via singular value decomposition (SVD) and change their ranks according to the target size. In contrast with existing methods, we introduce simple criteria that characterize the importance of each basis and layer, which enables to effectively compress the error and complexity of models as little as possible. In experiments on multiple image-classification tasks, our method exhibits favorable performance compared with other methods.	8	126	4	0	40	5.8888888888888875
10	Accurate spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is a fundamental task that has wide applications in city management, transportation area and financial domain. There are many factors that make this significant task also challenging, like: (1) maze-like road network makes the spatial dependency complex; (2) the traffic-time relationships bring non-linear temporal complication; (3) with the larger road network, the difficulty of flow forecasting grows. The prevalent and state-of-the-art methods have mainly been discussed on datasets covering relatively small districts and short time span, e.g., the dataset that is collected within a city during months. To forecast the traffic flow across a wide area and overcome the mentioned challenges, we design and propose a promising forecasting model called Layerwise Recurrent Autoencoder (LRA), in which a three-layer stacked autoencoder (SAE) architecture is used to obtain temporal traffic correlations and a recurrent neural networks (RNNs) model for prediction. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs) model is also employed to extract spatial traffic information within the transport topology for more accurate prediction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no general and effective method for traffic flow prediction in large area which covers a group of cities. The experiment is completed on such large scale real-world traffic datasets to show superiority. And a smaller dataset is exploited to prove universality of the proposed model. And evaluations show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by 6% - 15%.	9	231	4	0	15	5.874458874458875
10	Neural network models are resource hungry. Low bit quantization such as binary and ternary quantization is a common approach to alleviate this resource requirements. Ternary quantization provides a more flexible model and often beats binary quantization in terms of accuracy, but doubles memory and increases computation cost. Mixed quantization depth models, on another hand, allows a trade-off between accuracy and memory footprint. In such models, quantization depth is often chosen manually (which is a tiring task), or is tuned using a separate optimization routine (which requires training a quantized network multiple times). Here, we propose Smart Ternary Quantization (STQ) in which we modify the quantization depth directly through an adaptive regularization function, so that we train a model only once. This method jumps between binary and ternary quantization while training. We show its application  on image classification.	3	137	0	0	0	5.846715328467154
10	Clustering algorithms have wide applications and play an important role in data analysis fields including time series data analysis. The performance of a clustering algorithm depends on the features extracted from the data. However, in time series analysis, there has been a problem that the conventional methods based on the signal shape are unstable for phase shift, amplitude and signal length variations.In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm focused on the dynamical system aspect of the signal using recurrent neural network and variational Bayes method. Our experiments show that our proposed algorithm has a robustness against above variations and boost the classification performance.	10	106	7	1	11	5.6886792452830175
01	One of the mysteries in the success of neural networks is randomly initialized first order methods like gradient descent can achieve zero training loss even though the objective function is non-convex and non-smooth. This paper demystifies this surprising phenomenon for two-layer fully connected ReLU activated neural networks. For an $m$ hidden node shallow neural network with ReLU activation and $n$ training data, we show as long as $m$ is large enough and no two inputs are parallel, randomly initialized gradient descent converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the quadratic loss function.Our analysis relies on the following observation: over-parameterization and random initialization jointly restrict every weight vector to be close to its initialization for all iterations, which allows us to exploit a strong convexity-like property to show that gradient descent converges at a global linear rate to the global optimum. We believe these insights are also useful in analyzing deep models and other first order methods.	7	162	4	0	16	5.574074074074074
10	Despite its omnipresence in robotics application, the nature of spatial knowledge and the mechanisms that underlie its emergence in autonomous agents are still poorly understood. Recent theoretical work suggests that the concept of space can be grounded by capturing invariants induced by the structure of space in an agent's raw sensorimotor experience. Moreover, it is hypothesized that capturing these invariants is beneficial for a naive agent trying to predict its sensorimotor experience. Under certain exploratory conditions, spatial representations should thus emerge as a byproduct of learning to predict.We propose a simple sensorimotor predictive scheme, apply it to different agents and types of exploration, and evaluate the pertinence of this hypothesis. We show that a naive agent can capture the topology and metric regularity of its spatial configuration without any a priori knowledge, nor extraneous supervision.	8	136	5	0	18	5.860294117647059
10	Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provides a mathematically grounded framework to quantify uncertainty. However BNNs are computationally inefficient,thus are generally not employed on complicated machine learning tasks. DeepEnsembles were introduced as a Bootstrap inspired frequentist approach to thecommunity, as an alternative to BNN’s. Ensembles of deterministic and stochastic networks are a good uncertainty estimator in various applications (Although,they are criticized for not being Bayesian). We show Ensembles of deterministicand stochastic Neural Networks can indeed be cast as an approximate Bayesianinference. Deep Ensembles have another weakness of having high space complexity, we provide an alternative to it by modifying the original Bayes by Backprop (BBB) algorithm to learn more general concrete mixture distributions overweights. We show our methods and its variants can give better uncertainty estimates at a significantly lower parametric overhead than Deep Ensembles. Wevalidate our hypothesis through experiments like non-linear regression, predictiveuncertainty estimation, detecting adversarial images and exploration-exploitationtrade-off in reinforcement learning.	6	161	3	1	7	6.472049689440992
10	We focus on temporal self-supervision for GAN-based video generation tasks. While adversarial training successfully yields generative models for a variety of areas, temporal relationship in the generated data is much less explored. This is crucial for sequential generation tasks, e.g. video super-resolution and unpaired video translation. For the former, state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as L2 over adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads to temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For unpaired video translation, existing approaches modify the generator networks to form spatio-temporal cycle consistencies. In contrast, we focus on improving the learning objectives and propose a temporally self-supervised algorithm. For both tasks, we show that temporal adversarial learning is key to achieving temporally coherent solutions without sacrificing spatial detail. We also propose a novel Ping-Pong loss to improve the long-term temporal consistency. It effectively prevents recurrent networks from accumulating artifacts temporally without depressing detailed features. We also propose a first set of metrics to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy as well as the perceptual quality of the temporal evolution. A series of user studies confirms the rankings computed with these metrics.	9	190	7	0	11	6.2368421052631575
01	"We propose a ""plan online and learn offline"" framework for the setting where an agent, with an internal model, needs to continually act and learn in the world. Our work builds on the synergistic relationship between local model-based control, global value function learning, and exploration. We study how local trajectory optimization can cope with approximation errors  in the value function, and can stabilize and accelerate value function learning. Conversely, we also study how approximate value functions can help reduce the planning horizon and allow for better policies beyond local solutions. Finally, we also demonstrate how trajectory optimization can be used to perform temporally coordinated exploration in conjunction with estimating uncertainty in value function approximation. This exploration is critical for fast and stable learning of the value function. Combining these components enable solutions to complex control tasks, like humanoid locomotion and dexterous in-hand manipulation, in the equivalent of a few minutes of experience in the real world."	11	156	3	0	15	5.865384615384616
01	Storage assignment, the act of choosing what goods are placed in what locations in a warehouse, is a central problem of supply chain logistics. Past literature has shown that the optimal method to assign pallets is to arrange them in increasing duration of stay in the warehouse (the Duration-of-Stay, or DoS, method), but the methodology requires perfect prior knowledge of DoS for each pallet, which is unknown and uncertain under realistic conditions. Attempts to predict DoS have largely been unfruitful due to the multi-valuedness nature (every shipment contains multiple identical pallets with different DoS) and data sparsity induced by lack of matching historical conditions. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for storage assignment that provides a solution to the DoS prediction problem through a distributional reformulation and a novel neural network, ParallelNet. Through collaboration with a world-leading cold storage company, we show that the system is able to predict DoS with a MAPE of 29%, a decrease of ~30% compared to a CNN-LSTM model, and suffers less performance decay into the future. The framework is then integrated into a first-of-its-kind Storage Assignment system, which is being deployed in warehouses across United States, with initial results showing up to 21% in labor savings. We also release the first publicly available set of warehousing records to facilitate research into this central problem.	5	222	6	1	20	5.5

10	We present 3C-GAN: a novel multiple generators structures, that contains one conditional generator that generates a semantic part of an image conditional on its input label, and one context generator generates the rest of an image. Compared to original GAN model, this model has multiple generators and gives control over what its generators should generate. Unlike previous multi-generator models use a subsequent generation process, that one layer is generated given the previous layer, our model uses a process of generating different part of the images together. This way the model contains fewer parameters and the generation speed is faster. Speciﬁcally, the model leverages the label information to separate the object from the image correctly. Since the model conditional on the label information does not restrict to generate other parts of an image, we proposed a cost function that encourages the model to generate only the succinct part of an image in terms of label discrimination. We also found an exclusive prior on the mask of the model help separate the object. The experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA datasets show 3C-GAN can generate different objects with different generators simultaneously, according to the labels given to each generator.	10	197	0	0	0	5.4213197969543145

We believe these findings may inspire further development in designing provable algorithms for learning neural networks and other complex models. While our focus is theoretical, we also present experiments that illustrate our theoretical findings.	9	100	4	0	19	6.19
01	Finding an embedding space for a linear approximation of a nonlinear dynamical system enables efficient system identification and control synthesis. The Koopman operator theory lays the foundation for identifying the nonlinear-to-linear coordinate transformations with data-driven methods. Recently, researchers have proposed to use deep neural networks as a more expressive class of basis functions for calculating the Koopman operators. These approaches, however, assume a fixed dimensional state space; they are therefore not applicable to scenarios with a variable number of objects. In this paper, we propose to learn compositional Koopman operators, using graph neural networks to encode the state into object-centric embeddings and using a block-wise linear transition matrix to regularize the shared structure across objects. The learned dynamics can quickly adapt to new environments of unknown physical parameters and produce control signals to achieve a specified goal. Our experiments on manipulating ropes and controlling soft robots show that the proposed method has better efficiency and generalization ability than existing baselines.	7	160	3	0	11	6.19375
10	Modern convolutional networks are not shift-invariant, despite their convolutional nature: small shifts in the input can cause drastic changes in the internal feature maps and output. In this paper, we isolate the cause -- the downsampling operation in convolutional and pooling layers -- and apply the appropriate signal processing fix -- low-pass filtering before downsampling. This simple architectural modification boosts the shift-equivariance of the internal representations and consequently, shift-invariance of the output. Importantly, this is achieved while maintaining downstream classification performance. In addition, incorporating the inductive bias of shift-invariance largely removes the need for shift-based data augmentation. Lastly, we observe that the modification induces spatially-smoother learned convolutional kernels. Our results suggest that this classical signal processing technique has a place in modern deep networks.	5	124	6	0	25	6.645161290322582
10	The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with a variety of real-life applications. We tackle TSP by incorporating machine learning methodology and leveraging the variable neighborhood search strategy. More precisely, the search process is considered as a Markov decision process (MDP), where a 2-opt local search is used to search within a small neighborhood, while a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method (which iterates through simulation, selection and back-propagation steps), is used to sample a number of targeted actions within an enlarged neighborhood. This new paradigm clearly distinguishes itself from the existing machine learning (ML) based paradigms for solving the TSP, which either uses an end-to-end ML model, or simply applies traditional techniques after ML for post optimization. Experiments based on two public data sets show that, our approach clearly dominates all the existing learning based TSP algorithms in terms of performance, demonstrating its high potential on the TSP. More importantly, as a general framework without complicated hand-crafted rules, it can be readily extended to many other combinatorial optimization problems.	12	174	4	1	21	5.942528735632184
01	We propose and address a novel few-shot RL problem, where a task is characterized by a subtask graph which describes a set of subtasks and their dependencies that are unknown to the agent. The agent needs to quickly adapt to the task over few episodes during adaptation phase to maximize the return in the test phase. Instead of directly learning a meta-policy, we develop a Meta-learner with Subtask Graph Inference (MSGI), which infers the latent parameter of the task by interacting with the environment and maximizes the return given the latent parameter. To facilitate learning, we adopt an intrinsic reward inspired by upper confidence bound (UCB) that encourages efficient exploration. Our experiment results on two grid-world domains and StarCraft II environments show that the proposed method is able to accurately infer the latent task parameter, and to adapt more efficiently than existing meta RL and hierarchical RL methods.	9	148	2	0	9	5.337837837837838
10	We study the problem of alleviating the instability issue in the GAN training procedure via new architecture design. The discrepancy between the minimax and maximin objective values could serve as a proxy for the difficulties that the alternating gradient descent encounters in the optimization of GANs. In this work, we give new results on the benefits of multi-generator architecture of GANs. We show that the minimax gap shrinks to \epsilon as the number of generators increases with rate O(1/\epsilon). This improves over the best-known result of O(1/\epsilon^2). At the core of our techniques is a novel application of Shapley-Folkman lemma to the generic minimax problem, where in the literature the technique was only known to work when the objective function is restricted to the Lagrangian function of a constraint optimization problem. Our proposed Stackelberg GAN performs well experimentally in both synthetic and real-world datasets, improving Frechet Inception Distance by 14.61% over the previous multi-generator GANs on the benchmark datasets.	9	159	3	0	21	5.666666666666668
10	Wide adoption of complex RNN based models is hindered by their inference performance, cost and memory requirements. To address this issue, we develop AntMan, combining structured sparsity with low-rank decomposition synergistically, to reduce model computation, size and execution time of RNNs while attaining desired accuracy. AntMan extends knowledge distillation based training to learn the compressed models efficiently. Our evaluation shows that AntMan offers up to 100x computation reduction with less than 1pt accuracy drop for language and machine reading comprehension models. Our evaluation also shows that for a given accuracy target, AntMan produces 5x smaller models than the state-of-art. Lastly, we show that AntMan offers super-linear speed gains compared to theoretical speedup, demonstrating its practical value on commodity hardware.	8	119	7	0	21	6.168067226890758
10	Bayesian inference offers a theoretically grounded and general way to train neural networks and can potentially give calibrated uncertainty. It is, however, challenging to specify a meaningful and tractable prior over the network parameters. More crucially, many existing inference methods assume mean-field approximate posteriors, ignoring interactions between parameters in high-dimensional weight space. To this end, this paper introduces two innovations: (i) a Gaussian process-based hierarchical model for the network parameters based on recently introduced unit embeddings that can flexibly encode weight structures, and (ii) input-dependent contextual variables for the weight prior that can provide convenient ways to regularize the function space being modeled by the NN through the use of kernels. Furthermore, we develop an efficient structured variational inference scheme that alleviates the need to perform inference in the weight space whilst retaining and learning non-trivial correlations between network parameters. We show these models provide desirable test-time uncertainty estimates, demonstrate cases of modeling inductive biases for neural networks with kernels and demonstrate competitive predictive performance of the proposed model and algorithm over alternative approaches on a range of classification and active learning tasks.	6	183	4	0	26	6.415300546448088
10	The information bottleneck (IB) problem tackles the issue of obtaining relevant compressed representations T of some random variable X for the task of predicting Y. It is defined as a constrained optimization problem which maximizes the information the representation has about the task, I(T;Y), while ensuring that a minimum level of compression r is achieved (i.e., I(X;T) <= r). For practical reasons the problem is usually solved by maximizing the IB Lagrangian for many values of the Lagrange multiplier, therefore drawing the IB curve (i.e., the curve of maximal I(T;Y) for a given I(X;Y)) and selecting the representation of desired predictability and compression. It is known when Y is a deterministic function of X, the IB curve cannot be explored and other Lagrangians have been proposed to tackle this problem (e.g., the squared IB Lagrangian). In this paper we (i) present a general family of Lagrangians which allow for the exploration of the IB curve in all scenarios; (ii) prove that if these Lagrangians are used, there is a one-to-one mapping between the Lagrange multiplier and the desired compression rate r for known IB curve shapes, hence, freeing from the burden of solving the optimization problem for many values of the Lagrange multiplier.	5	203	2	1	35	5.231527093596059
